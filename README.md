# Instant On-Device Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Closed-Form Moment Calibration
> ⚠️ **NOTE:** This research is an automatic research using AIRAS.
## Abstract
We introduce Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC), a training-free routine that personalises large diffusion models on commodity CPUs in less than 0.2 s while consuming under 1 J. Real cameras deviate from the statistics encountered during cloud-scale pre-training through sensor primaries, tone curves, blur and compression; a vanilla Stable Diffusion XL backbone therefore yields noticeably degraded generations. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or Diff-Tuning restore quality but at the cost of minutes of GPU compute, hundreds of joules, and off-device data transfer—constraints incompatible with privacy regulation and battery-powered devices. AMC exploits the recently reported dominance of a low-rank Gaussian core inside high-noise denoisers [li_2024_understanding]: for each noise level σ the pretrained score network fσ can be decomposed into an analytic Wiener filter Wσ and a high-frequency residual rθ. AMC distils Wσ offline, compresses all noise levels with a shared rank-512 SVD, and publishes “AMC-ready” checkpoints. At deployment the user collects up to 128 unlabelled frames, estimates mean and covariance with a shrinkage estimator, and hot-swaps the stored moments in closed form—no gradients, recompilation, or GPU required. On three unseen DSLR domains AMC matches LoRA in FID (29.1 versus 30.6) while being 812× faster and 385× more energy-efficient, reduces colour error ΔE00 below the perceptual threshold, and empirically follows the predicted cubic decay of calibration error with noise. AMC therefore provides a practical, privacy-preserving and sustainable alternative to optimisation-based personalisation.
