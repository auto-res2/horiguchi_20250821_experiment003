Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2208.09392v1  [cs.CV]  19 Aug 20221 Introduction Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling [Ramesh et al., 2022]. Diffusion models come in many ﬂavors, but all are built around the concept of random noise removal; one trains an image restoration/denoising network that accepts an image contaminated with Gaussian noise, and outputs a denoised image. At test time, the denoising network is used to convert pure Gaussian noise into a photo-realistic image using an update rule that alternates between applying the denoiser and adding Gaussian noise. When the right sequence of updates is applied, complex generative behavior is observed. The origins of diffusion models, and also our theoretical understanding of these models, are strongly based on the role played by Gaussian noise during training and generation. Diffusion has been understood as a random walk around the image density function using Langevin dynamics [Sohl- Dickstein et al., 2015, Song and Ermon, 2019], which requires Gaussian noise in each step. The walk begins in a high temperature (heavy noise) state, and slowly anneals into a “cold” state with little if any noise. Another line of work derives the loss for the denoising network using variational inference with a Gaussian prior [Ho et al., 2020, Song et al., 2021a, Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021]. In this work, we examine the need for Gaussian noise, or any randomness at all, for diffusion models to work in practice. We consider generalized diffusion models that live outside the conﬁnes of the theoretical frameworks from which diffusion models arose. Rather than limit ourselves to models built around Gaussian noise, we consider models built around arbitrary image transformations like blurring, downsampling, etc. We train a restoration network to invert these deformations using a simple ℓp loss. When we apply a sequence of updates at test time that alternate between the image restoration model and the image degradation operation, generative behavior emerges, and we obtain photo-realistic images. The existence of cold diffusions that require no Gaussian noise (or any randomness) during training or testing raises questions about the limits of our theoretical understanding of diffusion models. It also unlocks the door for potentially new types of generative models with very different properties than conventional diffusion seen so far. 2 Background Generative models exist for a range of modalities spanning natural language [Brown et al., 2020] and images [Brock et al., 2019, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021], and they can be extended to solve important problems such as image restoration [Kawar et al., 2021a, 2022]. While GANs [Goodfellow et al., 2014] have historically been the tool of choice for image synthesis [Brock et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2019], diffusion models [Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015] have recently become competitive if not superior for some applications [Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Nichol et al., 2021, Ramesh et al., 2021, Meng et al., 2021]. Both the Langevin dynamics and variational inference interpretations of diffusion models rely on properties of the Gaussian noise used in the training and sampling pipelines. From the score-matching generative networks perspective [Song and Ermon, 2019, Song et al., 2021b], noise in the training process is critically thought to expand the support of the low-dimensional training distribution to a set of full measure in ambient space. The noise is also thought to act as data augmentation to improve score predictions in low density regions, allowing for mode mixing in the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampling. The gradient signal in low-density regions can be further improved during sampling by injecting large magnitudes of noise in the early steps of SGLD and gradually reducing this noise in later stages. Kingma et al. [2021] propose a method to learn a noise schedule that leads to faster optimization. Using a classic statistical result, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli [2021] show the connection between removing additive Gaussian noise and the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density in determin- istic linear inverse problems. Here, we shed light on the role of noise in diffusion models through theoretical and empirical results in applications to inverse problems and image generation. Iterative neural models have been used for various inverse problems [Romano et al., 2016, Metzler et al., 2017]. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to them [Song et al., 2021b] for the 2problems of deblurring, denoising, super-resolution, and compressive sensing [Whang et al., 2021, Kawar et al., 2021b, Saharia et al., 2021, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli, 2021]. Although not their focus, previous works on diffusion models have included experiments with deterministic image generation [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021] and in selected inverse problems [Kawar et al., 2022]. Here, we show deﬁnitively that noise is not a necessity in diffusion models, and we observe the effects of removing noise for a number of inverse problems. Despite proliﬁc work on generative models in recent years, methods to probe the properties of learned distributions and measure how closely they approximate the real training data are by no means closed ﬁelds of investigation. Indirect feature space similarity metrics such as Inception Score [Salimans et al., 2016], Mode Score [Che et al., 2016], Frechet inception distance (FID) [Heusel et al., 2017], and Kernel inception distance (KID) [Bi´nkowski et al., 2018] have been proposed and adopted to some extent, but they have notable limitations [Barratt and Sharma, 2018]. To adopt a popular frame of reference, we will use FID as the feature similarity metric for our experiments. 3 Generalized Diffusion Standard diffusion models are built around two components. First, there is an image degradation operator that contaminates images with Gaussian noise. Second, a trained restoration operator is created to perform denoising. The image generation process alternates between the application of these two operators. In this work, we consider the construction of generalized diffusions built around arbitrary degradation operations. These degradations can be randomized (as in the case of standard diffusion) or deterministic. 3.1 Model components and training Given an image x0 ∈RN, consider the degradation of x0 by operator Dwith severity t,denoted xt = D(x0,t). The output distribution D(x0,t) of the degradation should vary continuously in t, and the operator should satisfy D(x0,0) = x0. In the standard diffusion framework, Dadds Gaussian noise with variance proportional to t. In our generalized formulation, we choose Dto perform various other transformations such as blurring, masking out pixels, downsampling, and more, with severity that depends on t. We explore a range of choices for Din Section 4. We also require a restoration operator R that (approximately) inverts D. This operator has the property that R(xt,t) ≈x0. In practice, this operator is implemented via a neural network parameterized by θ. The restoration network is trained via the minimization problem min θ Ex∼X∥Rθ(D(x,t),t) −x∥, (1) where xdenotes a random image sampled from distribution Xand ∥·∥ denotes a norm, which we take to be ℓ1 in our experiments. We have so far used the subscript Rθ to emphasize the dependence of Ron θduring training, but we will omit this symbol for simplicity in the discussion below. 3.2 Sampling from the model After choosing a degradation Dand training a model Rto perform the restoration, these operators can be used in tandem to invert severe degradations by using standard methods borrowed from the diffusion literature. For small degradations (t≈0), a single application of Rcan be used to obtain a restored image in one shot. However, because Ris typically trained using a simple convex loss, it yields blurry results when used with large t. Rather, diffusion models [Song et al., 2021a, Ho et al., 2020] perform generation by iteratively applying the denoising operator and then adding noise back to the image, with the level of added noise decreasing over time. This corresponds to the standard update sequence in Algorithm 1. 3Algorithm 1 Naive Sampling Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = D(ˆx0,s −1) end for Return: x0 Algorithm 2 Improved Sampling for Cold Diffusion Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = xs −D(ˆx0,s) + D(ˆx0,s −1) end for When the restoration operator is perfect, i.e. when R(D(x0,t),t) = x0 for all t,one can easily see that Algorithm 1 produces exact iterates of the form xs = D(x0,s). But what happens for imperfect restoration op- erators? In this case, errors can cause the iterates xs to wander away from D(x0,s), and inaccurate reconstruction may occur. We ﬁnd that the standard sampling ap- proach in Algorithm 1 works well for noise-based diffusion, possibly because the restoration operator R has been trained to correct (random Gaussian) errors in its inputs. However, we ﬁnd that it yields poor results in the case of cold diffusions with smooth/differentiable degradations as demonstrated for a deblurring model in Figure 2. We propose Algorithm 2 for sampling, which we ﬁnd to be superior for inverting smooth, cold degradations. This sampler has important mathematical properties that enable it to recover high quality results. Speciﬁcally, for a class of linear degradation operations, it can be shown to produce exact reconstruc- tion (i.e. xs = D(x0,s)) even when the restoration operator Rfails to perfectly invert D. We discuss this in the following section. 3.3 Properties of Algorithm 2 Figure 2: Comparison of sampling methods for cold diffusion on the CelebA dataset. Top: Algorithm 1 produces compounding artifacts and fails to generate a new image. Bottom: Algorithm 2 succeeds in sam- pling a high quality image without noise. It is clear from inspection that both Algo- rithms 1 and 2 perfectly reconstruct the it- erate xs = D(x0,s) for all s < tif the restoration operator is a perfect inverse for the degradation operator. In this section, we analyze the stability of these algorithms to errors in the restoration operator. For small values of xand s, Algorithm 2 is extremely tolerant of error in the restoration operator R. To see why, consider a model problem with a linear degradation function of the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·efor some vector e. While this ansatz may seem rather restrictive, note that the Taylor expansion of any smooth degradation D(x,s) around x = x0,s = 0 has the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·e+ HOT where HOT denotes higher order terms. Note that the constant/zeroth-order term in this Taylor expansion is zero because we assumed above that the degradation operator satisﬁes D(x,0) = x. For a degradation of the form (3.3) and any restoration operator R, the update in Algorithm 2 can be written xs−1 = xs −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = D(x0,s) −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = x0 + s·e−R(xs,s) −s·e+ R(xs,s) + (s−1) ·e = x0 + (s−1) ·e = D(x0,s −1) By induction, we see that the algorithm produces the value xs = D(x0,s) for all s<t, regardless of the choice of R. In other words, for any choice of R, the iteration behaves the same as it would when Ris a perfect inverse for the degradation D. By contrast, Algorithm 1 does not enjoy this behavior. In fact, when Ris not a perfect inverse for D, x0 is not even a ﬁxed point of the update rule in Algorithm 1 becausex0 ̸= D(R(x,0),0) = R(x,0). If Rdoes not perfectly invert Dwe should expect Algorithm 1 to incur errors, even for small values 4of s. Meanwhile, for small values of s, the behavior of Dapproaches its ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion and Algorithm 2 becomes immune to errors in R. We demonstrate the stability of Algorithm 2 vs Algorithm 1 on a deblurring model in Figure 2. 4 Generalized Diffusions with Various Transformations In this section, we take the ﬁrst step towards cold diffusion by reversing different degradations and hence performing conditional generation. We will extend our methods to perform unconditional (i.e. from scratch) generation in Section 5. We emprically evaluate generalized diffusion models trained on different degradations with our improved sampling Algorithm 2. We perform experiments on the vision tasks of deblurring, inpainting, super-resolution, and the unconventional task of synthetic snow removal. We perform our experiments on MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], CIFAR-10 [Krizhevsky, 2009], and CelebA [Liu et al., 2015]. In each of these tasks, we gradually remove the information from the clean image, creating a sequence of images such that D(x0,t) retains less information than D(x0,t −1). For these different tasks, we present both qualitative and quantitative results on a held-out testing dataset and demonstrate the importance of the sampling technique described in Algorithm 2. For all quantitative results in this section, the Frechet inception distance (FID) scores [Heusel et al., 2017] for degraded and reconstructed images are measured with respect to the testing data. Additional information about the quantitative results, convergence criteria, hyperparameters, and architecture of the models presented below can be found in the appendix. 4.1 Deblurring We consider a generalized diffusion based on a Gaussian blur operation (as opposed to Gaussian noise) in which an image at stepthas more blur than att−1. The forward process given the Gaussian kernels {Gs}and the image xt−1 at step t−1 can thus be written as xt = Gt ∗xt−1 = Gt ∗... ∗G1 ∗x0 = ¯Gt ∗x0 = D(x0,t), (2) where ∗denotes the convolution operator, which blurs an image using a kernel. We train a deblurring model by minimizing the loss (1), and then use Algorithm 2 to invert this blurred diffusion process for which we trained a DNN to predict the clean image ˆx0. Qualitative results are shown in Figure 3 and quantitative results in Table 1. Qualitatively, we can see that images created using the sampling process are sharper and in some cases completely different as compared to the direct reconstruction of the clean image. Quantitatively we can see that the reconstruction metrics such as RMSE and PSNR get worse when we use the sampling process, but on the other hand FID with respect to held-out test data improves. The qualitative improvements and decrease in FID show the beneﬁts of the generalized sampling routine, which brings the learned distribution closer to the true data manifold. In the case of blur operator, the sampling routine can be thought of adding frequencies at each step. This is because the sampling routine involves the term D( ˆx0,t) −D( ˆx0,t −1) which in the case of blur becomes ¯Gt ∗x0 −¯Gt−1 ∗x0. This results in a difference of Gaussians, which is a band pass ﬁlter and contains frequencies that were removed at step t. Thus, in the sampling process, we sequentially add the frequencies that were removed during the degradation process. Degraded Direct Alg.

We remove pixels using a Gaussian mask as follows: For input images of size n×nwe start with a 2D Gaussian curve of variance β,discretized into an n×narray. We normalize so the peak of the curve has value 1, and subtract the result from 1 so the center of the mask as value 0. We randomize the location of the Gaussian mask for MNIST and CIFAR-10, but keep it centered for CelebA. We denote the ﬁnal mask by zβ. Input images x0 are iteratively masked for T steps via multiplication with a sequence of masks {zβi } with increasing βi. We can control the amount of information removed at each step by tuning the βi parameter. In the language of Section 3, D(x0,t) = x0 ·∏t i=1 zβi , where the operator ·denotes entry-wise multiplication. Figure 4 presents results on test images and compares the output of the inpainting model to the original image. The reconstructed images display reconstructed features qualitatively consistent with the context provided by the unperturbed regions of the image. We quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the inpainting models on each of the datasets by comparing distributional similarity metrics before and after the reconstruction. Our results are summarized in Table 2. Note, the FID scores here are computed with respect to the held-out validation set.

This takes place, once for each values of t, until a ﬁnal resolution is reached, 4 ×4 in the case of MNIST and CIFAR-10 and 2 ×2 in the case of Celeb-A. After each down-sampling, the lower- resolution image is resized to the original image size, using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that generalized diffusion can succeed even with exotic transforms that lack the scale-space and compositional properties of blur operators. Similar to other tasks, we degrade the images by adding snow, such that the level of snow increases with step t. We provide more implementation details in Appendix. We illustrate our desnowiﬁcation results in Figure 6. We present testing examples, as well as their snowiﬁed images, from all the datasets, and compare the desnowiﬁed results with the original images. The desnowiﬁed images feature near-perfect reconstruction results for CIFAR-10 examples with lighter snow, and exhibit visually distinctive restoration for Celeb-A examples with heavy snow. We provide quantitative results in Table 4. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 6: Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets.

We will ﬁrst discuss deterministic generation using Gaussian noise 7Table 4: Quantitative metrics for quality of image reconstruction using desnowiﬁcation models.

Finally, we provide a proof of concept that the Algorithm 2 can be extended to other degradations. 5.1 Generation using deterministic noise degradation Here we discuss image generation using noise-based degradation. We consider “deterministic” sampling in which the noise pattern is selected and frozen at the start of the generation process, and then treated as a constant. We study two ways of applying Algorithm 2 with ﬁxed noise. We ﬁrst deﬁne D(x,t) = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz, as the (deterministic) interpolation between data point xand a ﬁxed noise pattern z∈N(0,1), for increasing αt <αt−1, ∀1 ≤t≤T as in Song et al. [2021a]. Algorithm 2 can be applied in this case by ﬁxing the noise zused in the degradation operatorD(x,s). Alternatively, one can deterministically calculate the noise vector zto be used in step tof reconstruction by using the formula ˆz(xt,t) = xt −√αtR(xt,t)√1 −αt . The second method turns out to be closely related to the deterministic sampling proposed in Song et al. [2021a], with some differences in the formulation of the training objective. We discuss this relationship in detail in Appendix A.6. We present quantitative results for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using the ﬁxed noise method and the estimated noise method (using ˆz) in Table 5. 5.2 Image generation using blur The forward diffusion process in noise-based diffusion models has the advantage that the degraded image distribution at the ﬁnal step T is simply an isotropic Gaussian. One can therefore perform (unconditional) generation by ﬁrst drawing a sample from the isotropic Gaussian, and sequentially denoising it with backward diffusion. When using blur as a degradation, the fully degraded images do not form a nice closed-form distribution that we can sample from. They do, however, form a simple enough distribution that can be modeled with simple methods. Note that every image x0 degenerates to an xT that is constant (i.e., every pixel is the same color) for largeT. Furthermore, the constant value is exactly the channel-wise mean of the RGB image x0, and can be represented with a 3-vector. This 3-dimensional distribution is easily represented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). This GMM can be sampled to produce the random pixel values of a severely blurred image, which can be deblurred using cold diffusion to create a new image. Our generative model uses a blurring schedule where we progressively blur each image with a Gaussian kernel of size 27x27 over 300 steps. The standard deviation of the kernel starts at 1 and increases exponentially at the rate of 0.01. We then ﬁt a simple GMM with one component to the distribution of channel-wise means. To generate an image from scratch, we sample the channel-wise mean from the GMM, expand the 3D vector into a 128 ×128 image with three channels, and then apply Algorithm 2. Empirically, the presented pipeline generates images with high ﬁdelity but low diversity, as reﬂected quantitatively by comparing the perfect symmetry column with results from hot diffusion in Table 5. We attribute this to the perfect correlation between pixels of xT sampled from the channel-wise mean Gaussian mixture model. To break the symmetry between pixels, we add a small amount of Gaussian noise (of standard deviation 0.002) to each sampled xT. As shown in Table 5, the simple trick drastically improves the quality of generated images. We also present the qualitative results for cold diffusion using blur transformation in Figure 7, and further discuss the necessity of Algorithm 2 8for generation in Appendix A.7. Table 5: FID scores for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using hot (using noise) and cold diffusion (using blur transformation). This table shows that This table also shows that breaking the symmetry withing pixels of the same channel further improves the FID scores.

Speciﬁcally, we show preliminary results on inpainting, super-resolution, and animorphosis. Inspired by the simplicity of the degraded image distribution for the blurring routine presented in the previous section, we use degradation routines with predictable ﬁnal distributions here as well. To use the Gaussian mask transformation for generation, we modify the masking routine so the ﬁnal degraded image is completely devoid of information. One might think a natural option is to send all of the images to a completely black image xT, but this would not allow for any diversity in generation. To get around this maximally non-injective property, we instead make the mask turn all pixels to a random, solid color. This still removes all of the information from the image, but it allows us to recover different samples from the learned distribution via Algorithm 2 by starting off with different color images. More formally, a Gaussian mask Gt = ∏t i=1 zβi is created in a similar way as discussed in the Section 4.2, but instead of multiplying it directly to the image x0, we create xt as follows: xt = Gt ∗x0 + (1 −Gt) ∗c where cis an image of a randomly sampled color. For super-resolution, the routine down-samples to a resolution of 2 ×2, or 4 values in each channel. These degraded images can be represented as one-dimensional vectors, and their distribution is modeled using one Gaussian distribution. Using the same methods described for generation using 9blurring described above, we sample from this Gaussian-ﬁtted distribution of the lower-dimensional degraded image space and pass this sampled point through the generation process trained on super- resolution data to create one output. Additionally to show one can invert nearly any transformation, we include a new transformation deemed animorphosis, where we iteratively transform a human face from CelebA to an animal face from AFHQ. Though we chose CelebA and AFHQ for our experimentation, in principle such interpolation can be done for any two initial data distributions. More formally, given an image xand a random image zsampled from the AFHQ manifold, xt can be written as follows: xt = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz Note this is essentially the same as the noising procedure, but instead of adding noise we are adding a progressively higher weighted AFHQ image. In order to sample from the learned distribution, we sample a random image of an animal and use Algorithm 2 to reverse theanimorphosis transformation. We present results for the CelebA dataset, and hence the quantitative results in terms of FID scores for inpainting, super-resolution and animorphosis are 90.14, 92.91 and 48.51 respectively. We further show some qualitative samples in Figure 8, and in Figure 1. Figure 8: Preliminary demonstration of the generative abilities of other cold diffusins on the128×128 CelebA dataset. The top row is with animorphosis models, the middle row is with inpainting models, and the bottom row exhibits super-resolution models. 6 Conclusion Existing diffusion models rely on Gaussian noise for both forward and reverse processes. In this work, we ﬁnd that the random noise can be removed entirely from the diffusion model framework, and replaced with arbitrary transforms. In doing so, our generalization of diffusion models and their sampling procedures allows us to restore images afﬂicted by deterministic degradations such as blur, inpainting and downsampling. This framework paves the way for a more diverse landscape of diffusion models beyond the Gaussian noise paradigm. The different properties of these diffusions may prove useful for a range of applications, including image generation and beyond. References Shane Barratt and Rishi Sharma.

LOGAN: latent optimisation for generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00953, 2019. 12A Appendix A.1 Deblurring For the deblurring experiments, we train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The training was done on the batch size of 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995 which is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For the MNIST dataset, we blur recursively 40 times, with a discrete Gaussian kernel of size 11x11 and a standard deviation 7. In the case of CIFAR-10, we recursively blur with a Gaussian kernel of ﬁxed size 11x11, but at each step t, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is given by 0.01 ∗t+ 0.35. The blur routine for CelebA dataset involves blurring images with a Gaussian kernel of 15x15 and the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel grows exponentially with time tat the rate of 0.01. Figure 9 shows an additional nine images for each of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Figures 19 and 20 show the iterative sampling process using a deblurring model for ten example images from each dataset. We further show 400 random images to demonstrate the qualitative results in the Figure 21. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 9: Additional examples from deblurring models trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. A.2 Inpainting For the inpainting transformation, models were trained on different datasets with 60,000 gradient steps. The models were trained using Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2×10−5. We use batch size 64, and the gradients are accumulated after every 2 steps. The ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. This EMA model is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For all our inpainting experiments we use a randomized Gaussian mask and T = 50 with β1 = 1 and βi+1 = βi + 0.1. To avoid potential leakage of information due to ﬂoating point computation of the Gaussian mask, we discretize the masked image before passing it through the inpainting model. This was done by rounding all pixel values to the eight most signiﬁcant digits. 13Figure 11 shows nine additional inpainting examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 10 demonstrates an example of the iterative sampling process of an inpainting model for one image in each dataset. A.3 Super-Resolution We train the super-resolution model per Section 3.1 for 700,000 iterations. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The batch size is 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. The number of time-steps depends on the size of the input image and the ﬁnal image. For MNIST and for CIFAR10, the number of time steps is 3, as it takes three steps of halving the resolution to reduce the initial image down to 4 ×4. For CelebA, the number of time steps is 6 to reduce the initial image down to 2 ×2. For CIFAR10, we apply random crop and random horizontal ﬂip for regularization. Figure 13 shows an additional nine super-resolution examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 12 shows one example of the progressive increase in resolution achieved with the sampling process using a super-resolution model for each dataset. A.4 Colorization Here we provide results for the additional task of colorization. Starting with the original RGB- image x0, we realize colorization by iteratively desaturating for T steps until the ﬁnal image xT is a fully gray-scale image. We use a series of three-channel 1 ×1 convolution ﬁlters z(α) = {z1(α),z2(α),z3(α)}with the form z1(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (1 0 0) z2(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 1 0) z3(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 0 1) and obtain D(x,t) = z(αt) ∗xvia a schedule deﬁned as α1,...,α t for each respective step. Notice that a gray image is obtained when xT = z(1) ∗x0. We can tune the ratio αt to control the amount of information removed in each step. For our experiment, we schedule the ratio such that for every twe have xt = z(αt) ∗... ∗z(α1) ∗x0 = z( t T) ∗x0. This schedule ensures that color information lost between steps is smaller in earlier stage of the diffusion and becomes larger as tincreases. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 50 and for CelebA we use T = 20.

Figure 12: Progressive upsampling of selected downsampled MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA images. The original image is at the left for each of these progressive upsamplings. We illustrate our recolorization results in Figure 14. We present testing examples, as well as their grey scale images, from all the datasets, and compare the recolorization results with the original images. The recolored images feature correct color separation between different regions, and feature various and yet semantically correct colorization of objects. Our sampling technique still yields minor differences in comparison to the direct reconstruction, although the change is not visually apparent. We attribute this to the shape restriction of colorization task, as human perception is rather insensitive to minor color change. We also provide quantitative measurement for the effectiveness of our recolorization results in terms of different similarity metrics, and summarize the results in Table 6.

A.5 Image Snow Here we provide results for the additional task of snowiﬁcation, which is a direct adaptation of the ofﬁcal implementation of ImageNet-C snowiﬁcation process [Hendrycks and Dietterich, 2019]. To determine the snow pattern of a given image x0 ∈RC×H×W, we ﬁrst construct a seed matrix SA ∈RH×W where each entry is sampled from a Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ). The upper-left corner of SA is then zoomed into another matrix SB ∈RH×W with spline interpolation. Next, we create a new matrix SC by ﬁltering each value of SB with a given threshold c1 as SC[i][j] = {0, S B[i][j] ≤c1 SB[i][j], S B[i][j] >c1 and clip each entry of SC into the range [0,1]. We then convolve SC using a motion blur kernel with standard deviation c2 to create the snow pattern Sand its up-side-down rotation S′. The direction of the motional blur kernel is randomly chosen as either vertical or horizontal. The ﬁnal snow image is 16created by again clipping each value of x0 + S+ S′into the range [0,1]. For simplicity, we abstract the process as a function h(x0,SA,c0,c1). Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 15: Additional examples from Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. To create a series ofT images with increasing snowiﬁcation, we linearly interpolatec0 and c1 between [cstart 0 ,cend 0 ] and [cstart 1 ,cend 1 ] respectively, to create c0(t) and c1(t), t= 1,...,T . Then for each x0, a seed matrix Sx is sampled, the motion blur direction is randomized, and we construct each related xt by xt = h(x0,Sx,c0(t),c1(t)). Visually, c0(t) dictates the severity of the snow, while c1(t) determines how “windy\" the snowiﬁed image seems. For both CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A, we use the same Gaussian distribution with parameters µ= 0.55 and σ = 0 .3 to generate the seed matrix. For CIFAR-10, we choose cstart 0 = 1 .15, cend 0 = 0 .7, cstart 1 = 0 .05 and cend 1 = 16 , which generates a visually lighter snow. For Celeb-A, we choose cstart 0 = 1.15, cend 0 = 0.55, cstart 1 = 0.05 and cend 1 = 20, which generates a visually heavier snow. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 200 and for CelebA we use T = 200. We note that the seed matrix is resampled for each individual training batch, and hence the snow pattern varies across the training stage. A.6 Generation using noise : Further Details Here we will discuss in further detail on the similarity between the sampling method proposed in Algorithm 2 and the deterministic sampling in DDIM [Song et al., 2021a]. Given the image xt at step t, we have the restored clean image ˆx0 from the diffusion model. Hence given the estimated ˆx0 and xt, we can estimate the noise z(xt,t) (or ˆz) as z(xt,t) = xt −√αt ˆx0√1 −αt , Thus, the D( ˆx0,t) and D( ˆx0,t −1) can be written as D( ˆx0,t) = √αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz, D( ˆx0,t −1) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz, using which the sampling process in Algorithm 2 to estimate xt−1 can be written as, 17xt−1 = xt −D( ˆx0,t) + D( ˆx0,t −1) = xt −(√αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz) + (√αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz (3) which is same as the sampling method as described in [Song et al., 2021a]. A.7 Generation using blur transformation: Further Details Figure 16: Examples of generated samples from 128×128 CelebA and AFHQ datasets using Method 2 with perfect symmetry. The Figure 16, shows the generation without breaking any symmetry within each channel are quite promising as well. Necessity of Algorithm 2: In the case of unconditional generation, we observe a marked superiority in quality of the sampled reconstruction using Algorithm 2 over any other method considered. For example, in the broken symmetry case, the FID of the directly reconstructed images is 257.69 for CelebA and 214.24 for AFHQ, which are far worse than the scores of 49.45 and 54.68 from Table 5. In Figure 17, we also give a qualitative comparison of this difference. We can also clearly see from Figure 18 that Algorithm 1, the method used in Song et al. [2021b] and Ho et al. [2020], completely fails to produce an image close to the target data distribution. 18Figure 17: Comparison of direct reconstruction with sampling using Algorithm 2 for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry. Left-hand column is the initial cold images generated using the simple Gaussian model. Middle column has images generated in one step (i.e. direct reconstruction). Right-hand column are the images sampled with Algorithm 2. We present results for both CelebA (top) and AFHQ (bottom) with resolution 128 ×128. Figure 18: Comparison of Algorithm 1 (top row) and Algorithm 2 (bottom row) for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry on 128 ×128 CelebA dataset. We demonstrate that Algorithm 1 fails completely to generate a new image. 19Figure 19: Progressive deblurring of selected blurred MNIST and CIFAR-10 images. 20Figure 20: Progressive deblurring of selected blurred CelebA images. 21Figure 21: Deblurred Cifar10 images 22",

We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding non- linear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Interestingly, these linear denoisers are nearly optimal for multivariate Gaussian distributions defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset, and they effectively approximate the behavior of nonlinear diffusion models. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model’s capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case where the model is highly overpa- rameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models. 1 Introduction In recent years, diffusion models [1–4] have become one of the leading generative models, powering the state-of-the-art image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion [5]. To understand the empirical success of diffusion models, several works [6–12] have focused on their sampling behavior, showing that the data distribution can be effectively estimated in the reverse sampling process, assuming that the score function is learned accurately. Meanwhile, other works [ 13–18] investigate the learning of score functions, showing that effective approximation can be achieved with score matching loss under certain assumptions. However, these theoretical insights, grounded in simplified assumptions about data distribution and neural network architectures, do not fully capture the complex dynamics of diffusion models in practical scenarios. One significant discrepancy between theory and practice is that real-world diffusion models are trained only on a finite number of data points. As argued in [19], theoretically a perfectly learned score function over the empirical data distribution can only replicate the training data. In contrast, diffusion models trained on finite samples exhibit remarkable generalizability, producing high-quality images that significantly differ from the training examples. Therefore, a good understanding of the remarkable generative power of diffusion models is still lacking. In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of generalizability in diffusion models by analyzing the inherent properties of the learned score functions. Essentially, the score functions can be interpreted as a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. These denoisers are then 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2410.24060v5  [cs.LG]  2 Dec 2024chained together to progressively denoise a randomly sampled Gaussian noise into its corresponding clean image, thus, understanding the function mappings of these diffusion denoisers is critical to demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Motivated by the linearity observed in the diffusion denoisers of effectively generalized diffusion models, we propose to elucidate their function mappings with a linear distillation approach, where the resulting linear models serve as the linear approximations of their nonlinear counterparts. Contributions of this work: Our key findings can be highlighted as follows: • Inductive bias towards Gaussian structures (Section 3). Diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close (but not equal) to the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training data. This implies the diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training data for image generation. • Model Capacity and Training Duration (Section 4) We show that this inductive bias is most pronounced when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of the training data. However, even if the model is highly overparameterized, such inductive bias still emerges during early training phases, before the model memorizes its training data. This implies that early stopping can prompt generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. • Connection between Strong Generalization and Gaussian Structure (Section 5). Lastly, we argue that the recently observed strong generalization [20] results from diffusion models learning certain common low-dimensional structural features shared across non-overlapping datasets. We show that such low-dimensional features can be partially explained through the Gaussian structure. Relationship with Prior Arts. Recent research [20–24] demonstrates that diffusion models operate in two distinct regimes: ( i) a memorization regime, where models primarily reproduce training samples and (ii) a generalization regime, where models generate high-quality, novel images that extend beyond the training data. In the generalization regime, a particularly intriguing phenomenon is that diffusion models trained on non-overlapping datasets can generate nearly identical samples [20]. While prior work [20] attributes this ”strong generalization” effect to the structural inductive bias inherent in diffusion models leading to the optimal denoising basis (geometry-adaptive harmonic basis), our research advances this understanding by demonstrating diffusion models’ inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure of the training data. Our findings also corroborate with observations of earlier study [25] that the learned score functions of well-trained diffusion models closely align with the optimal score functions of a multivariate Gaussian approximation of the training data. 2 Preliminary Basics of Diffusion Models. Given a data distribution pdata(x), where x ∈ Rd, diffusion mod- els [1–4] define a series of intermediate states p(x; σ(t)) by adding Gaussian noise sampled from N(0, σ(t)2I) to the data, where σ(t) is a predefined schedule that specifies the noise level at time t ∈ [0, T], such that at the end stage the noise mollified distribution p(x; σ(T)) is indistinguishable from the pure Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, a new sample is generated by progressively denoising a random noise xT ∼ N(0, σ(T)2I) to its corresponding clean image x0. Following [4], this forward and backward diffusion process can be expressed with a probabilistic ODE: dx = −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇x log p(x; σ(t))dt. (1) In practice the score function ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) can be approximated by ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) = (Dθ(x; σ(t)) − x)/σ(t)2, (2) where Dθ(x; σ(t)) is parameterized by a deep network with parameters θ trained with the denoising score matching objective: min θ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I) \u0002 ∥Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − x∥2 2 \u0003 . (3) In the discrete setting, the reverse ODE in (1) takes the following form: xi+1 ← (1 − (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti))xi + (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti)Dθ(xi; σ(ti)), (4) 2where x0 ∼ N(0, σ2(t0)I). Notice that at each iteration i, the intermediate sample xi+1 is the sum of the scaled xi and the denoising output Dθ(xi; σ(ti)). Obviously, the final sampled image is largely determined by the denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)). If we can understand the function mapping of these diffusion denoisers, we can demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Optimal Diffusion Denoisers under Simplified Data Assumptions. Under certain assumptions on the data distribution pdata(x), the optimal diffusion denoisers Dθ(x; σ(t)) that minimize the score matching objective (3) can be derived analytically in closed-forms as we discuss below. • Multi-delta distribution of the training data. Suppose the training dataset contains a finite number of data points {y1, y2, ...,yN }, a natural way to model the data distribution is to represent it as a multi-delta distribution: p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi). In this case, the optimal denoiser is DM(x; σ(t)) = PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I)yi PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I) , (5) which is essentially a softmax-weighted combination of the finite data points. As proved in [24], such diffusion denoisers DM(x; σ(t)) can only generate exact replicas of the training samples, therefore they have no generalizability. • Multivariate Gaussian distribution. Recent work [ 25] suggests modeling the data distribution pdata(x) as a multivariate Gaussian distribution p(x) = N(µ, Σ), where the mean µ and the co- variance Σ are approximated by the empirical mean µ = 1 N PN i=1 yi and the empirical covariance Σ = 1 N PN i=1(yi − µ)(yi − µ)T of the training dataset. In this case, the optimal denoiser is: DG(x; σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), (6) where Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values Λ = diag (λ1, ··· , λd) and ˜Λσ(t) = diag \u0010 λ1 λ1+σ(t)2 , ··· , λd λd+σ(t)2 \u0011 . With this linear Gaus- sian denoiser, as proved in [25], the sampling trajectory of the probabilistic ODE (1) has close form: xt = µ + dX i=1 s σ(t)2 + λi σ(T)2 + λi uT i (xT − µ)ui, (7) where ui is the ith singular vector of the empirical covariance matrix. While [ 25] demonstrate that the Gaussian scores approximate learned scores at high noise variances, we show that they are nearly the best linear approximations of learned scores across a much wider range of noise variances. Generalization vs. Memorization of Diffusion Models. As the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images [17]. While memorization can be interpreted as an overfitting of diffusion models to the training samples, the mechanisms underlying the generalization regime remain less well understood. This study aims to explore and elucidate the inductive bias that enables effective generalization in diffusion models. 3 Hidden Linear and Gaussian Structures in Diffusion Models In this section, we study the intrinsic structures of the learned score functions of diffusion models in the generalization regime. Through various experiments and theoretical investigation, we show that Diffusion models in the generalization regime have inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structures of the dataset. Based on the linearity observed in diffusion denoisers trained in the generalization regime, we propose to investigate their intrinsic properties through a linear distillation technique, with which we train a series of linear models to approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers (Section 3.1). Interestingly, these linear models closely resemble the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset (Section 3.2). This implies diffusion models have the inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structure of the 3training dataset. We theoretically show that the observed Gaussian structure is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the constraint that the model is linear (Section 3.3). In the subsequent sections, although we mainly demonstrate our results using the FFHQ datasets, our findings are robust and extend to various architectures and datasets, as detailed in Appendix G. 3.1 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime Our study is motivated by the emerging linearity observed in diffusion models in the generalization regime. Specifically, we quantify the linearity of diffusion denoisers at various noise levelσ(t) by jointly assessing their ”Additivity” and ”Homogeneity” with a linearity score (LS) defined by the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)): LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , where x1, x2 ∼ p(x; σ(t)), and α ∈ R and β ∈ R are scalars. In practice, the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 samples. A more detailed discussion on this choice of measuring linearity is deferred to Appendix A. Figure 1: Linearity scores of diffusion denoisers. Solid and dashed lines depict the linearity scores across noise variances for models in the general- ization and memorization regimes, respectively, where α = β = 1/ √ 2. Following the EDM training configuration [4], we set the noise levels σ(t) within the contin- uous range [0.002,80]. As shown in Figure 1, as diffusion models transition from the mem- orization regime to the generalization regime (increasing the training dataset size), the corre- sponding diffusion denoisers Dθ exhibit increas- ing linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets1 as well as various training con- figurations2; see Appendix B for more details. This emerging linearity motivates us to ask the following questions: • To what extent can a diffusion model be ap- proximated by a linear model? • If diffusion models can be approximated lin- early, what are the underlying characteristics of this linear approximation? Investigating the Linear Structures via Linear Distillation. To address these questions, we investigate the hidden linear structure of diffusion denoisers through linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiserDθ(x; σ(t)) at noise levelσ(t), we approximate it with a linear function (with a bias term) such that: DL(x; σ(t)) := Wσ(t)x + bσ(t) ≈ Dθ(x; σ(t)), ∀x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), (8) where the weight Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d and bias bσ(t) ∈ Rd are learned by solving the following optimiza- tion problem with gradient descent:3 min Wσ(t),bσ(t) Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||Wσ(t)(x + ϵ) + bσ(t) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))||2 2. (9) If these linear models effectively approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers, analyzing their weights can elucidate the generation mechanism. While diffusion models are trained on continuous noise variance levels within [0.002,80], we examine the 10 discrete sampling steps specified by the EDM schedule [4]: [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002] . These steps are considered sufficient for studying the diffusion mappings for two reasons: (i) images generated using these 10 steps closely match those generated 1For example, FFHQ [26], CIFAR-10 [27], AFHQ [28] and LSUN-Churches [29]. 2For example, EDM-VE, EDM-VP and EDM-ADM. 3For the following, the input is the vectorized version of the noisy image and the expectation is approximated using finite samples of input-output pairs (xi + ϵi, Dθ(xi + ϵ, σ(t))) with i = 1, ..., N(see distillation details in Appendix C). 4Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) Figure 2: Score field approximation error and sampling Trajectory. The left and right figures demonstrate the score field approximation error and the sampling trajectories D(xt; σ(t) of actual diffusion model (EDM), Multi-Delta model, linear model and Gaussian model respectively. Notice that the curve corresponding to the Gaussian model almost overlaps with that of the linear model, suggesting they share similar funciton mappings. with more steps, and (ii) recent research [30] demonstrates that the diffusion denoisers trained on similar noise variances exhibit analogous function mappings, implying that denoiser behavior at discrete variances represents their behavior at nearby variances. After obtaining the linear modelsDL, we evaluate their differences with the actual nonlinear denoisers Dθ with the score field approximation error, calculated using the expectation over the root mean square error (RMSE): Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) r ∥DL(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))∥2 2 d| {z } RMSE of a pair of randomly sampled x and ϵ , (10) where d represents the data dimension and the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean. While we present RMSE-based results in the main text, our findings remain consistent across alternative metrics, including NMSE, as detailed in Appendix G. We perform linear distillation on well trained diffusion models operating in the generalization regime. For comprehensive analysis, we also compute the score approximation error between Dθ and: (i) the optimal denoisers for the multi-delta distribution DM defined as (5), and (ii) the optimal denoisers for the multivariate Gaussian distribution DG defined as (6). As shown in Figure 2, our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [20,80]. In this regime, only coarse image structures are generated (Fig- ure 2(right)). Quantitatively, as shown in Figure 2(left), the distilled linear model DL closely approximates its nonlinear counterpart Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. Both Gaussian score DG and multi-delta score DM also achieve comparable approximation accuracy. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, only subtle, imperceptible details are added to the generated images. Here, both DL and DG effectively approximate Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,20]: This crucial regime, where realistic image content is primarily generated, exhibits significant nonlinearity. While DM exhibits high approximation error due to rapid convergence to training samples—a memorization effect theoretically proved in [24], both DL and DG maintain relatively lower approximation errors. Qualitatively, as shown in Figure 2(right), despite the relatively high score approximation error in the intermediate noise regime, the images generated with DL closely resemble those generated with Dθ in terms of the overall image structure and certain amount of fine details. This implies (i) the underlying linear structure within the nonlinear diffusion models plays a pivotal role in their generalization capabilities and (ii) such linear structure is effectively captured by our distilled linear models. In the next section, we will explore this linear structure by examining the linear models DL. 3.2 Inductive Bias towards Learning the Gaussian Structures Notably, the Gaussian denoisers DG exhibit behavior strikingly similar to the linear denoisers DL. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), they achieve nearly identical score approximation errors, particularly 5Correlation Matrices !0123456 ! ‖\"!(#)−$\t&'!#$2‖&/‖$7Λ!#$2‖& Figure 4: Linear model shares similar function mapping with Gaussian model.

The right figure shows the correlation matrices between the first 100 singular vectors of the linear weights and Gaussian weights. in the critical intermediate variance region. Furthermore, their sampling trajectories are remarkably similar (Figure 2(right)), producing nearly identical generated images that closely match those from the actual diffusion denoisers (Figure 3). These observations suggest that DL and DG share similar function mappings across various noise levels, leading us to hypothesize that the intrinsic linear structure underlying diffusion models corresponds to the Gaussian structure of the training data—specifically, its empirical mean and covariance. We validate this hypothesis by empirically showing that DL is close to DG through the following three complementary experiments: • Similarity in weight matrices. As illustrated in Figure 4(left), Wσ(t) progressively converge towards U ˜Λσ(t)UT throughout the linear distillation process, achieving small normalized MSE (less than 0.2) for most of the noise levels. The less satisfactory convergence behavior at σ(t) = 80.0 is due to inadequate training of the diffusion models at this particular noise level, which is minimally sampled during the training of actual diffusion models (see Appendix G.2 for more details). Figure 3: Images sampled from vari- ous Models. The figure shows the sam- ples generated using different models starting from the same initial noises. • Similarity in Score functions. Furthermore, Figure 2(left, gray line) demonstrates that DL and DG maintain small score differences (RMSE less than 0.05) across all noise levels, indicating that these denoisers exhibit similar func- tion mappings throughout the diffusion process. • Similarity in principal components. As shown in Fig- ure 4(right), for a wide noise range (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0]), the leading singular vectors of the linear weights Wσ(t) (denoted ULinear) align well withU, the singular vectors of the Gaussian weights.4 This implies that U, representing the principal components of the training data, is effectively captured by the diffusion models. In the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]), however, Dθ approximates the identity mapping, leading to ambiguous singular vectors with minimal impact on image generation. Further analy- sis of Dθ’s behavior in the low-noise regime is provided in Appendices D and F.1. Since the optimization problem (9) is convex w.r.t. Wσ(t) and bσ(t), the optimal solution DL represents the unique optimal linear approximation of Dθ. Our analyses demonstrate that this optimal linear approximation closely aligns with DG, leading to our central finding: diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias (which we term as the Gaussian inductive bias) towards learning the Gaussian structure of training data. This manifests in two main ways: ( i) In the high-noise variance regime, well-trained diffusion models learn Dθ that closely approximate the linear Gaussian denoisers DG; (ii) As noise variance decreases, although Dθ diverges from DG, DG remains nearly identical to the optimal linear approximation DL, and images generated by DG retain structural similarity to those generated by Dθ. Finally, we emphasize that the Gaussian inductive bias only emerges in the generalization regime. By contrast, in the memorization regime, Figure 5 shows that DL significantly diverges from DG, and 4For σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0], the less well recovered singular vectors have singular values close to 0, whereas those corresponding to high singular values are well recovered. 6Clean Image!Noise\"∼.(/,&'#1)#=!+\" )!(\";&(')) )\"(\";&('))(70000))\"(\";&('))(35000))\"(\";&('))(1094))\"(\";&('))(68) )!(#;&(')) )\"(#;&('))(70000))\"(#;&('))(35000))\"(#;&('))(1094))\"(#;&('))(68) Denoising Outputs  for !\"=4 MemorizationGeneralization(a) (b) Figure 5: Comparison between the diffusion denoisers in memorization and generalization regimes. Figure(a) demonstrates that in the memorization regime (trained on small datasets of size 1094 and 68), DL significantly diverges from DG, and both provide substantially poorer approxima- tions of Dθ compared to the generalization regime (trained on larger datasets of size 35000 and 1094). Figure(b) qualitatively shows that the denoising outputs of Dθ closely match those of DG only in the generalization regime—a similarity that persists even when the denoisers process pure noise inputs. both DG and DL provide considerably poorer approximations of Dθ compared to the generalization regime. 3.3 Theoretical Analysis In this section, we demonstrate that imposing linear constraints on diffusion models while minimizing the denoising score matching objective (3) leads to the emergence of Gaussian structure. Theorem 1. Consider a diffusion denoiser parameterized as a single-layer linear network, defined as D(xt; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)xt + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is a linear weight matrix and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias vector. When the data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ, the optimal solution to the score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser defined in (6): DG(xt; σ(t)) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT (xt − µ) + µ, with Wσ(t) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT and bσ(t) = \u0010 I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT \u0011 µ. The detailed proof is postponed to Appendix E. This optimal solution corresponds to the classical Wiener filter [ 31], revealing that diffusion models naturally learn the Gaussian denoisers when constrained to linear architectures. To understand why highly nonlinear diffusion models operate near this linear regime, it is helpful to model the training data distribution as the multi-delta distribution p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi), where {y1, y2, ...,yN } is the finite training images. Notice that this formulation better reflects practical scenarios where only a finite number of training samples are available rather than the ground truth data distribution. Importantly, it is proved in [ 25] that the optimal denoisers DM in this case is approximately equivalent to DG for high noise variance σ(t) and query points far from the finite training data. This equivalence explains the strong similarity between DG and DM in the high-noise variance regime, and consequently, why Dθ and DG exhibit high similarity in this regime—deep networks converge to the optimal denoisers for finite training datasets. However, this equivalence betweenDG and DM breaks down at lower σ(t) values. The denoising outputs of DM are convex combinations of training data points, weighted by a softmax function with temperature σ(t)2. As σ(t)2 decreases, this softmax function increasingly approximates an argmax function, effectively retrieving the training point yi closest to the input x. Learning this optimal solution requires not only sufficient model capacity to memorize the entire training dataset but also, as shown in [32], an exponentially large number of training samples. Due to these learning challenges, deep networks instead converge to local minimaDθ that, while differing fromDM, exhibit better generalization property. Our experiments reveal that these learned Dθ share similar function mappings with DG. The precise mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question for future research. 7MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 6: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structure when training dataset is large. Models with a fixed scale (channel size 128) are trained across various dataset sizes. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. ”NN” denotes the nearest neighbor in the training dataset to the images generated by the diffusion models. Notably, modeling pdata(x) as a multi-delta distribution reveals a key insight: while unconstrained optimal denoisers (5) perfectly capture the scores of the empirical distribution, they have no gen- eralizability. In contrast, Gaussian denoisers, despite having higher score approximation errors due to the linear constraint, can generate novel images that closely match those produced by the actual diffusion models. This suggests that the generative power of diffusion models stems from the imperfect learning of the score functions of the empirical distribution. 4 Conditions for the Emergence of Gaussian Structures and Generalizability In Section 3, we demonstrate that diffusion models exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers that are close to the Gaussian denoisers. In this section, we investigate the conditions under which this bias manifests. Our findings reveal that this inductive bias is linked to model generalization and is governed by (i) the model capacity relative to the dataset size and (ii) the training duration. For additional results, including experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, see Appendix F. 4.1 Gaussian Structures Emerge when Model Capacity is Relatively Small First, we find that the Gaussian inductive bias and the generalization of diffusion models are heavily influenced by the relative size of the model capacity compared to the training dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of training dataset. This argument is supported by the following two key observations: • Increasing dataset size prompts the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed model scale. We train diffusion models using the EDM configuration [4] with a fixed channel size of 128 on datasets of varying sizes [68, 137, 1094, 8750, 35000, 70000] until FID convergence. Figure 6(left) demonstrates that the score approximation error between diffusion denoisers Dθ and Gaussian denoisers DG decreases as the training dataset size grows, particularly in the crucial intermediate noise variance regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]). This increasing similarity between Dθ and DG correlates with a transition in the models’ behavior: from a memorization regime, where generated images are replicas of training samples, to a generalization regime, where novel images exhibiting Gaussian structure5 are produced, as shown in Figure 6(b). This correlation underscores the critical role of Gaussian structure in the generalization capabilities of diffusion models. • Decreasing model capacity promotes the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed dataset sizes. Next, we investigate the impact of model scale by training diffusion models with varying channel sizes [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], corresponding to[64k, 251k, 992k, 4M, 16M, 64M] parameters, on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. Figure 7(left) shows that in the intermediate noise variance regime 5We use the term ”exhibiting Gaussian structure” to describe images that resemble those generated by Gaussian denoisers. 8GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 7: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure when model scale is small. Models with different scales are trained on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 8: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Diffusion model with same scale (channel size 128) is trained using 1094 images. The left and right figures shows the score difference and the generated images respectively. (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]), the discrepancy between Dθ and DG decreases with decreasing model scale, indicating that Gaussian structure emerges in low-capacity models. Figure 7(right) demonstrates that this trend corresponds to a transition from data memorization to the generation of images exhibiting Gaussian structure. Here we note that smaller models lead to larger discrepancy between Dθ and DG in the high-noise regime. This phenomenon arises because diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances, especially when model capacity is limited (see more details in Appendix F.2). These two experiments collectively suggest that the inductive bias of diffusion models is governed by the relative capacity of the model compared to the training dataset size. 4.2 Overparameterized Models Learn Gaussian Structures before Memorization In the overparameterized regime, where model capacity significantly exceeds training dataset size, diffusion models eventually memorize the training data when trained to convergence. However, examining the learning progression reveals a key insight: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures with generalizability before they memorize. Figure 8(a) demonstrates that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ progressively converge to DG in the intermediate noise variance regime, indicating that the diffusion model is progressively learning the Gaussian structure in the initial stages of training. Notably. By epoch 841, the diffusion model generates images strongly resembling those produced by the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 8(b). However, continued training beyond this point increases the difference between Dθ and DG as the model transitions toward memorization. This observation suggests that early stopping could be an effective strategy for promoting generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. 9Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 35000, model scale 128 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 35000) Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 1094) Non-overlapping datasets with size 1094, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 8 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (1094) Figure 9: Diffusion models in the strong generalization regime generate similar images as the Gaussian models.

Figure(c): Early stopping and reducing model capacity help transition diffusion models from memorization to generalization. 5 Connection between Strong Generalizability and Gaussian Structure A recent study [ 20] reveals an intriguing ”strong generalization” phenomenon: diffusion models trained on large, non-overlapping image datasets generate nearly identical images from the same initial noise. While this phenomenon might be attributed to deep networks’ inductive bias towards learning the ”true” continuous distribution of photographic images, we propose an alternative explanation: rather than learning the complete distribution, deep networks may capture certain low-dimensional common structural features shared across these datasets and these features can be partially explained by the Gaussian structure. To validate this hypothesis, we examine two diffusion models with channel size 128, trained on non-overlapping datasets S1 and S2 (35000 images each). Figure 9(a) shows that images generated by these models (bottom) closely match those from their corresponding Gaussian models (top), highlighting the Gaussian structure’s role in strong generalization. Comparing Figure 9(a)(top) and (b)(top), we observe that DG generates nearly identical images whether the Gaussian structure is calculated on a small dataset (1094 images) or a much larger one (35000 images). This similarity emerges because datasets of the same class can exhibit similar Gaussian structure (empirical covariance) with relatively few samples—just hundreds for FFHQ. Given the Gaussian structure’s critical role in generalization, small datasets may already contain much of the information needed for generalization, contrasting previous assertions in [20] that strong generalization requires training on datasets of substantial size (more than 105 images). However, smaller datasets increase memorization risk, as shown in Figure 9(b). To mitigate this, as discussed in Section 4, we can either reduce model capacity or implement early stopping (Figure 9(c)). Indeed, models trained on 1094 and 35000 images generate remarkably similar images, though the smaller dataset yields lower perceptual quality. This similarity further demonstrates that small datasets contain substantial generalization-relevant information closely tied to Gaussian structure. Further discussion on the connections and differences between our work and [20] are detailed in Appendix H. 6 Discussion In this study, we empirically demonstrate that diffusion models in the generalization regime have the inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close to the corresponding linear Gaussian denoisers. Although real-world image distributions are significantly different from Gaussian, our findings imply that diffusion models have the bias towards learning and utilizing low-dimensional data structures, such as the data covariance, for image generation. However, the underlying mechanism by which the nonlinear diffusion models, trained with gradient descent, exhibit such linearity remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Moreover, the Gaussian structure only partially explains diffusion models’ generalizability. While models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, a substan- tial gap persists between the linear Gaussian denoisers and the actual nonlinear diffusion models, especially in the intermediate noise regime. As a result, images generated by Gaussian denoisers fall 10short in perceptual quality compared to those generated by the actual diffusion models especially for complex dataset such as CIFAR-10.

For a diffusion denoiser, Dθ(x; σ(t)), to be considered approximately linear, it must fulfill the following conditions: • Additivity: The function should satisfy Dθ(x1 + x2; σ(t)) ≈ Dθ(x1; σ(t)) + Dθ(x2; σ(t)). • Homogeneity: It should also adhere to Dθ(αx; σ(t)) ≈ αDθ(x; σ(t)). To jointly assess these properties, we propose to measure the difference betweenDθ(αx1+βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)). While the linearity score is introduced as the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)) in the main text: LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , (11) it can also be defined with the normalized mean square difference (NMSE): Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) − (αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)))||2 ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))||2 , (12) where the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 randomly sampled pairs of (x1, x2). In the next section, we will demonstrate the linearity score with both metrics. Since the diffusion denoisers are trained solely on inputs x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), their behaviors on out- of-distribution inputs can be quite irregular. To produce a denoised output with meaningful image structure, it is critical that the noise component in the input x matches the correct variance σ(t)2. Therefore, our analysis of linearity is restricted to in-distribution inputs x1 and x2, which are randomly sampled images with additive Gaussian noises calibrated to noise variance σ(t)2. We also need to ensure that the values of α and β are chosen such that α2 + β2 = 1, maintaining the correct variance for the noise term in the combined input αx1 + βx2. We present the linearity scores, calculated with varying values of α and β, for diffusion models trained on diverse datasets in Figure 10. These models are trained with the EDM-VE configuration proposed in [4], which ensures the resulting models are in the generalization regime. Typically, setting α = β = 1/ √ 2 yields the lowest linearity score; however, even in this scenario, the cosine similarity remains impressively high, exceeding 0.96. This high value underscores the presence of significant linearity within diffusion denoisers. We would like to emphasize that for linearity to manifest in diffusion denoisers, it is crucial that they are well-trained, achieving a low denoising score matching loss as indicated in (3). As shown in Figure 11, the linearity notably reduces in a less well trained diffusion model (Baseline-VE) comapred to its well-trained counterpart (EDM-VE). Although both models utilize the same ’VE’ network architecture Fθ(x; σ(t)) [2], they differ in how the diffusion denoisers are parameterized: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), (13) 15where cskip is the skip connection and cout modulate the scale of the network output. With carefully tailored cskip and cout, the EDM-VE configuration achieves a lower score matching loss compared to Baseline-VE, resulting in samples with higher quality as illustrated in Figure 11(right). B Emerging Linearity of Diffusion Models In this section we provide a detailed discussion on the observation that diffusion models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, which is briefly described in Section 3.1. B.1 Generalization and Memorization Regimes of Diffusion Models As shown in Figure 12, as the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images. To measure the generalization capabilities of diffusion models, it is crucial to assess their ability to generate images that are not mere replications of the training dataset. This can be quantitatively evaluated by generating a large set of images from the diffusion model and measuring the average difference between these generated images and their nearest neighbors in the training set. Specifically, let {x1, x2, ...,xk} represent k randomly sampled images from the diffusion models (we choose k = 100 in our experiments), and let Y := {y1, y2, ...,yN } denote the training dataset consisting of N images. We define the generalization score as follows: GL Score := 1 k kX i=1 ||xi − NNY (xi)||2 ||xi||2 (14) where NNY (xi) represents the nearest neighbor of the samplexk in the training datasetY , determined by the Euclidean distance on a per-pixel basis. Empirically, a GL score exceeding 0.6 indicates that the diffusion models are effectively generalizing beyond the training dataset. B.2 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime As demonstrated in Figure 13(a) and (d), diffusion models transition from the memorization regime to the generalization regime as the training dataset size increases. Concurrently, as depicted in Fig- ure 13(b), (c), (e) and (f), the corresponding diffusion denoisers exhibit increasingly linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets datasets including FFHQ [26], AFHQ [28] and LSUN- Churches [29], as well as various model architectures including EDM-VE [ 3], EDM-VP [2] and EDM-ADM [34]. This emerging linearity implies that the hidden linear structure plays an important role in the generalizability of diffusion model. C Linear Distillation As discussed in Section 3.1, we propose to study the hidden linearity observed in diffusion denosiers with linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)), we aim to approxi- Figure 10: Linearity scores for varying α and β. The diffusion models are trained with the edm-ve configuration [4], which ensures the models are in the generalization regime. 16Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models ((*!;,(-)) Figure 11: Linearity scores and sampling trajectory.

Notice that for three dimensional images with size (c, h, w), x ∈ Rd represents their vectorized version, where d = c × w × h.

Addi- tionally, we employ the Adam optimizer [35] for updates. Additional linear distillation results are provided in Figure 14. 17FFHQ CIFAR-10(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 13: Diffusion model exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization. Figure(a) and (d) demonstrate that for both FFHQ and CIFAR-10 datasets, the generalization score increases with the training dataset size, indicating progressive model generaliza- tion. Figure(b), (c), (e), and (f) show that this transition towards generalization is accompanied by increasing denoiser linearity. Specifically, Figure(b) and (e) display linearity scores calculated using cosine similarity (11), while Figure(c) and (f) show scores computed using NMSE (12). Both metrics reveal consistent trends. D Diffusion Models in Low-noise Regime are Approximately Linear Mapping It should be noted that the low score difference between DG and Dθ within the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]) does not imply the diffusion denoisers capture the Gaussian structure, instead, the similarity arises since both of them are converging to the identity mapping as σ(t) decreases. As shown in Figure 15, within this regime, the differences between the noisy input x and their corresponding denoised outputs Dθ(x; σ(t)) quickly approach 0. This indicates that the learned denoisers Dθ progressively converge to the identity function. Additionally, from (6), it is evident that the difference between the Gaussian weights and the identity matrix diminishes as σ(t) decreases, which explains why DG can well approximate Dθ in the low noise variance regime. We hypothesize that Dθ learns the identity function because of the following two reasons: (i) within the low-noise regime, since the added noise is negligible compared to the clean image, the identity function already achieves a small denoising error, thus serving as a shortcut which is exploited by the deep network. (ii) As discussed in Appendix A, diffusion models are typically parameterized as follows: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), where Fθ represents the deep network, and cskip(σ(t)) and cout(σ(t)) are adaptive parameters for the skip connection and output scaling, respectively, which adjust according to the noise variance levels. For canonical works on diffusion models [2–4, 34], as σ(t) approaches zero, cskip and cout converge to 1 and 0 respectively. Consequently, at low variance levels, the function forms of diffusion denoisers are approximatly identity mapping: Dθ(x; σ(t)) ≈ x. This convergence to identity mapping has several implications. First, the weights Wσ(t) of the distilled linear models DL approach the identity matrix at low variances, leading to ambiguous 18Algorithm 1 Linear Distillation Require: (i) the targeted diffusion denoiser Dθ(·; σ(t)), (ii) weights Wσ(t) and biases bσ(t), both initialized to zero, (iii) gradient step size η, (iv) number of training iterations K, (v) training batch size n, (vi) image dataset S. for k = 1 to K do Randomly sample a batch of training images {x1, x2, . . . ,xn} from S.

Figure(a) demonstrates the gradual symmetrization of linear weights during the distillation process. Figure(b) shows that at convergence, the singular values of the linear weights closely match those of the Gaussian weights. Figure(c) and Figure(d) display the leading singular vectors of both linear and Gaussian weights at σ(t) = 4 for FFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets, respectively, revealing a strong correlation. singular vectors. This explains the poor recovery of singular vectors for σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116] shown in Figure 4. Second, the presence of the bias term in (8) makes it challenging for our linear model to learn the identity function, resulting in large errors at σ(t) = 0.002 as shown in Figure 4(a). Finally, from (4), we observe that when Dθ acts as an identity mapping, xi+1 remains unchanged from xi. This implies that sampling steps in low-variance regions minimally affect the generated image content, as confirmed in Figure 2, where image content shows negligible variation during these steps. 19Normalized MSE between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙  Cosine Similarity between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙   (b)(a)  (c) (d) Figure 15: Difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x for various noise variance levels. Figures(a) and (c) show the differences between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x across σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 80], measured by normalized MSE and cosine similarity, respectively. Figures(b) and (d) provide zoomed-in views of (a) and (c). The diffusion models were trained on the FFHQ dataset. Notice that the difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x quickly converges to near zero in the low noise variance regime. The trend is consistent for various model architectures. E Theoretical Analysis E.1 Proof of Theorem 1 In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1 (Section 3.3). Our theorem is based on the following two assumptions: Assumption 1. Suppose that the diffusion denoisers are parameterized as single-layer linear net- works, defined as D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is the linear weight and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias. Assumption 2. The data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ Theorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser: DG(x, σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), where Σ = UΛUT represents the SVD of the covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,d} and ˜Λσ(t) = diag[ λk λk+σ(t)2 ]. Furthermore, this optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. To proveTheorem 1, we first show that the Gaussian denoiser is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the linear network constraint. Then we will show that such optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. The Global Optimal Solution. Under the constraint that the diffusion denoiser is restricted to a single-layer linear network with bias: D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), (15) We get the following optimizaiton problem from Equation (3): W⋆, b⋆ = arg min W,b L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2, (16) where we omit the footnote σ(t) in Wσ(t) and bσ(t) for simplicity. Since expectation preserves convexity, the optimization problem Equation (16) is a convex optimization problem. To find the global optimum, we first eliminate b by requiring the partial derivative ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) to be 0. Since ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)((W − I)x + Wϵ + b) (17) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata ((W − I)x + b) (18) = 2 ∗ ((W − I)µ + b), (19) we have b⋆ = (I − W∗)µ. (20) 20Utilizing the expression for b, we get the following equivalent form of the optimization problem: W⋆ = arg min W L(W; σ(t)) := 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x − µ + ϵ) − (x − µ)||2 2. (21) The derivative ∇W L(W; σ(t)) is: ∇W L(W; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ ExEϵ(W(x − µ + ϵ)(x − µ + ϵ)T − (x − µ)(x − µ + ϵ)T ) (22) = 2 ∗ Ex((W − I)(x − µ)(x − µ)T + σ(t)2W) (23) = 2 ∗ W(Σ + σ(t)2I) − 2 ∗ Σ. (24) Suppose Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,n}, by setting ∇W L(W; σ(t)) to 0, we get the optimal solution: W⋆ = UΛUT U(Λ + σ(t)2I)−1UT (25) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT , (26) where ˜Λσ(t)[i, i] = λi λi+σ(t)2 and λi = Λ[i, i]. Substitute W⋆ back to Equation (20), we have: b⋆ = (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (27) Notice that the expression for W⋆ and b⋆ is exactly the Gaussian denoiser. Next, we will show this optimal solution can be achieved with gradient descent. Gradient Descent Recovers the Optimal Solution. Consider minimizing the population loss: L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2. (28) Define ˜W := [W b ], ˜x := \u0014 x 1 \u0015 and ˜ϵ = \u0014 ϵ 0 \u0015 , then we can rewrite Equation (28) as: L( ˜W; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)|| ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ) − x||2 2. (29) We can compute the gradient in terms of ˜W as: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ)(˜x + ˜ϵ)T − x(˜x + ˜ϵ)T ) (30) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x˜xT + ˜x˜ϵT + ˜ϵ˜xT + ˜ϵ˜ϵT ) − x˜xT − x˜ϵT ). (31) Since Eϵ(˜ϵ) = 0 and Eϵ(˜ϵ˜ϵT ) = \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex( ˜W(˜x˜xT + \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 ) − x˜xT ). (32) Since E(˜x˜xT ) = \u0014 E(xxT ) E(x) E(xT ) 1 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ˜W \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 − 2 \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 . (33) With learning rate η, we can write the update rule as: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 ) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 (34) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2ηA) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 , (35) where we define A := I − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 for simplicity. By recursively expanding the expression for ˜W, we have: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(0)At+1 + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 tX i=0 Ai. (36) 21Notice that there exists a η, such that every eigen value of A is smaller than 1 and greater than 0. In this case, At+1 → 0 as t → ∞. Similarly, by the property of matrix geometric series, we havePt i=0 Ai → (I − A)−1. Therefore we have: ˜W → \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ uT 1 \u0015−1 (37) = \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 , (38) where we define B := Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I for simplicity. By the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula, we have: \u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 = \u0014 (B − µµT )−1 −(B − µµT )−1µ −(1 − µT B−1µ)−1µT B−1 (1 − µT B−1µ)−1 \u0015 . (39) Therefore, we have: ˜W → h Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1−µT B−1µ −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1−µT B−1µ i , (40) from which we have W → Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ (41) b → −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1 − µT B−1µ (42) Since Ex[xxT ] = Ex[(x − µ)((x − µ)T ] + µµT , we have: W = Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 + µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ. (43) Applying Sherman-Morrison Formula, we have: (B − µµT )−1 = B−1 + B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ , (44) therefore µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ = µµT B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ − µµT B−1µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ (45) = µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ(µµT B−1 − µµT B−1) (46) = 0 (47) , which implies W → Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 (48) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT . (49) Similarly, we have: b → (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (50) Therefore, gradient descent with a properly chosen learning rate η recovers the Gaussian Denoisers when time goes to infinity. E.2 Two Extreme Cases Our empirical results indicate that the best linear approximation of Dθ is approximately equivalent to DG. According to the orthogonality principle [36], this requires Dθ to satisfy: Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I){(Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − (x − µ))(x + ϵ − µ)T } ≈0. (51) Notice that (51) does not hold for general denoisers. Two extreme cases for this to hold are: 22• Case 1: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ x for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). • Case 2: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ DG(x + ϵ; σ(t)) for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). Case 1 requires Dθ(x+ϵ; σ(t)) to be the oracle denoiser that perfectly recover the ground truth clean image, which never happens in practice except when σ(t) becomes extremely small. Instead, our empirical results suggest diffusion models in the generalization regime bias towards Case 2, where deep networks learn Dθ that approximate (not equal) to DG. This is evidenced in Figure 5(b), where diffusion models trained on larger datasets (35000 and 7000 images) produce denoising outputs similar to DG. Notice that this similarity holds even when the denoisers take pure Gaussian noise as input. The exact mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question and we leave it as future work. F More Discussion on Section 4 While in Section 4 we mainly focus on the discussion of the behavior of diffusion denoisers in the intermediate-noise regime, in this section we study the denoiser dynamics in both low and high-noise regime. We also provide additional experiment results on CIFAR-10 dataset. F.1 Behaviors in Low-noise Regime We visualize the score differences between DG and Dθ in low-noise regime in Figure 16. The left figure demonstrates that when the dataset size becomes smaller than a certain threshold, the score difference at σ = 0 remains persistently non-zero. Moreover, the right figure shows that this difference depends solely on dataset size rather than model capacity. This phenomenon arises from two key factors: (i) Dθ converges to the identity mapping at low noise levels, independent of training dataset size and model capacity, and (ii) DG approximates the identity mapping at low noise levels only when the empirical covariance matrix is full-rank, as can be seen from (6). Since the rank of the covariance matrix is upper-bounded by the training dataset size, DG differs from the identity mapping when the dataset size is smaller than the data dimension. This creates a persistent gap between DG and Dθ, with smaller datasets leading to lower rank and consequently larger score differences. These observations align with our discussion in Appendix D. F.2 Behaviors in High-noise Regime As shown in Figure 7(a), while a decreased model scale pushes Dθ in the intermediate noise region towards DG, their differences enlarges in the high noise variance regime. This phenomenon arises be- cause diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances. A shown in Figure 17, for high σ(t), Dθ converge to DG when trained with sufficient model capacity (Figure 17(b)) and training time (Figure 17(c)). This behavior is consistent irrespective of the training dataset sizes (Figure 17(a)). Convergence in the high-noise variance regime is less crucial in practice, since diffusion steps in Figure 16: Score differences for low-noise variances. The left and right figures are the zoomed-in views of Figure 6(a) and Figure 7(a) respectively. Notice that when the dataset size is smaller than the dimension of the image, the score differences are always non-zero at σ = 0. 23Denoising Outputs  for 𝜎𝑡=60 (PSNR = -29.5 dB)Effect of Model Scale (1094 training images) Effect of Training Epochs (1094 training images) Effect of Dataset Size𝒚=𝒙+𝜎𝑡∗𝝐 𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(4)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(8)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(128) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(187)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(841)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(9173)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64210) (a) (b) (c) Figure 17: Dθ converge to DG with no overfitting for high noise variances.

All models are trained on a fixed dataset of 1,094 images. this regime contribute substantially less than those in the intermediate-noise variance regime—a phenomenon we analyze further in Appendix G.5. F.3 Similarity between Diffusion Denoiers and Gaussian Denoisers In Section 4, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent in models with limited capacity and during early training stages, a finding qualitatively validated in Figure 18. Specifically, Figure 18(b) shows that larger models (channel sizes 128 and 64) tend to memorize, 24MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 19: Large dataset size prompts the Gaussian structure. Models with the same scale (channel size 64) are trained on CIFAR-10 datasets with varying sizes.

GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 20: Smaller model scale prompts the Gaussian structure. Models with varying scales are trained on a fixed CIFAR-10 datasets with 782 images. Figure(a) shows that smaller model scale leads to increased similarity between DG and Dθ in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, smaller scale leads to larger score differences in high-noise regime due to insufficient training from limited model capacity. directly retrieving training data as denoising outputs. In contrast, smaller models (channel sizes 8 and 4) exhibit behavior similar to DG, producing comparable denoising outputs. Similarly, Figure 18(c) reveals that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ outputs progressively align with those of DG. However, extended training beyond this point leads to memorization. F.4 CIFAR-10 Results The effects of model capacity and training duration on the Gaussian inductive bias, as demonstrated in Figures 19 to 21, extend to the CIFAR-10 dataset. These results confirm our findings from Section 4: the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent when model scale and training duration are limited. G Additional Experiment Results While in the main text we mainly demonstrate our findings using EDM-VE diffusion models trained on FFHQ, in this section we show our results are robust and extend to various model architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models, but it is a fundamental property of denoising autoencoders [37]. Lastly, we verify that our 25GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 21: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Models with the same scale (channel size 128) are trained on a fixed CIFAR-10 datasets with 782 images. Figure(a) shows that the similarity between DG and Dθ progressively increases during early training epochs (0-921) in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, continue training beyond this point results in divergedDG and Dθ, resulting in memorization.

Figures(a), (b) and (c) correspond to diffusion models trained on FFHQ, with EDM-VE, EDM-ADM and EDM-VP network architectures specified in [4] respectively. conclusions remain consistent when using alternative metrics such as NMSE instead of the RMSE used in the main text. G.1 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various Network Architectures We first demonstrate that diffusion models capture the Gaussian structure of the training dataset, irrespective of the deep network architectures used. As shown in Figure 22 (a), (b), and (c), although the actual diffusion models, Dθ, are parameterized with different architectures, for all noise variances except σ(t) ∈ {0.002, 80.0}, their corresponding linear models, DL, consistently converge towards the common Gaussian models, DG, determined by the training dataset. Qualitatively, as depicted in Figure 23, despite variations in network architectures, diffusion models generate nearly identical images, matching those generated from the Gaussian models. G.2 Gaussian Inductive Bias as a General Property of DAEs In previous sections, we explored the properties of diffusion models by interpreting them as collections of deep denoisers, which are equivalent to the denoising autoencoders (DAEs) [37] trained on various noise variances by minimizing the denoising score matching objective(3). Although diffusion models and DAEs are equivalent in the sense that both of them are trying to learn the score function of the 26Figure 23: Images sampled from various model. The figure shows the sampled images from diffusion models with different network architectures and those from their corresponding Gaussian models. noise-mollified data distribution [38], the training objective of diffusion models is more complex [4]: min θ Ex,ϵ,σ[λ(σ)cout(σ)2||Fθ(x + ϵ, σ) − 1 cout(σ)(x − cskip(σ)(x + ϵ)) | {z } linear combination of x and ϵ ||2 2], (52) where x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I) and σ ∼ ptrain. Notice that the training objective of diffusion models has a few distinct characteristics: • Diffusion models use a single deep network Fθ to perform denoising score matching across all noise variances while DAEs are typically trained separately for each noise level. • Diffusion models are not trained uniformly across all noise variances. Instead, during training the probability of sampling a given noise level σ is controlled by a predefined distribution ptrain and the loss is weighted by λ(σ). • Diffusion models often utilize special parameterizations (13). Therefore, the deep network Fθ is trained to predict a linear combination of the clean image x and the noise ϵ, whereas DAEs typically predict the clean image directly. Given these differences, we investigate whether the Gaussian inductive bias is unique to diffusion models or a general characteristic of DAEs. To this end, we train separate DAEs (deep denoisers) using the vanilla denoising score matching objective (3) on each of the 10 discrete noise variances specified by the EDM schedule [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002], and compare the score differences between them and the corresponding Gaussian denoisers DG. We use no special parameterization so that Dθ = Fθ; that is, the deep network directly predicts the clean image. Furthermore, the DAEs for each noise variance are trained till convergence, ensuring all noise levels are trained sufficiently. We consider the following architectural choices: • DAE-NCSN: In this setting, the network Fθ uses the NCSN architecture [3], the same as that used in the EDM-VE diffusion model. • DAE-Skip: In this setting, Fθ is a U-Net [ 39] consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization [40], leaky ReLU activation [41] and convolutional skip connections. We refer to this network as ”Skip-Net”. Compared to NCSN, which adapts the state of the art architecture designs, Skip-Net is deliberately constructed to be as simple as possible to test how architectural complexity affects the Gaussian inductive bias. • DAE-DiT: In this setting, Fθ is a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) introduced in [42]. Vision Transformers are known to lack inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance that are inherent to convolutional models [43]. Here we are interested in if this affects the Gaussian inductive bias. 27Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) (a) (b) Figure 24: Comparison between DAEs and diffusion models. Figure(a) compares the score field approximation error between Gaussian models and both (i) diffusion models (EDM vs. Gaussian) and (ii) DAEs with varying architectures. Figure(b) illustrates the generation trajectories of different models initialized from the same noise input. • DAE-Linear: In this setting we set Fθ to be a linear model with a bias term as in (8). According to Theorem 1, these models should converge to Gaussian denoisers. The quantitative results are shown in Figure 24(a). First, the DAE-linear models well approximateDG across all 10 discrete steps (RMSE smaller than 0.04), consistent with Theorem 1. Second, despite the differences between diffusion models (EDM) and DAEs, they achieve similar score approximation errors relative to DG for most noise variances, meaning that they can be similarly approximated by DG. However, diffusion models exhibit significantly larger deviations fromDG at higher noise variances (σ ∈ {42.415, 80.0}) since they utilize a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution ptrain that emphasizes training on intermediate noise levels, leading to under-training at high noise variances. Lastly, the DAEs with different architectures achieve comparable score approximation errors, and both DAEs and diffusion models generate images matching those from the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 24(b). These findings demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models or specific architectures but is a fundamental property of DAEs. G.3 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various datasets As illustrated in Figure 25, for diffusion models trained on the CIFAR-10, AFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets that are in the generalization regime, their generated samples match those produced by the corresponding Gaussian models. Additionally, their linear approximations, DL, obtained through linear distillation, align closely with the Gaussian models, DG, resulting in nearly identical generated images. These findings confirm that the Gaussian structure is prevalent across various datasets. G.4 Strong Generalization on CIFAR-10 Figure 26 demonstrates the strong generalization effect on CIFAR-10. Similar to the observations in Section 5, reducing model capacity or early stopping the training process prompts the Gaussian inductive bias, leading to generalization. G.5 Measuring Score Approximation Error with NMSE While in Section 3.1 we define the score field approximation error between denoisers D1 and D2 with RMSE ( (10)), this error can also be quantified using NMSE: Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) ||D1(x + ϵ) − D2(x + ϵ)||2 ||D1(x + ϵ)||2 . (53) As shown in Figure 27, while the trend in intermediate-noise and low-noise regimes remains unchanged, NMSE amplifies differences in the high-noise variance regime compared to RMSE. This amplified score difference between DG and Dθ does not contradict our main finding that diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers 28Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated Samples Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated SamplesLSUN-Churches AFHQ(a) (b) (c) (d) Final Generated SamplesCIFAR- 10Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) image 1image 2image 3image 4image 5 (e) (f) Figure 25: Final generated images and sampling trajectories for various models.

Figures(b), (d) and (f) demonstrate the corresponding sampling trajectories. approximately equivalent to DG in the high-noise variance regime. As discussed in Section 3.2 and appendices F.2 and G.2, this large score difference stems from inadequate training in this regime. Figure 27 (Gaussian vs. DAE) demonstrates that when DAEs are sufficiently trained at specific noise variances, they still converge to DG. Importantly, the insufficient training in the high-noise variance regime minimally affects final generation quality. Figure 25(f) shows that while the diffusion model (EDM) produces noisy trajectories at early timesteps ( σ ∈ {80.0, 42.415}), these artifacts quickly disappear in later stages, indicating that the Gaussian inductive bias is most influential in the intermediate-noise variance regime. Notably, even when Dθ are inadequately trained in the high-noise variance regime, they remain approximable by linear functions, though these functions no longer match DG. 29Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 25000, model scale 64 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 25000)Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 782) Non-overlapping datasets with size 782, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 4 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (782) Figure 26: Strong generalization on CIFAR-10 dataset.

H Discussion on Geometry-Adaptive Harmonic Bases H.1 GAHB only Partially Explain the Strong Generalization Recent work [20] observes that diffusion models trained on sufficiently large non-overlapping datasets (of the same class) generate nearly identical images. They explain this ”strong generalization” phenomenon by analyzing bias-free deep diffusion denoisers with piecewise linear input-output 30mappings: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))x (54) = X k λk(xt)uk(xt)vT k (xt)xt, (55) where λk(xt), uk(xt), and vk(xt) represent the input-dependent singular values, left and right singular vectors of the network Jacobian ∇D(xt; σ(t)). Under this framework, strong generalization occurs when two denoisers D1 and D2 have similar Jacobians: ∇D1(xt; σ(t)) ≈ ∇D2(xt; σ(t)). The authors conjecture this similarity arises from networks’ inductive bias towards learning certain optimal ∇D(xt; σ(t)) that has sparse singular values and the singular vectors of which are the geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHB)—near-optimal denoising bases that adapt to input xt. While [20] provides valuable insights, their bias-free assumption does not reflect real-world diffusion models, which inherently contain bias terms. For feed forward ReLU networks, the denoisers are piecewise affine: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))xt + bxt, (56) where bxt is the network bias that depends on both network parameterization and the noisy input xt [44]. Here, similar Jacobians alone cannot explain strong generalization, as networks may differ significantly in bxt. For more complex network architectures where even piecewise affinity fails, we consider the local linear expansion of D(xt; σ(t)): D(xt + ∆x; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))∆xt + D(xt; σ(t)), (57) which approximately holds for small perturbation ∆x. Thus, although ∇D(xt; σ(t)) characterizes D(xt; σ(t))’s local behavior around xt, it does not provide sufficient information on the global properties. Our work instead examines global behavior, demonstrating that D(xt; σ(t)) is close to DG(xt; σ(t))—the optimal linear denoiser under the Gaussian data assumption. This implies that strong generalization partially stems from networks learning similar Gaussian structures across non-overlapping datasets of the same class. Since our linear model captures global properties but not local characteristics, it complements the local analysis in [20]. H.2 GAHB Emerge only in Intermediate-Noise Regime For completeness, we study the evolution of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across various noise levels σ(t). The results are presented in Figures 28 and 29, which reveal three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [10,80]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors6 of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) well align with those of the Gaussian weights (the leading principal components of the training dataset), consistent with our finding that diffusion denoisers approximate linear Gaussian denoisers in this regime. Notice that DAEs trained sufficiently on separate noise levels (Figure 29) show stronger alignment compared to vanilla diffusion models (Figure 28), which suffer from insufficient training at high noise levels. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,10]: In this regime, GAHB emerge as singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) diverge from the principal components, becoming increasingly adaptive to the geometry of input image. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) show no clear patterns, consistent with our observation that diffusion denoisers approach the identical mapping, which has unconstrained singular vectors. Notice that the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) are the input directions that lead to the maximum variation in denoised outputs, thus revealing meaningful information on the local properties of D(xt; σ(t)) at xt. As demonstrated in Figure 30, perturbing input xt along these vectors at difference noise regimes leads to distinct effects on the final generated images: (i) in the high-noise regime where the leading singular vectors align with the principal components of the training dataset, 6We only care about leading singular vectors since the Jacobians in this regime are highly low-rank. The less well aligned singular vectors have singular values near 0. 31Generation Trajectories                     &(\"#;$(%)) (a) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  )%)(\"#) (b) )( )) )* (c) *+(\",)across Various $(%)   (d) (e) (f) *&(\",)across Various $(%)   *-(\",)across Various $(%)   Figure 28: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels.

(2022) have presented a new type of diffusion process for generative modeling based on heat dissipation, or blurring, as an alternative to isotropic Gaussian diffusion. Here, we show that blurring can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise.

Finally, we propose a generalized class of diffusion models that offers the best of both standard Gaussian denoising diffusion and inverse heat dissipation, which we call Blurring Diffusion Models. 1 I NTRODUCTION Diffusion models are becoming increasingly successful for image generation, audio synthesis and video generation. Diffusion models define a (stochastic) process that destroys a signal such as an image. In general, this process adds Gaussian noise to each dimension independently. However, data such as images clearly exhibit multi-scale properties which such a diffusion process ignores. Recently, the community is looking at new destruction processes which are referred to as determin- istic or ‘cold’ diffusion (Rissanen et al., 2022; Bansal et al., 2022). In these works, the diffusion process is either deterministic or close to deterministic. For example, in (Rissanen et al., 2022) a diffusion model that incorporates heat dissipation is proposed, which can be seen as a form of blur- ring. Blurring is a natural destruction for images, because it retains low frequencies over higher frequencies. However, there still exists a considerable gap between the visual quality of standard denoising dif- fusion models and these new deterministic diffusion models. This difference cannot be explained away by a limited computational budget: A standard diffusion model can be trained with relative little compute (about one to four GPUs) with high visual quality on a task such as unconditional CIFAR10 generation1. In contrast, the visual quality of deterministic diffusion models have been 1An example of a denoising diffusion implementation https://github.com/w86763777/pytorch-ddpm (a) Diffusion (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) (b) Heat Dissipation (Rissanen et al., 2022) (c) Blurring Diffusion Figure 1: Comparison between standard diffusion, heat dissipation and blurring diffusion. 1 arXiv:2209.05557v3  [cs.LG]  1 May 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 much worse so far. In addition, fundamental questions remain around the justification of determin- istic diffusion models: Does their specification offer any guarantees about being able to model the data distribution? In this work, we aim to resolve the gap in quality between models using blurring and additive noise. We present Blurring Diffusion Models, which combine blurring (or heat dissipation) and additive Gaussian noise. We show that the given process can have Markov transitions and that the denoising process can be written with diagonal covariance in frequency space. As a result, we can use modern techniques from denoising diffusion. Our model generates samples with higher visual quality, which is evidenced by better FID scores. 2 B ACKGROUND 2.1 D IFFUSION MODELS Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) learn to gen- erate data by denoising a pre-defined destruction process which is named the diffusion process. Commonly, the diffusion process starts with a datapoint and gradually adds Gaussian noise to the datapoint. Before defining the generative process, this diffusion process needs to be defined. Fol- lowing the definition of (Kingma et al., 2021) the diffusion process can be written as: q(zt|x) = N(zt|αtx, σ2 t I), (1) where x represents the data and zt are the noisy latent variables. Since αt is monotonically decreas- ing and σt is monotonically increasing, the information from x in zt will be gradually destroyed as t increases. Assuming that the above process defined by Equation 1 is Markov, it has transition distributions for zt given zs where 0 ≤ s < t: q(zt|zs) = N(zt|αt|szs, σ2 t|sI), (2) where αt|s = αt/αs and σ2 t|s = σ2 t − α2 t|sσ2 s. A convenient property is that the grid of timesteps can be defined arbitrarily and does not depend on the specific spacing of s and t. We let T = 1 denote the last diffusion step where q(zT |x) ≈ N(zT |0, I), a standard normal distribution. Unless otherwise specified, a time step lies in the unit interval [0, 1]. The Denoising Process Another important distribution is the true denoising distribution q(zs|zt, x) given a datapoint x. Using that q(zs|zt, x) ∝ q(zt|zs)q(zs|x) one can derive that: q(zs|zt, x) = N(zs|µt→s, σ2 t→sI), (3) where σ2 t→s =   1 σ2s + α2 t|s σ2 t|s !−1 and µt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s zt + αs σ2s x ! (4) To generate data, the true denoising process is approximated by a learned denoising process p(zs|zt), where the datapoint x is replaced by a prediction from a learned model. The model distribution is then given by p(zs|zt) = q(zs|zt, ˆx(zt)), (5) where ˆx(zt) is a prediction provided by a neural network. As shown by Song et al. (2020), the true q(zs|zt) → q(zs|zt, x = E[x|zt]) as s → t, which justifies this choice of model: If the generative model takes sufficiently small steps, and if ˆx(zt) is sufficiently expressive, the model can learn the data distribution exactly. Instead of directly predictingx, diffusion models can also modelˆϵt = fθ(zt, t), where fθ is a neural net, so that: ˆx = zt/αt − σt/αtˆϵt, (6) which is inspired by the reparametrization to sample from Equation 1 which is zt = αtx + σtϵt. This parametrization is called the epsilon parametrization and empirically leads to better sample quality than predicting x directly (Ho et al., 2020). 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Optimization As shown in (Kingma et al., 2021), a continuous-time variational lower bound on the model log likelihood log p(x) is given by the following expectation over squared reconstruction errors: L = Et∼U(0,1)Eϵt∼N(0,I)[w(t)||fθ(zt, t) − ϵt||2], (7) where zt = αtxt+σtϵt. When these terms are weighted appropriately with a particular weightw(t), this objective corresponds to a variational lowerbound on the model likelihood log p(x). However, empirically a constant weighting w(t) = 1 has been found to be superior for sample quality. 2.2 I NVERSE HEAT DISSIPATION Instead of adding increasing amounts of Gaussian noise, Inverse Heat Dissipation Models (IHDMs) use heat dissipation to destroy information (Rissanen et al., 2022). They observe that the Laplace partial differential equation for heat dissipation ∂ ∂t z(i, j, t) = ∆z(i, j, t) (8) can be solved by a diagonal matrix in the frequency domain of the cosine transform if the signal is discretized to a grid. Letting zt denote the solution to the Laplace equation at time-step t, this can be efficiently computed by: zt = Atz0 = VDtVTz0 (9) where VT denotes a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and V denotes the Inverse DCT and z0, zt should be considered vectorized over spatial dimensions to allow for matrix multiplication. The diagonal matrix Dt is the exponent of a weighting matrix for frequenciesΛ and the dissipation time t so that Dt = exp( −Λt). For the specific definition of Λ see Appendix A. In (Rissanen et al., 2022) marginal distribution of the diffusion process is defined as: q(zt|x) = N(zt|Atx, σ2I). (10) The intermediate diffusion state zt is thus constructed by adding a fixed amount of noise to an increasingly blurred data point, rather than adding an increasing amount of noise as in the DDPMs described in Section 2.1. The generative process in (Rissanen et al., 2022) approximately inverts the heat dissipation process with a learned generative model: p(zt−1|zt) = N(zt−1|fθ(zt), δ2I), (11) where the mean forzt−1 is directly learned with a neural networkfθ and has fixed scalar varianceδ2. Similar to DDPMs, the IHDM model is learned by sampling from the forward processzt ∼ q(zt|x) for a random timestep t, and then minimizing the squared reconstruction error between the model fθ(zt) and a ground truth target, which in this case is given by E(zt−1|x) = At−1x, yielding the training loss L = Et∼U(1,...,T)Ezt∼q(zt|x) \u0002 ||At−1x − fθ(zt, t)||2\u0003 . Arbitrary Dissipation Schedule There is no reason why the conceptual time-steps of the model should match perfectly with the dissipation time. Therefore, in (Rissanen et al., 2022) Dt = exp(−Λτt) is redefined where τt monotonically increases with t. The variable τt has a very similar function as αt and σt in noise diffusion: it allows for arbitrary dissipation schedules with respect to the conceptual time-steps t of the model. To avoid confusion, note that in (Rissanen et al., 2022) k is used as the conceptual time for the diffusion process, tk is the dissipation time and uk denotes the latent variables. In this paper, t is the conceptual time and zt denotes the latent variables in pixel space. Then τt is used to denote dissipation time. Open Questions Certain questions remain: (1) Can the heat dissipation process be Markov and if so what is q(zt|zs)? (2) Is the true inverse heating process also isotropic, as the generative process in Equation 11? (3) Finally, are there alternatives to predicting the mean of the previous time-step? In the following section it will turn out that: (1) Yes, the process can be Markov. As a result, de- noising equations similar to the ones for standard diffusion can be derived. (2) No, the generative process is not isotropic, although it is diagonal in the frequency domain. As a consequence, the 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 correct amount of noise (per-dimension) can be derived analytically instead of choosing it heuristi- cally. This also guarantees that the model p(zs|zt) can actually express the true q(zs|zt) as s → t, because it is known to tend towards q(zs|zt, x = E[x|zt]) (Song et al., 2020). (3) Yes, processes like heat dissipation can be parametrized similar to the epsilon parametrization in standard diffusion models. 3 H EAT DISSIPATION AS GAUSSIAN DIFFUSION Here we reinterpret the heat dissipation process as a form of Gaussian diffusion similar to that used in (Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019) and others. Throughout this paper, multiplication and division between two vectors is defined to be elementwise. We start with the definition of the marginal distribution from (Rissanen et al., 2022): q(zt|x) = N(zt|Atx, σ2I) (12) where At = VDtVT denotes the blurring or dissipation operation as defined in the previous sec- tion. Throughout this section we let VT denote the orthogonal DCT, which is a specific normal- ization setting of the DCT. Under the change of variables ut = VTzt we can write the diffusion process in frequency space for ut: q(ut|ux) = N(ut|dt · ux, σ2I) (13) where ux = VTx is the frequency response ofx, dt is the diagonal of Dt and vector multiplication is done elementwise. Whereas we defined Dt = exp(−Λτt) we let λ denote the diagonal of Λ so that dt = exp(−λτt). Essentially, dt multiplies higher frequencies with smaller values. Equation 13 shows that the marginal distribution of the frequencies ut is fully factorized over its scalar elements u(i) t for each dimension i. Similarly, the inverse heat dissipation modelpθ(us|ut) is also fully factorized. We can thus equivalently describe the heat dissipation process (and its inverse) in scalar form for each dimension i: q(u(i) t |u(i) 0 ) = N(u(i) t |d(i) t u(i) 0 , σ2) ⇔ u(i) t = d(i) t u(i) 0 + σϵt, with ϵt ∼ N(0, 1). (14) This equation can be recognized as a special case of the standard Gaussian diffusion process introduced in Section 2.1. Let st denote a standard diffusion process in frequency space, so s(i) t = αtu(i) 0 + σtϵt. We can see that Rissanen et al. (2022) have chosen αt = d(i) t and σ2 t = σ2. As shown by Kingma et al. (2021), from a probabilistic perspective only the ratio αt/σt matters here, not the particular choice of the individual αt, σt. This is true because all values can simply be re-scaled without changing the distributions in a meaningful way. This means that, rather than performing blurring and adding fixed noise, the heat dissipation process can be equivalently defined as a relatively standard Gaussian diffusion process, albeit in frequency space. The non-standard aspect here is that the diffusion process in (Rissanen et al., 2022) is defined in the frequency space u, and that it uses a separate noise schedule αt, σt for each of the scalar elements of u: i.e. the noise in this process is non-isotropic. That the marginal variance σ2 is shared between all scalars u(i) under their specification does not reduce its generality: the ratio αt/σ can be freely determined per dimension, and this is all that matters. Markov transition distributions An open question in the formulation of heat dissipation models by Rissanen et al. (2022) was whether or not there exists a Markov processq(ut|us) that corresponds to their chosen marginal distribution q(zt|x). Through its equivalence to Gaussian diffusion shown above, we can now answer this question affirmatively. Using the results summarized in Section 2.1, we have that this process is given by q(ut|us) = N(u|αt|sus, σ2 t|s) (15) where αt|s = αt/αs and σ2 t|s = σ2 t −α2 t|sσ2 s. Substituting in the choices of Rissanen et al. (2022), αt = dt and σ(i) t = σ, then gives αt|s = dt/ds and σ2 t|s = (1 − (dt/ds)2)σ2. (16) Note that if dt is chosen so that it contains lower values for higher frequencies, then σt|s will add more noiseon the higher frequenciesper timestep. The heat dissipation model thus destroys information more quickly for those frequencies as compared to standard diffusion. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 2: A blurring diffusion process with latent variable z0, . . . ,z1 is diagonal (meaning can be factorized over dimensions) in frequency space, under the change of variable ut = VTzt. This results in a corresponding diffusion process in frequency space u0, . . . ,u1. Denoising Process Using again the results from Section 2.1, we can find an analytic expression for the inverse heat dissipation process: q(us|ut, x) = N(us|µt→s, σ2 t→s), (17) where σ2 t→s =   1 σ2s + α2 t|s σ2 t|s !−1 and µt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s ut + αs σ2s ux ! . (18) Except for ux, we can again plug in the expressions derived above in terms of dt, σ2. The analysis in Section 2.1 then allows predicting ϵt using a neural network to complete the model, as is done in standard denoising diffusion models. In comparison (Rissanen et al., 2022) predict µt→s directly, which is theoretically equally general but has been found to lead to inferior sample quality. Further- more, they instead chose to use a single scalar value for σ2 t→s for all time-steps: the downside of this is that it loses the guarantee of correctness as s → t as described in Section 2.1. 4 B LURRING DIFFUSION MODELS In this section we propose Blurring Diffusion Models. Using the analysis from Section 3, we can define this model in frequency space as a Gaussian diffusion model, with different schedules for the dimensions. Blurring diffusion places more on emphasis low frequencies which are visually more important, and it may also avoid over-fitting to high frequencies. It is important how the model is parametrized and what the specific schedules for αt and σt are. Different from traditional models, the diffusion process is defined in a frequency space: q(ut|ux) = N(ut|αtux, σ2 t I) (19) and different frequencies may diffuse at a different rate, which is controlled by the values in the vec- tors αt, σt (although we will end up picking the same scalar value for all dimensions in σt). Recall that the denoising distribution is then given by q(us|ut, x) = N(us|µt→s, σ2 t→s) as specified in Equation 17. Learning and Parametrization An important reason for the performance of modern diffusion models is the parametrization. Learning µt→s directly turns out to be difficult for neural networks and instead an approximation for x is learned which is plugged into the denoising distributions, often indirectly via an epsilon parametrization (Ho et al., 2020). Studying the re-parametrization of Equation 19: ut = αtux + σtuϵ,t where ux = VTx and uϵ,t = VTϵt (20) and take that as inspiration for the way we parametrize our model: \u0010 ut − σt ˆuϵ,t \u0011 /αt = ˆux, (21) 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1Generating Samples Sample zT ∼ N(0, I) for t in {T T , . . . ,1 T } where s = t − 1/T do ut = VTz and ˆuϵ,t = VTfθ(z, t) Compute σt→s and ˆµt→s with Eq. 18, 23 Sample ϵ ∼ N(0, I) z ← V(ˆµt→s + σt→sϵ) Algorithm 2Optimizing Blurring Diffusion Sample t ∼ U(0, 1) Sample ϵ ∼ N(0, I) Minimize ||ϵ − fθ(VαtVTx + σtϵ, t)||2 which is the blurring diffusion counterpart of Equation 6 from standard diffusion models. Although it is convenient to express our diffusion and denoising processes in frequency space, neural networks have been optimized to work well in standard pixel space. It is for this reason that the neural network fθ takes as input zt = Vut and predicts ˆϵt. After prediction we can always easily transition back and forth between frequency space if needed using the DCT matrix VT and inverse DCT matrix V. This is how ˆuϵ,t = VTˆϵt is obtained. Using this parametrization for ˆx and after transforming to frequency space ˆux = VT ˆx we can compute ˆµt→s using Equation 18 where ux is replaced by the prediction ˆux to give: p(us|ut) = q(us|ut, ˆux) = N(us|ˆµt→s, σt→s) (22) for which ˆµt→s can be simplified further in terms of ˆuϵ,t instead of ˆux: ˆµt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s ut + 1 αt|sσ2s (ut − σt ˆuϵ,t) ! . (23) Optimization Following the literature (Ho et al., 2020) we optimize an unweighted squared error in pixel space: L = Et∼U(0,1)Eϵt∼N(0,I)[||fθ(zt, t) − ϵt||2], where zt = V(αtVTxt + σtVTϵt). (24) Alternatively, one can derive a variational bound objective which corresponds to a different weight- ing as explained in section 2.1. However, it is known that such objectives tend to result in inferior sample quality (Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021). Noise and Blurring SchedulesTo specify the blurring process precisely, the schedules forαt, σt need to be defined for t ∈ [0, 1]. For σt we choose the same value for all frequencies, so it suffices to give a schedule for a scalar value σt. The schedules are constructed by combining a typical Gaussian noise diffusion schedule (specified by scalars at, σt) with a blurring schedule (specified by the vectors dt). For the noise schedule, following (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) we choose a variance preserving cosine schedule meaning that σ2 t = 1−a2 t , where at = cos(tπ/2) for t ∈ [0, 1]. To avoid instabilities when t → 0 and t → 1, the log signal to noise ratio (log a2 t /σ2 t ) is at maximum +10 for t = 0 and at least −10 for t = 1. See (Kingma et al., 2021) for more details regarding the relation between the signal to noise ratio and at, σt. For the blurring schedule, we use the relation from (Rissanen et al., 2022) that a Gaussian blur with scale σB corresponds to dissipation with time τ = σ2 B/2. Empirically we found the blurring schedule: σB,t = σB,max sin(tπ/2)2 (25) to work well, where σB,max is a tune-able hyperparameter that corresponds to the maximum blur that will be applied to the image. This schedule in turn defines the dissipation time via τt = σ2 B,t/2. As described in Equation 23, the denoising process divides elementwise by the termαt|s = αt/αs. If one would naively use dt = exp(−λτt) for αt and equivalently for step s, then the term dt/ds could contain very small values for high frequencies. As a result, an undesired side-effect is that small errors may be amplified by many steps of the denoising process. Therefore, we modify the procedure slightly and let: dt = (1 − dmin) · exp(−λτt) + dmin, (26) where we set dmin = 0.001. This blurring transformation damps frequencies to a small value dmin and at the same time the denoising process amplifies high frequencies less aggressively. Because 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 (Rissanen et al., 2022) did not use the denoising process, this modification was not necessary for their model. Combining the Gaussian noise schedule ( at, σt) with the blurring schedule ( dt) we obtain: αt = at · dt and σt = 1σt, (27) where 1 is a vector of ones. See Appendix A for more details on the implementation and specific settings. 4.1 A NOTE ON THE GENERALITY In general, an orthogonal base ux = VTx that has a diagonal diffusion process q(ut|ux) = N(ut|αtux, σ2 t I) corresponds to the following process in pixel space: q(zt|x) =N(zt|Vdiag(αt)VTx, Vdiag(σ2 t )VT) where ut = VTzt, (28) where diag transforms a vector to a diagonal matrix. More generally, a diffusion process defined in any invertible basis change ux = P−1x corresponds to the following diffusion process in pixel space: q(zt|x) =N(zt|Pdiag(αt)P−1x, Pdiag(σ2 t )PT) where ut = P−1zt. (29) As such, this framework enables a larger class of diffusion models,with the guarantees of standard diffusion models. 5 R ELATED WORK Score-based diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) have become increasingly successfully in modelling different types of data, such as images (Dhari- wal & Nichol, 2021), audio (Kong et al., 2021), and steady states of physical systems (Xu et al., 2022). Most diffusion processes are diagonal, meaning that they can be factorized over dimensions. The vast majority relies on independent additive isotropic Gaussian noise as a diffusion process. Several diffusion models use a form of super-resolution to account for the multi-scale properties in images (Ho et al., 2022; Jing et al., 2022). These methods still rely on additive isotropic Gaussian noise, but have explicit transitions between different resolutions. In other works (Serrà et al., 2022; Kawar et al., 2022) diffusion models are used to restore predefined corruptions on image or audio data, although these models do not generate data from scratch. Theis et al. (2022) discuss non- isotropic Gaussian diffusion processes in the context of lossy compression. They find that non- isotropic Gaussian diffusion, such as our blurring diffusion models, can lead to improved results if the goal is to encode data with minimal mean-squared reconstruction loss under a reconstruction model that is constrained to obey the ground truth marginal data distribution, though the benefit over standard isotropic diffusion is greater for different objectives. Recently, several works introduce other destruction processes as an alternative to Gaussian diffusion with little to no noise. Although pre-existing works invert fixed amounts of blur (Kupyn et al., 2018; Whang et al., 2022), in (Rissanen et al., 2022) blurring is directly built into the diffusion process via heat dissipation. Similarly, in (Bansal et al., 2022) several (possibly deterministic) destruction mechanisms are proposed which are referred to as ‘cold diffusion’. However, the generative pro- cesses of these approaches may not be able to properly learn the reveres process if they do not satisfy the condition discussed in section 2.1. Furthermore in (Lee et al., 2022) a process is introduced that combines blurring and noise and is variance preserving in frequency space, which may not be the ideal inductive bias for images. Concurrently, in (Daras et al., 2022) a method is introduced that can incorporate blurring with noise, although sampling is done differently. For all these approaches, there is still a considerably gap in performance compared to standard denoising diffusion. 6 E XPERIMENTS 6.1 C OMPARISON WITH DETERMINISTIC AND DENOISING DIFFUSION MODELS In this section our proposed Blurring Diffusion Models are compared to their closest competitor in literature, IHDMs (Rissanen et al., 2022), and to Cold Diffusion Models (Bansal et al., 2022). In addition, they are also compared to a denoising diffusion baseline similar to DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020) which we refer to as Denoising Diffusion. 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 1: Sample quality on CIFAR10 mea- sured in FID score, lower is better.

CIFAR10 The first generation task is generating im- ages when trained on the CIFAR10 dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). For this task, we run the blurring diffu- sion model and the denoising diffusion baseline both us- ing the same UNet architecture as their noise predictor fθ. Specifically, the UNet operates at resolutions32×32, 16 ×16 and 8 ×8 with 256 channels at each level. At ev- ery resolution, the UNet has 3 residual blocks associated with the down-sampling section and another 3 blocks for the up-sampling section. Furthermore, the UNet has self- attention at resolutions 16 × 16 and 8 × 8 with a single head. Although IHDMs used only 128 channels on the 32 × 32 resolutions, they use 256 channels on all other resolutions, they include the 4 × 4 resolution and use 4 blocks instead of 3 blocks. Also see Appendix A.2. To measure the visual quality of the generated samples we use the FID score measured on 50000 samples drawn from the models, after 2 million steps of training. As can be seen from these scores (Table 1), the blurring diffusion models are able to generate images with a considerable higher quality than IHDMs, as well as other similar approaches in literature. Our blurring diffusion models also outperform standard denoising diffusion models, although the difference in performance is less pronounced in that case. Random samples drawn from the model are depicted in Figure 3. Figure 4: Samples from a Blurring Diffusion model trained on LSUN churches 128× 128. LSUN Churches Secondly, we test the perfor- mance of the model when trained on LSUN Churches with a resolution of 128 × 128. Again, a UNet architecture is used for the noise predic- tion network fθ. This time the UNet operates on 64 channels for the 128 × 128 resolution, 128 chan- nels for the 64 × 64 resolution, 256 channels for the 32×32 resolution, 384 channels for the 16×16 res- olution, and 512 channels for the 8×8 resolution. At each resolution there are two sections with3 residual blocks, with self-attention on the resolutions32×32, 16 × 16, and 8 × 8. The models in (Rissanen et al., 2022) use more channels at each resolution level but only 2 residual blocks (see Appendix A.2). The visual quality is measured by computing the FID score on 10000 samples drawn from trained mod- els. From these scores (Table 2) again we see that the blurring diffusion models generate higher qual- ity images than IHDMs. Furthermore, Blurring Dif- fusion models also outperform denoising diffusion models, although again the difference in performance is smaller in that comparison. See Appendix B for more experiments. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 3: Blurring Diffusion Models with dif- ferent maximum noise values σB,max CIFAR10 LSUN Churches (128×) 0 3.60 4.68 1 3.49 4.42 10 3.26 3.65 20 3.17 3.88 Table 4: Different maximum noise levels and schedules on CIFAR10 σB,max σB,maxsin(tπ/2)2 σB,maxsin(tπ/2) 0 3.60 3.58 1 3.49 3.37 10 3.26 4.24 20 3.17 6.54 6.2 C OMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT NOISE LEVELS AND SCHEDULES In this section we analyze the models from above, but with different settings in terms of maximum blur (σB,max) and two different noise schedule ( sin2 and sin). The models where σB,max = 0 are equivalent to a standard denoising diffusion model. For CIFAR10, the best performing model uses a blur of σB,max = 20 which has an FID of 3.17 over 3.60 when no blur is applied, as can be seen in Table 3. The difference compared to the model with σB,max = 10 is relatively small, with an FID of 3.26. For LSUN Churches, the the best performing model uses a little less blurσB,max = 10 although performance is again relatively close to the model with σB,max = 20. When comparing the sin2 schedule with a sin schedule, the visual quality measured by FID score seems to be much better for the sin2 schedule (Table 4). In fact, for higher maximum blur the sin2 schedule performs much better. Our hypothesis is that the sin schedule blurs too aggressively, whereas the graph of a sin2 adds blur more gradually at the beginning of the diffusion process near t = 0. Interesting behaviour of blurring diffusion models is that models with higher maximum blur (σB,max) converge more slowly, but when trained long enough outperform models with less blur. When comparing two blurring models withσB,max set to either1 or 20, the model withσB,max = 20 has better visual quality only after roughly 200K training steps for CIFAR10 and 1M training steps for LSUN churches. It seems that higher blur takes more time to train, but then learns to fit the data better. Note that an exception was made for the evaluation of the CIFAR10 models whereσB,max is 0 and 1, as those models show over-fitting behaviour and have better FID at 1 million steps than at 2 million steps. Regardless of this selection advantage, they are outperformed by blurring diffusion models with higher σB,max. 7 L IMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION In this paper we introduced blurring diffusion models, a class of generative models generalizing over the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) of Ho et al. (2020) and the Inverse Heat Dissipation Models (IHDM) of Rissanen et al. (2022). In doing so, we showed that blurring data, and several other such deterministic transformations with addition of fixed variance Gaussian noise, can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. This allowed us to make connections to the literature on non-isotropic diffusion models (e.g. Theis et al., 2022), which allows us to better understand the inductive bias imposed by this model class. Using our proposed model class, we were able to generate images with improved perceptual quality compared to both DDPM and IHDM baselines. A limitation of blurring diffusion models is that the use of blur has a regularizing effect: When using blur it takes longer to train a generative model to convergence. Such as regularizing effect is often beneficial, and can lead to improved sample quality as we showed in Section 6, but may not be desirable when very large quantities of training data are available. As we discuss in Section 4, the expected benefit of blurring is also dependent on our particular objective, and will differ for different ways of measuring sample quality: We briefly explored this in Section 6, but we leave a more exhaustive exploration of the tradeoffs in this model class for future work. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 REFERENCES Arpit Bansal, Eitan Borgnia, Hong-Min Chu, Jie S.

OpenReview.net, 2022. 11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 A A DDITIONAL DETAILS ON BLURRING DIFFUSION In this section we provide additional details for blurring diffusion models. In particular, we provide some pseudo-code to show the essential steps that are needed to compute the variables associated with the diffusion process. A.1 P SEUDO -CODE OF DIFFUSION AND DENOISING PROCESS Firstly, the procedure to compute the frequency scaling (dt) is given below: def get_frequency_scaling (t, min_scale =0.001): # compute dissipation time sigma_blur = sigma_blur_max * sin (t * pi / 2)^2 dissipation_time = sigma_t ^2 / 2 # compute frequencies freq = pi * linspace (0 , img_dim -1 , img_dim ) / img_dim labda = freqs [None , :, None , None ]^2 + freqs [None , None , :, None ]^2 # compute scaling for frequencies scaling = exp (- labda * dissipation_time ) * (1 - min_scale ) scaling = scaling + min_scale return scaling Note here the computation of Λ is from (Rissanen et al., 2022) and the variable ‘scaling’ refers to dt in equations. Next, we can define a wrapper function to return the required αt, σt values. def get_alpha_sigma (t): freq_scaling = get_frequency_scaling (t) a, sigma = get_noise_scaling_cosine (t) alpha = a * freq_scaling # Combine dissipation and scaling . return alpha , sigma Which also requires a function to obtain the noise parameters. We use a typical cosine schedule for which the pseudo-code is given below: def get_noise_schaling_cosine (t, logsnr_min = -10 , logsnr_max =10): limit_max = arctan ( exp ( -0.5 * logsnr_max )) limit_min = arctan ( exp ( -0.5 * logsnr_min )) - limit_max logsnr = -2 * log ( tan ( limit_min * t + limit_max )) # Transform logsnr to a, sigma . return sqrt ( sigmoid ( logsnr )) , sqrt ( sigmoid (- logsnr )) To train the model we desire samples from q(ut|ux). In the pseudo-code below, the inputs (x) and outputs (zt, ϵt) are defined in pixel space. Recall that zt = Vut = IDCT(ut) and then: def diffuse (x, t): x_freq = DCT (x) alpha , sigma = get_alpha_sigma (t) eps = random_normal_like (x) # Since we chose sigma to be a scalar , eps does not need to be # passed through a DCT / IDCT in this case . z_t = IDCT ( alpha * x_freq ) + sigma * eps return z_t , eps Given samples zt from the diffusion process one can now directly define the mean squared error loss on epsilon as defined below: 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 def loss (x): t = random_uniform (0 , 1) z_t , eps = diffuse (x, t) error = ( eps - neural_net (z_t , t ))^2 return mean ( error ) Finally, to sample from the model we repeatedly sample fromp(zt−1/T |zt) for the grid of timesteps t = T, T− 1/T . . . ,1/T. def denoise (z_t , t, delta =1e -8): alpha_s , sigma_s = get_alpha_sigma (t - 1 / T) alpha_t , sigma_t = get_alpha_sigma (t) # Compute helpful coefficients . alpha_ts = alpha_t / alpha_s alpha_st = 1 / alpha_ts sigma2_ts = ( sigma_t ^2 - alpha_ts ^2 * sigma_s ^2) # Denoising variance . sigma2_denoise = 1 / clip ( 1 / clip ( sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ) + 1 / clip ( sigma_t ^2 / alpha_ts ^2 - sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ), min = delta ) # The coefficients for u_t and u_eps . coeff_term1 = alpha_ts * sigma2_denoise / ( sigma2_ts + delta ) coeff_term2 = alpha_st * sigma2_denoise / clip ( sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ) # Get neural net prediction . hat_eps = neural_net (z_t , t) # Compute terms . u_t = DCT ( z_t ) term1 = IDCT ( coeff_term1 * u_t ) term2 = IDCT ( coeff_term2 * ( u_t - sigma_t * DCT ( hat_eps ))) mu_denoise = term1 + term2 # Sample from the denoising distribution . eps = random_normal_like ( mu_denoise ) return mu_denoise + IDCT ( sqrt ( sigma2_denoise ) * eps ) More efficient implementations that use less DCT calls are also possible when the denoising function is directly defined in frequency space. This is not really an issue however, because compared to the neural network the DCTs are relatively cheap. Additionally, several values are clipped to a minimum of 10−8 to avoid numerically unstable divisions. In the sampling process of standard diffusion, before using the prediction ˆϵ the variable is trans- formed to ˆx, clipped and then transformed back to ˆϵ. This procedure is known to improve visual quality scores for standard denoising diffusion, but it is not immediately clear how to apply the tech- nique in the case of blurring diffusion. For future research, finding a reliable technique to perform clipping without introducing frequency artifacts may be important. A.2 H YPERPARAMETER SETTINGS In the experiments, the neural network function ( fθ in equations) is implemented as a UNet archi- tecture, as is typical in modern diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020). For the specific architecture details see Table 5. Note that as is standard in UNet architectures, there is an downsample and up- sample path. Following the common notation, the hyperparameter ‘ResBlocks / Stage’ denotes the blocks per stage per upsample/downsample path. Thus, a level with 3 ResBlocks per stage as in total 3 + (3 + 1) = 7ResBlocks, where the (3 + 1)originates from the upsample path which always uses an additional block. In addition, the downsample / upsample blocks also apply an additional ResBlock. All models where optimized with Adam, with a learning rate of 2 · 10−4 and batch size 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 128 for CIFAR-10 and a learning rate of 1 · 10−4 and batch size 256 for the LSUN models. All methods are evaluated with an exponential moving average computed with a decay of 0.9999.

In Table 6 the FID score on the eval set of CIFAR10 and LSUN churches128 × 128 is presented. The best performing models match with the results in the main text on train FID. For CIFAR10, we also report the Inception Score which corresponds to the certainty of the Inception classifier. Here the results are less clear, because all models have roughly similar scores. The best performing model uses σB,max = 10 and achieves 9.59. To confirm that the loss and parametrization are important, the best CIFAR10 model (with σB,max = 20 ) is trained using a mean squared error on x − ˆx when predicting ˆx, but this only achieves 23.9 FID versus the 3.17 of the epsilon parametrization. This diminished performance is also observed for standard diffusion (Ho et al., 2020). Furthermore, as an ablation study we trained the best performing model in the frequency domain (where the UNet takes as input ut). This model only produced gray samples with some checkerboard artifacts, and had a higher loss throughout training. This indicates that learning a UNet directly in frequency space is not straightforward.

Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2208.09392v1  [cs.CV]  19 Aug 20221 Introduction Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling [Ramesh et al., 2022]. Diffusion models come in many ﬂavors, but all are built around the concept of random noise removal; one trains an image restoration/denoising network that accepts an image contaminated with Gaussian noise, and outputs a denoised image. At test time, the denoising network is used to convert pure Gaussian noise into a photo-realistic image using an update rule that alternates between applying the denoiser and adding Gaussian noise. When the right sequence of updates is applied, complex generative behavior is observed. The origins of diffusion models, and also our theoretical understanding of these models, are strongly based on the role played by Gaussian noise during training and generation. Diffusion has been understood as a random walk around the image density function using Langevin dynamics [Sohl- Dickstein et al., 2015, Song and Ermon, 2019], which requires Gaussian noise in each step. The walk begins in a high temperature (heavy noise) state, and slowly anneals into a “cold” state with little if any noise. Another line of work derives the loss for the denoising network using variational inference with a Gaussian prior [Ho et al., 2020, Song et al., 2021a, Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021]. In this work, we examine the need for Gaussian noise, or any randomness at all, for diffusion models to work in practice. We consider generalized diffusion models that live outside the conﬁnes of the theoretical frameworks from which diffusion models arose. Rather than limit ourselves to models built around Gaussian noise, we consider models built around arbitrary image transformations like blurring, downsampling, etc. We train a restoration network to invert these deformations using a simple ℓp loss. When we apply a sequence of updates at test time that alternate between the image restoration model and the image degradation operation, generative behavior emerges, and we obtain photo-realistic images. The existence of cold diffusions that require no Gaussian noise (or any randomness) during training or testing raises questions about the limits of our theoretical understanding of diffusion models. It also unlocks the door for potentially new types of generative models with very different properties than conventional diffusion seen so far. 2 Background Generative models exist for a range of modalities spanning natural language [Brown et al., 2020] and images [Brock et al., 2019, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021], and they can be extended to solve important problems such as image restoration [Kawar et al., 2021a, 2022]. While GANs [Goodfellow et al., 2014] have historically been the tool of choice for image synthesis [Brock et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2019], diffusion models [Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015] have recently become competitive if not superior for some applications [Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Nichol et al., 2021, Ramesh et al., 2021, Meng et al., 2021]. Both the Langevin dynamics and variational inference interpretations of diffusion models rely on properties of the Gaussian noise used in the training and sampling pipelines. From the score-matching generative networks perspective [Song and Ermon, 2019, Song et al., 2021b], noise in the training process is critically thought to expand the support of the low-dimensional training distribution to a set of full measure in ambient space. The noise is also thought to act as data augmentation to improve score predictions in low density regions, allowing for mode mixing in the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampling. The gradient signal in low-density regions can be further improved during sampling by injecting large magnitudes of noise in the early steps of SGLD and gradually reducing this noise in later stages. Kingma et al. [2021] propose a method to learn a noise schedule that leads to faster optimization. Using a classic statistical result, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli [2021] show the connection between removing additive Gaussian noise and the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density in determin- istic linear inverse problems. Here, we shed light on the role of noise in diffusion models through theoretical and empirical results in applications to inverse problems and image generation. Iterative neural models have been used for various inverse problems [Romano et al., 2016, Metzler et al., 2017]. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to them [Song et al., 2021b] for the 2problems of deblurring, denoising, super-resolution, and compressive sensing [Whang et al., 2021, Kawar et al., 2021b, Saharia et al., 2021, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli, 2021]. Although not their focus, previous works on diffusion models have included experiments with deterministic image generation [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021] and in selected inverse problems [Kawar et al., 2022]. Here, we show deﬁnitively that noise is not a necessity in diffusion models, and we observe the effects of removing noise for a number of inverse problems. Despite proliﬁc work on generative models in recent years, methods to probe the properties of learned distributions and measure how closely they approximate the real training data are by no means closed ﬁelds of investigation. Indirect feature space similarity metrics such as Inception Score [Salimans et al., 2016], Mode Score [Che et al., 2016], Frechet inception distance (FID) [Heusel et al., 2017], and Kernel inception distance (KID) [Bi´nkowski et al., 2018] have been proposed and adopted to some extent, but they have notable limitations [Barratt and Sharma, 2018]. To adopt a popular frame of reference, we will use FID as the feature similarity metric for our experiments. 3 Generalized Diffusion Standard diffusion models are built around two components. First, there is an image degradation operator that contaminates images with Gaussian noise. Second, a trained restoration operator is created to perform denoising. The image generation process alternates between the application of these two operators. In this work, we consider the construction of generalized diffusions built around arbitrary degradation operations. These degradations can be randomized (as in the case of standard diffusion) or deterministic. 3.1 Model components and training Given an image x0 ∈RN, consider the degradation of x0 by operator Dwith severity t,denoted xt = D(x0,t). The output distribution D(x0,t) of the degradation should vary continuously in t, and the operator should satisfy D(x0,0) = x0. In the standard diffusion framework, Dadds Gaussian noise with variance proportional to t. In our generalized formulation, we choose Dto perform various other transformations such as blurring, masking out pixels, downsampling, and more, with severity that depends on t. We explore a range of choices for Din Section 4. We also require a restoration operator R that (approximately) inverts D. This operator has the property that R(xt,t) ≈x0. In practice, this operator is implemented via a neural network parameterized by θ. The restoration network is trained via the minimization problem min θ Ex∼X∥Rθ(D(x,t),t) −x∥, (1) where xdenotes a random image sampled from distribution Xand ∥·∥ denotes a norm, which we take to be ℓ1 in our experiments. We have so far used the subscript Rθ to emphasize the dependence of Ron θduring training, but we will omit this symbol for simplicity in the discussion below. 3.2 Sampling from the model After choosing a degradation Dand training a model Rto perform the restoration, these operators can be used in tandem to invert severe degradations by using standard methods borrowed from the diffusion literature. For small degradations (t≈0), a single application of Rcan be used to obtain a restored image in one shot. However, because Ris typically trained using a simple convex loss, it yields blurry results when used with large t. Rather, diffusion models [Song et al., 2021a, Ho et al., 2020] perform generation by iteratively applying the denoising operator and then adding noise back to the image, with the level of added noise decreasing over time. This corresponds to the standard update sequence in Algorithm 1. 3Algorithm 1 Naive Sampling Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = D(ˆx0,s −1) end for Return: x0 Algorithm 2 Improved Sampling for Cold Diffusion Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = xs −D(ˆx0,s) + D(ˆx0,s −1) end for When the restoration operator is perfect, i.e. when R(D(x0,t),t) = x0 for all t,one can easily see that Algorithm 1 produces exact iterates of the form xs = D(x0,s). But what happens for imperfect restoration op- erators? In this case, errors can cause the iterates xs to wander away from D(x0,s), and inaccurate reconstruction may occur. We ﬁnd that the standard sampling ap- proach in Algorithm 1 works well for noise-based diffusion, possibly because the restoration operator R has been trained to correct (random Gaussian) errors in its inputs. However, we ﬁnd that it yields poor results in the case of cold diffusions with smooth/differentiable degradations as demonstrated for a deblurring model in Figure 2. We propose Algorithm 2 for sampling, which we ﬁnd to be superior for inverting smooth, cold degradations. This sampler has important mathematical properties that enable it to recover high quality results. Speciﬁcally, for a class of linear degradation operations, it can be shown to produce exact reconstruc- tion (i.e. xs = D(x0,s)) even when the restoration operator Rfails to perfectly invert D. We discuss this in the following section. 3.3 Properties of Algorithm 2 Figure 2: Comparison of sampling methods for cold diffusion on the CelebA dataset. Top: Algorithm 1 produces compounding artifacts and fails to generate a new image. Bottom: Algorithm 2 succeeds in sam- pling a high quality image without noise. It is clear from inspection that both Algo- rithms 1 and 2 perfectly reconstruct the it- erate xs = D(x0,s) for all s < tif the restoration operator is a perfect inverse for the degradation operator. In this section, we analyze the stability of these algorithms to errors in the restoration operator. For small values of xand s, Algorithm 2 is extremely tolerant of error in the restoration operator R. To see why, consider a model problem with a linear degradation function of the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·efor some vector e. While this ansatz may seem rather restrictive, note that the Taylor expansion of any smooth degradation D(x,s) around x = x0,s = 0 has the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·e+ HOT where HOT denotes higher order terms. Note that the constant/zeroth-order term in this Taylor expansion is zero because we assumed above that the degradation operator satisﬁes D(x,0) = x. For a degradation of the form (3.3) and any restoration operator R, the update in Algorithm 2 can be written xs−1 = xs −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = D(x0,s) −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = x0 + s·e−R(xs,s) −s·e+ R(xs,s) + (s−1) ·e = x0 + (s−1) ·e = D(x0,s −1) By induction, we see that the algorithm produces the value xs = D(x0,s) for all s<t, regardless of the choice of R. In other words, for any choice of R, the iteration behaves the same as it would when Ris a perfect inverse for the degradation D. By contrast, Algorithm 1 does not enjoy this behavior. In fact, when Ris not a perfect inverse for D, x0 is not even a ﬁxed point of the update rule in Algorithm 1 becausex0 ̸= D(R(x,0),0) = R(x,0). If Rdoes not perfectly invert Dwe should expect Algorithm 1 to incur errors, even for small values 4of s. Meanwhile, for small values of s, the behavior of Dapproaches its ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion and Algorithm 2 becomes immune to errors in R. We demonstrate the stability of Algorithm 2 vs Algorithm 1 on a deblurring model in Figure 2. 4 Generalized Diffusions with Various Transformations In this section, we take the ﬁrst step towards cold diffusion by reversing different degradations and hence performing conditional generation. We will extend our methods to perform unconditional (i.e. from scratch) generation in Section 5. We emprically evaluate generalized diffusion models trained on different degradations with our improved sampling Algorithm 2. We perform experiments on the vision tasks of deblurring, inpainting, super-resolution, and the unconventional task of synthetic snow removal. We perform our experiments on MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], CIFAR-10 [Krizhevsky, 2009], and CelebA [Liu et al., 2015]. In each of these tasks, we gradually remove the information from the clean image, creating a sequence of images such that D(x0,t) retains less information than D(x0,t −1). For these different tasks, we present both qualitative and quantitative results on a held-out testing dataset and demonstrate the importance of the sampling technique described in Algorithm 2. For all quantitative results in this section, the Frechet inception distance (FID) scores [Heusel et al., 2017] for degraded and reconstructed images are measured with respect to the testing data. Additional information about the quantitative results, convergence criteria, hyperparameters, and architecture of the models presented below can be found in the appendix. 4.1 Deblurring We consider a generalized diffusion based on a Gaussian blur operation (as opposed to Gaussian noise) in which an image at stepthas more blur than att−1. The forward process given the Gaussian kernels {Gs}and the image xt−1 at step t−1 can thus be written as xt = Gt ∗xt−1 = Gt ∗... ∗G1 ∗x0 = ¯Gt ∗x0 = D(x0,t), (2) where ∗denotes the convolution operator, which blurs an image using a kernel. We train a deblurring model by minimizing the loss (1), and then use Algorithm 2 to invert this blurred diffusion process for which we trained a DNN to predict the clean image ˆx0. Qualitative results are shown in Figure 3 and quantitative results in Table 1. Qualitatively, we can see that images created using the sampling process are sharper and in some cases completely different as compared to the direct reconstruction of the clean image. Quantitatively we can see that the reconstruction metrics such as RMSE and PSNR get worse when we use the sampling process, but on the other hand FID with respect to held-out test data improves. The qualitative improvements and decrease in FID show the beneﬁts of the generalized sampling routine, which brings the learned distribution closer to the true data manifold. In the case of blur operator, the sampling routine can be thought of adding frequencies at each step. This is because the sampling routine involves the term D( ˆx0,t) −D( ˆx0,t −1) which in the case of blur becomes ¯Gt ∗x0 −¯Gt−1 ∗x0. This results in a difference of Gaussians, which is a band pass ﬁlter and contains frequencies that were removed at step t. Thus, in the sampling process, we sequentially add the frequencies that were removed during the degradation process. Degraded Direct Alg.

We remove pixels using a Gaussian mask as follows: For input images of size n×nwe start with a 2D Gaussian curve of variance β,discretized into an n×narray. We normalize so the peak of the curve has value 1, and subtract the result from 1 so the center of the mask as value 0. We randomize the location of the Gaussian mask for MNIST and CIFAR-10, but keep it centered for CelebA. We denote the ﬁnal mask by zβ. Input images x0 are iteratively masked for T steps via multiplication with a sequence of masks {zβi } with increasing βi. We can control the amount of information removed at each step by tuning the βi parameter. In the language of Section 3, D(x0,t) = x0 ·∏t i=1 zβi , where the operator ·denotes entry-wise multiplication. Figure 4 presents results on test images and compares the output of the inpainting model to the original image. The reconstructed images display reconstructed features qualitatively consistent with the context provided by the unperturbed regions of the image. We quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the inpainting models on each of the datasets by comparing distributional similarity metrics before and after the reconstruction. Our results are summarized in Table 2. Note, the FID scores here are computed with respect to the held-out validation set.

This takes place, once for each values of t, until a ﬁnal resolution is reached, 4 ×4 in the case of MNIST and CIFAR-10 and 2 ×2 in the case of Celeb-A. After each down-sampling, the lower- resolution image is resized to the original image size, using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Figure 5 presents example testing data inputs for all datasets and compares the output of the super-resolution model to the original image.

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that generalized diffusion can succeed even with exotic transforms that lack the scale-space and compositional properties of blur operators. Similar to other tasks, we degrade the images by adding snow, such that the level of snow increases with step t. We provide more implementation details in Appendix. We illustrate our desnowiﬁcation results in Figure 6. We present testing examples, as well as their snowiﬁed images, from all the datasets, and compare the desnowiﬁed results with the original images. The desnowiﬁed images feature near-perfect reconstruction results for CIFAR-10 examples with lighter snow, and exhibit visually distinctive restoration for Celeb-A examples with heavy snow. We provide quantitative results in Table 4. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 6: Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: de- graded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. 5 Cold Generation Diffusion models can successfully learn the underlying distribution of training data, and thus generate diverse, high quality images [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Jolicoeur-Martineau et al., 2021, Ho et al., 2022]. We will ﬁrst discuss deterministic generation using Gaussian noise 7Table 4: Quantitative metrics for quality of image reconstruction using desnowiﬁcation models.

Finally, we provide a proof of concept that the Algorithm 2 can be extended to other degradations. 5.1 Generation using deterministic noise degradation Here we discuss image generation using noise-based degradation. We consider “deterministic” sampling in which the noise pattern is selected and frozen at the start of the generation process, and then treated as a constant. We study two ways of applying Algorithm 2 with ﬁxed noise. We ﬁrst deﬁne D(x,t) = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz, as the (deterministic) interpolation between data point xand a ﬁxed noise pattern z∈N(0,1), for increasing αt <αt−1, ∀1 ≤t≤T as in Song et al. [2021a]. Algorithm 2 can be applied in this case by ﬁxing the noise zused in the degradation operatorD(x,s). Alternatively, one can deterministically calculate the noise vector zto be used in step tof reconstruction by using the formula ˆz(xt,t) = xt −√αtR(xt,t)√1 −αt . The second method turns out to be closely related to the deterministic sampling proposed in Song et al. [2021a], with some differences in the formulation of the training objective. We discuss this relationship in detail in Appendix A.6. We present quantitative results for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using the ﬁxed noise method and the estimated noise method (using ˆz) in Table 5. 5.2 Image generation using blur The forward diffusion process in noise-based diffusion models has the advantage that the degraded image distribution at the ﬁnal step T is simply an isotropic Gaussian. One can therefore perform (unconditional) generation by ﬁrst drawing a sample from the isotropic Gaussian, and sequentially denoising it with backward diffusion. When using blur as a degradation, the fully degraded images do not form a nice closed-form distribution that we can sample from. They do, however, form a simple enough distribution that can be modeled with simple methods. Note that every image x0 degenerates to an xT that is constant (i.e., every pixel is the same color) for largeT. Furthermore, the constant value is exactly the channel-wise mean of the RGB image x0, and can be represented with a 3-vector. This 3-dimensional distribution is easily represented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). This GMM can be sampled to produce the random pixel values of a severely blurred image, which can be deblurred using cold diffusion to create a new image. Our generative model uses a blurring schedule where we progressively blur each image with a Gaussian kernel of size 27x27 over 300 steps. The standard deviation of the kernel starts at 1 and increases exponentially at the rate of 0.01. We then ﬁt a simple GMM with one component to the distribution of channel-wise means. To generate an image from scratch, we sample the channel-wise mean from the GMM, expand the 3D vector into a 128 ×128 image with three channels, and then apply Algorithm 2. Empirically, the presented pipeline generates images with high ﬁdelity but low diversity, as reﬂected quantitatively by comparing the perfect symmetry column with results from hot diffusion in Table 5. We attribute this to the perfect correlation between pixels of xT sampled from the channel-wise mean Gaussian mixture model. To break the symmetry between pixels, we add a small amount of Gaussian noise (of standard deviation 0.002) to each sampled xT. As shown in Table 5, the simple trick drastically improves the quality of generated images. We also present the qualitative results for cold diffusion using blur transformation in Figure 7, and further discuss the necessity of Algorithm 2 8for generation in Appendix A.7. Table 5: FID scores for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using hot (using noise) and cold diffusion (using blur transformation). This table shows that This table also shows that breaking the symmetry withing pixels of the same channel further improves the FID scores.

Speciﬁcally, we show preliminary results on inpainting, super-resolution, and animorphosis. Inspired by the simplicity of the degraded image distribution for the blurring routine presented in the previous section, we use degradation routines with predictable ﬁnal distributions here as well. To use the Gaussian mask transformation for generation, we modify the masking routine so the ﬁnal degraded image is completely devoid of information. One might think a natural option is to send all of the images to a completely black image xT, but this would not allow for any diversity in generation. To get around this maximally non-injective property, we instead make the mask turn all pixels to a random, solid color. This still removes all of the information from the image, but it allows us to recover different samples from the learned distribution via Algorithm 2 by starting off with different color images. More formally, a Gaussian mask Gt = ∏t i=1 zβi is created in a similar way as discussed in the Section 4.2, but instead of multiplying it directly to the image x0, we create xt as follows: xt = Gt ∗x0 + (1 −Gt) ∗c where cis an image of a randomly sampled color. For super-resolution, the routine down-samples to a resolution of 2 ×2, or 4 values in each channel. These degraded images can be represented as one-dimensional vectors, and their distribution is modeled using one Gaussian distribution. Using the same methods described for generation using 9blurring described above, we sample from this Gaussian-ﬁtted distribution of the lower-dimensional degraded image space and pass this sampled point through the generation process trained on super- resolution data to create one output. Additionally to show one can invert nearly any transformation, we include a new transformation deemed animorphosis, where we iteratively transform a human face from CelebA to an animal face from AFHQ. Though we chose CelebA and AFHQ for our experimentation, in principle such interpolation can be done for any two initial data distributions. More formally, given an image xand a random image zsampled from the AFHQ manifold, xt can be written as follows: xt = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz Note this is essentially the same as the noising procedure, but instead of adding noise we are adding a progressively higher weighted AFHQ image. In order to sample from the learned distribution, we sample a random image of an animal and use Algorithm 2 to reverse theanimorphosis transformation. We present results for the CelebA dataset, and hence the quantitative results in terms of FID scores for inpainting, super-resolution and animorphosis are 90.14, 92.91 and 48.51 respectively. We further show some qualitative samples in Figure 8, and in Figure 1. Figure 8: Preliminary demonstration of the generative abilities of other cold diffusins on the128×128 CelebA dataset. The top row is with animorphosis models, the middle row is with inpainting models, and the bottom row exhibits super-resolution models. 6 Conclusion Existing diffusion models rely on Gaussian noise for both forward and reverse processes. In this work, we ﬁnd that the random noise can be removed entirely from the diffusion model framework, and replaced with arbitrary transforms. In doing so, our generalization of diffusion models and their sampling procedures allows us to restore images afﬂicted by deterministic degradations such as blur, inpainting and downsampling. This framework paves the way for a more diverse landscape of diffusion models beyond the Gaussian noise paradigm. The different properties of these diffusions may prove useful for a range of applications, including image generation and beyond. References Shane Barratt and Rishi Sharma.

LOGAN: latent optimisation for generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00953, 2019. 12A Appendix A.1 Deblurring For the deblurring experiments, we train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The training was done on the batch size of 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995 which is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For the MNIST dataset, we blur recursively 40 times, with a discrete Gaussian kernel of size 11x11 and a standard deviation 7. In the case of CIFAR-10, we recursively blur with a Gaussian kernel of ﬁxed size 11x11, but at each step t, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is given by 0.01 ∗t+ 0.35. The blur routine for CelebA dataset involves blurring images with a Gaussian kernel of 15x15 and the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel grows exponentially with time tat the rate of 0.01. Figure 9 shows an additional nine images for each of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Figures 19 and 20 show the iterative sampling process using a deblurring model for ten example images from each dataset. We further show 400 random images to demonstrate the qualitative results in the Figure 21. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 9: Additional examples from deblurring models trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. A.2 Inpainting For the inpainting transformation, models were trained on different datasets with 60,000 gradient steps. The models were trained using Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2×10−5. We use batch size 64, and the gradients are accumulated after every 2 steps. The ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. This EMA model is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For all our inpainting experiments we use a randomized Gaussian mask and T = 50 with β1 = 1 and βi+1 = βi + 0.1. To avoid potential leakage of information due to ﬂoating point computation of the Gaussian mask, we discretize the masked image before passing it through the inpainting model. This was done by rounding all pixel values to the eight most signiﬁcant digits. 13Figure 11 shows nine additional inpainting examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 10 demonstrates an example of the iterative sampling process of an inpainting model for one image in each dataset. A.3 Super-Resolution We train the super-resolution model per Section 3.1 for 700,000 iterations. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The batch size is 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. The number of time-steps depends on the size of the input image and the ﬁnal image. For MNIST and for CIFAR10, the number of time steps is 3, as it takes three steps of halving the resolution to reduce the initial image down to 4 ×4. For CelebA, the number of time steps is 6 to reduce the initial image down to 2 ×2. For CIFAR10, we apply random crop and random horizontal ﬂip for regularization. Figure 13 shows an additional nine super-resolution examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 12 shows one example of the progressive increase in resolution achieved with the sampling process using a super-resolution model for each dataset. A.4 Colorization Here we provide results for the additional task of colorization. Starting with the original RGB- image x0, we realize colorization by iteratively desaturating for T steps until the ﬁnal image xT is a fully gray-scale image. We use a series of three-channel 1 ×1 convolution ﬁlters z(α) = {z1(α),z2(α),z3(α)}with the form z1(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (1 0 0) z2(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 1 0) z3(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 0 1) and obtain D(x,t) = z(αt) ∗xvia a schedule deﬁned as α1,...,α t for each respective step. Notice that a gray image is obtained when xT = z(1) ∗x0. We can tune the ratio αt to control the amount of information removed in each step. For our experiment, we schedule the ratio such that for every twe have xt = z(αt) ∗... ∗z(α1) ∗x0 = z( t T) ∗x0. This schedule ensures that color information lost between steps is smaller in earlier stage of the diffusion and becomes larger as tincreases. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 50 and for CelebA we use T = 20.

We illustrate our recolorization results in Figure 14. We present testing examples, as well as their grey scale images, from all the datasets, and compare the recolorization results with the original images. The recolored images feature correct color separation between different regions, and feature various and yet semantically correct colorization of objects. Our sampling technique still yields minor differences in comparison to the direct reconstruction, although the change is not visually apparent. We attribute this to the shape restriction of colorization task, as human perception is rather insensitive to minor color change. We also provide quantitative measurement for the effectiveness of our recolorization results in terms of different similarity metrics, and summarize the results in Table 6.

A.5 Image Snow Here we provide results for the additional task of snowiﬁcation, which is a direct adaptation of the ofﬁcal implementation of ImageNet-C snowiﬁcation process [Hendrycks and Dietterich, 2019]. To determine the snow pattern of a given image x0 ∈RC×H×W, we ﬁrst construct a seed matrix SA ∈RH×W where each entry is sampled from a Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ). The upper-left corner of SA is then zoomed into another matrix SB ∈RH×W with spline interpolation. Next, we create a new matrix SC by ﬁltering each value of SB with a given threshold c1 as SC[i][j] = {0, S B[i][j] ≤c1 SB[i][j], S B[i][j] >c1 and clip each entry of SC into the range [0,1]. We then convolve SC using a motion blur kernel with standard deviation c2 to create the snow pattern Sand its up-side-down rotation S′. The direction of the motional blur kernel is randomly chosen as either vertical or horizontal. The ﬁnal snow image is 16created by again clipping each value of x0 + S+ S′into the range [0,1]. For simplicity, we abstract the process as a function h(x0,SA,c0,c1). Degraded Direct Alg.

Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. To create a series ofT images with increasing snowiﬁcation, we linearly interpolatec0 and c1 between [cstart 0 ,cend 0 ] and [cstart 1 ,cend 1 ] respectively, to create c0(t) and c1(t), t= 1,...,T . Then for each x0, a seed matrix Sx is sampled, the motion blur direction is randomized, and we construct each related xt by xt = h(x0,Sx,c0(t),c1(t)). Visually, c0(t) dictates the severity of the snow, while c1(t) determines how “windy\" the snowiﬁed image seems. For both CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A, we use the same Gaussian distribution with parameters µ= 0.55 and σ = 0 .3 to generate the seed matrix. For CIFAR-10, we choose cstart 0 = 1 .15, cend 0 = 0 .7, cstart 1 = 0 .05 and cend 1 = 16 , which generates a visually lighter snow. For Celeb-A, we choose cstart 0 = 1.15, cend 0 = 0.55, cstart 1 = 0.05 and cend 1 = 20, which generates a visually heavier snow. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 200 and for CelebA we use T = 200. We note that the seed matrix is resampled for each individual training batch, and hence the snow pattern varies across the training stage. A.6 Generation using noise : Further Details Here we will discuss in further detail on the similarity between the sampling method proposed in Algorithm 2 and the deterministic sampling in DDIM [Song et al., 2021a]. Given the image xt at step t, we have the restored clean image ˆx0 from the diffusion model. Hence given the estimated ˆx0 and xt, we can estimate the noise z(xt,t) (or ˆz) as z(xt,t) = xt −√αt ˆx0√1 −αt , Thus, the D( ˆx0,t) and D( ˆx0,t −1) can be written as D( ˆx0,t) = √αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz, D( ˆx0,t −1) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz, using which the sampling process in Algorithm 2 to estimate xt−1 can be written as, 17xt−1 = xt −D( ˆx0,t) + D( ˆx0,t −1) = xt −(√αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz) + (√αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz (3) which is same as the sampling method as described in [Song et al., 2021a]. A.7 Generation using blur transformation: Further Details Figure 16: Examples of generated samples from 128×128 CelebA and AFHQ datasets using Method 2 with perfect symmetry. The Figure 16, shows the generation without breaking any symmetry within each channel are quite promising as well. Necessity of Algorithm 2: In the case of unconditional generation, we observe a marked superiority in quality of the sampled reconstruction using Algorithm 2 over any other method considered. For example, in the broken symmetry case, the FID of the directly reconstructed images is 257.69 for CelebA and 214.24 for AFHQ, which are far worse than the scores of 49.45 and 54.68 from Table 5. In Figure 17, we also give a qualitative comparison of this difference. We can also clearly see from Figure 18 that Algorithm 1, the method used in Song et al. [2021b] and Ho et al. [2020], completely fails to produce an image close to the target data distribution. 18Figure 17: Comparison of direct reconstruction with sampling using Algorithm 2 for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry.

Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models. 1 Introduction In recent years, diffusion models [1–4] have become one of the leading generative models, powering the state-of-the-art image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion [5]. To understand the empirical success of diffusion models, several works [6–12] have focused on their sampling behavior, showing that the data distribution can be effectively estimated in the reverse sampling process, assuming that the score function is learned accurately. Meanwhile, other works [ 13–18] investigate the learning of score functions, showing that effective approximation can be achieved with score matching loss under certain assumptions. However, these theoretical insights, grounded in simplified assumptions about data distribution and neural network architectures, do not fully capture the complex dynamics of diffusion models in practical scenarios. One significant discrepancy between theory and practice is that real-world diffusion models are trained only on a finite number of data points. As argued in [19], theoretically a perfectly learned score function over the empirical data distribution can only replicate the training data. In contrast, diffusion models trained on finite samples exhibit remarkable generalizability, producing high-quality images that significantly differ from the training examples. Therefore, a good understanding of the remarkable generative power of diffusion models is still lacking. In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of generalizability in diffusion models by analyzing the inherent properties of the learned score functions. Essentially, the score functions can be interpreted as a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. These denoisers are then 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2410.24060v5  [cs.LG]  2 Dec 2024chained together to progressively denoise a randomly sampled Gaussian noise into its corresponding clean image, thus, understanding the function mappings of these diffusion denoisers is critical to demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Motivated by the linearity observed in the diffusion denoisers of effectively generalized diffusion models, we propose to elucidate their function mappings with a linear distillation approach, where the resulting linear models serve as the linear approximations of their nonlinear counterparts. Contributions of this work: Our key findings can be highlighted as follows: • Inductive bias towards Gaussian structures (Section 3). Diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close (but not equal) to the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training data. This implies the diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training data for image generation. • Model Capacity and Training Duration (Section 4) We show that this inductive bias is most pronounced when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of the training data. However, even if the model is highly overparameterized, such inductive bias still emerges during early training phases, before the model memorizes its training data. This implies that early stopping can prompt generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. • Connection between Strong Generalization and Gaussian Structure (Section 5). Lastly, we argue that the recently observed strong generalization [20] results from diffusion models learning certain common low-dimensional structural features shared across non-overlapping datasets. We show that such low-dimensional features can be partially explained through the Gaussian structure. Relationship with Prior Arts. Recent research [20–24] demonstrates that diffusion models operate in two distinct regimes: ( i) a memorization regime, where models primarily reproduce training samples and (ii) a generalization regime, where models generate high-quality, novel images that extend beyond the training data. In the generalization regime, a particularly intriguing phenomenon is that diffusion models trained on non-overlapping datasets can generate nearly identical samples [20]. While prior work [20] attributes this ”strong generalization” effect to the structural inductive bias inherent in diffusion models leading to the optimal denoising basis (geometry-adaptive harmonic basis), our research advances this understanding by demonstrating diffusion models’ inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure of the training data. Our findings also corroborate with observations of earlier study [25] that the learned score functions of well-trained diffusion models closely align with the optimal score functions of a multivariate Gaussian approximation of the training data. 2 Preliminary Basics of Diffusion Models. Given a data distribution pdata(x), where x ∈ Rd, diffusion mod- els [1–4] define a series of intermediate states p(x; σ(t)) by adding Gaussian noise sampled from N(0, σ(t)2I) to the data, where σ(t) is a predefined schedule that specifies the noise level at time t ∈ [0, T], such that at the end stage the noise mollified distribution p(x; σ(T)) is indistinguishable from the pure Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, a new sample is generated by progressively denoising a random noise xT ∼ N(0, σ(T)2I) to its corresponding clean image x0. Following [4], this forward and backward diffusion process can be expressed with a probabilistic ODE: dx = −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇x log p(x; σ(t))dt. (1) In practice the score function ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) can be approximated by ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) = (Dθ(x; σ(t)) − x)/σ(t)2, (2) where Dθ(x; σ(t)) is parameterized by a deep network with parameters θ trained with the denoising score matching objective: min θ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I) \u0002 ∥Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − x∥2 2 \u0003 . (3) In the discrete setting, the reverse ODE in (1) takes the following form: xi+1 ← (1 − (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti))xi + (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti)Dθ(xi; σ(ti)), (4) 2where x0 ∼ N(0, σ2(t0)I). Notice that at each iteration i, the intermediate sample xi+1 is the sum of the scaled xi and the denoising output Dθ(xi; σ(ti)). Obviously, the final sampled image is largely determined by the denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)). If we can understand the function mapping of these diffusion denoisers, we can demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Optimal Diffusion Denoisers under Simplified Data Assumptions. Under certain assumptions on the data distribution pdata(x), the optimal diffusion denoisers Dθ(x; σ(t)) that minimize the score matching objective (3) can be derived analytically in closed-forms as we discuss below. • Multi-delta distribution of the training data. Suppose the training dataset contains a finite number of data points {y1, y2, ...,yN }, a natural way to model the data distribution is to represent it as a multi-delta distribution: p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi). In this case, the optimal denoiser is DM(x; σ(t)) = PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I)yi PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I) , (5) which is essentially a softmax-weighted combination of the finite data points. As proved in [24], such diffusion denoisers DM(x; σ(t)) can only generate exact replicas of the training samples, therefore they have no generalizability. • Multivariate Gaussian distribution. Recent work [ 25] suggests modeling the data distribution pdata(x) as a multivariate Gaussian distribution p(x) = N(µ, Σ), where the mean µ and the co- variance Σ are approximated by the empirical mean µ = 1 N PN i=1 yi and the empirical covariance Σ = 1 N PN i=1(yi − µ)(yi − µ)T of the training dataset. In this case, the optimal denoiser is: DG(x; σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), (6) where Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values Λ = diag (λ1, ··· , λd) and ˜Λσ(t) = diag \u0010 λ1 λ1+σ(t)2 , ··· , λd λd+σ(t)2 \u0011 . With this linear Gaus- sian denoiser, as proved in [25], the sampling trajectory of the probabilistic ODE (1) has close form: xt = µ + dX i=1 s σ(t)2 + λi σ(T)2 + λi uT i (xT − µ)ui, (7) where ui is the ith singular vector of the empirical covariance matrix. While [ 25] demonstrate that the Gaussian scores approximate learned scores at high noise variances, we show that they are nearly the best linear approximations of learned scores across a much wider range of noise variances. Generalization vs. Memorization of Diffusion Models. As the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images [17]. While memorization can be interpreted as an overfitting of diffusion models to the training samples, the mechanisms underlying the generalization regime remain less well understood. This study aims to explore and elucidate the inductive bias that enables effective generalization in diffusion models. 3 Hidden Linear and Gaussian Structures in Diffusion Models In this section, we study the intrinsic structures of the learned score functions of diffusion models in the generalization regime. Through various experiments and theoretical investigation, we show that Diffusion models in the generalization regime have inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structures of the dataset. Based on the linearity observed in diffusion denoisers trained in the generalization regime, we propose to investigate their intrinsic properties through a linear distillation technique, with which we train a series of linear models to approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers (Section 3.1). Interestingly, these linear models closely resemble the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset (Section 3.2). This implies diffusion models have the inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structure of the 3training dataset. We theoretically show that the observed Gaussian structure is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the constraint that the model is linear (Section 3.3). In the subsequent sections, although we mainly demonstrate our results using the FFHQ datasets, our findings are robust and extend to various architectures and datasets, as detailed in Appendix G. 3.1 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime Our study is motivated by the emerging linearity observed in diffusion models in the generalization regime. Specifically, we quantify the linearity of diffusion denoisers at various noise levelσ(t) by jointly assessing their ”Additivity” and ”Homogeneity” with a linearity score (LS) defined by the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)): LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , where x1, x2 ∼ p(x; σ(t)), and α ∈ R and β ∈ R are scalars. In practice, the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 samples. A more detailed discussion on this choice of measuring linearity is deferred to Appendix A. Figure 1: Linearity scores of diffusion denoisers. Solid and dashed lines depict the linearity scores across noise variances for models in the general- ization and memorization regimes, respectively, where α = β = 1/ √ 2. Following the EDM training configuration [4], we set the noise levels σ(t) within the contin- uous range [0.002,80]. As shown in Figure 1, as diffusion models transition from the mem- orization regime to the generalization regime (increasing the training dataset size), the corre- sponding diffusion denoisers Dθ exhibit increas- ing linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets1 as well as various training con- figurations2; see Appendix B for more details. This emerging linearity motivates us to ask the following questions: • To what extent can a diffusion model be ap- proximated by a linear model? • If diffusion models can be approximated lin- early, what are the underlying characteristics of this linear approximation? Investigating the Linear Structures via Linear Distillation. To address these questions, we investigate the hidden linear structure of diffusion denoisers through linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiserDθ(x; σ(t)) at noise levelσ(t), we approximate it with a linear function (with a bias term) such that: DL(x; σ(t)) := Wσ(t)x + bσ(t) ≈ Dθ(x; σ(t)), ∀x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), (8) where the weight Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d and bias bσ(t) ∈ Rd are learned by solving the following optimiza- tion problem with gradient descent:3 min Wσ(t),bσ(t) Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||Wσ(t)(x + ϵ) + bσ(t) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))||2 2. (9) If these linear models effectively approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers, analyzing their weights can elucidate the generation mechanism. While diffusion models are trained on continuous noise variance levels within [0.002,80], we examine the 10 discrete sampling steps specified by the EDM schedule [4]: [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002] . These steps are considered sufficient for studying the diffusion mappings for two reasons: (i) images generated using these 10 steps closely match those generated 1For example, FFHQ [26], CIFAR-10 [27], AFHQ [28] and LSUN-Churches [29]. 2For example, EDM-VE, EDM-VP and EDM-ADM. 3For the following, the input is the vectorized version of the noisy image and the expectation is approximated using finite samples of input-output pairs (xi + ϵi, Dθ(xi + ϵ, σ(t))) with i = 1, ..., N(see distillation details in Appendix C). 4Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) Figure 2: Score field approximation error and sampling Trajectory. The left and right figures demonstrate the score field approximation error and the sampling trajectories D(xt; σ(t) of actual diffusion model (EDM), Multi-Delta model, linear model and Gaussian model respectively. Notice that the curve corresponding to the Gaussian model almost overlaps with that of the linear model, suggesting they share similar funciton mappings. with more steps, and (ii) recent research [30] demonstrates that the diffusion denoisers trained on similar noise variances exhibit analogous function mappings, implying that denoiser behavior at discrete variances represents their behavior at nearby variances. After obtaining the linear modelsDL, we evaluate their differences with the actual nonlinear denoisers Dθ with the score field approximation error, calculated using the expectation over the root mean square error (RMSE): Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) r ∥DL(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))∥2 2 d| {z } RMSE of a pair of randomly sampled x and ϵ , (10) where d represents the data dimension and the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean. While we present RMSE-based results in the main text, our findings remain consistent across alternative metrics, including NMSE, as detailed in Appendix G. We perform linear distillation on well trained diffusion models operating in the generalization regime. For comprehensive analysis, we also compute the score approximation error between Dθ and: (i) the optimal denoisers for the multi-delta distribution DM defined as (5), and (ii) the optimal denoisers for the multivariate Gaussian distribution DG defined as (6). As shown in Figure 2, our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [20,80]. In this regime, only coarse image structures are generated (Fig- ure 2(right)). Quantitatively, as shown in Figure 2(left), the distilled linear model DL closely approximates its nonlinear counterpart Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. Both Gaussian score DG and multi-delta score DM also achieve comparable approximation accuracy. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, only subtle, imperceptible details are added to the generated images. Here, both DL and DG effectively approximate Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,20]: This crucial regime, where realistic image content is primarily generated, exhibits significant nonlinearity. While DM exhibits high approximation error due to rapid convergence to training samples—a memorization effect theoretically proved in [24], both DL and DG maintain relatively lower approximation errors. Qualitatively, as shown in Figure 2(right), despite the relatively high score approximation error in the intermediate noise regime, the images generated with DL closely resemble those generated with Dθ in terms of the overall image structure and certain amount of fine details. This implies (i) the underlying linear structure within the nonlinear diffusion models plays a pivotal role in their generalization capabilities and (ii) such linear structure is effectively captured by our distilled linear models. In the next section, we will explore this linear structure by examining the linear models DL. 3.2 Inductive Bias towards Learning the Gaussian Structures Notably, the Gaussian denoisers DG exhibit behavior strikingly similar to the linear denoisers DL. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), they achieve nearly identical score approximation errors, particularly 5Correlation Matrices !0123456 ! ‖\"!(#)−$\t&'!#$2‖&/‖$7Λ!#$2‖& Figure 4: Linear model shares similar function mapping with Gaussian model.

The right figure shows the correlation matrices between the first 100 singular vectors of the linear weights and Gaussian weights. in the critical intermediate variance region. Furthermore, their sampling trajectories are remarkably similar (Figure 2(right)), producing nearly identical generated images that closely match those from the actual diffusion denoisers (Figure 3). These observations suggest that DL and DG share similar function mappings across various noise levels, leading us to hypothesize that the intrinsic linear structure underlying diffusion models corresponds to the Gaussian structure of the training data—specifically, its empirical mean and covariance. We validate this hypothesis by empirically showing that DL is close to DG through the following three complementary experiments: • Similarity in weight matrices. As illustrated in Figure 4(left), Wσ(t) progressively converge towards U ˜Λσ(t)UT throughout the linear distillation process, achieving small normalized MSE (less than 0.2) for most of the noise levels. The less satisfactory convergence behavior at σ(t) = 80.0 is due to inadequate training of the diffusion models at this particular noise level, which is minimally sampled during the training of actual diffusion models (see Appendix G.2 for more details). Figure 3: Images sampled from vari- ous Models. The figure shows the sam- ples generated using different models starting from the same initial noises. • Similarity in Score functions. Furthermore, Figure 2(left, gray line) demonstrates that DL and DG maintain small score differences (RMSE less than 0.05) across all noise levels, indicating that these denoisers exhibit similar func- tion mappings throughout the diffusion process. • Similarity in principal components. As shown in Fig- ure 4(right), for a wide noise range (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0]), the leading singular vectors of the linear weights Wσ(t) (denoted ULinear) align well withU, the singular vectors of the Gaussian weights.4 This implies that U, representing the principal components of the training data, is effectively captured by the diffusion models. In the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]), however, Dθ approximates the identity mapping, leading to ambiguous singular vectors with minimal impact on image generation. Further analy- sis of Dθ’s behavior in the low-noise regime is provided in Appendices D and F.1. Since the optimization problem (9) is convex w.r.t. Wσ(t) and bσ(t), the optimal solution DL represents the unique optimal linear approximation of Dθ. Our analyses demonstrate that this optimal linear approximation closely aligns with DG, leading to our central finding: diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias (which we term as the Gaussian inductive bias) towards learning the Gaussian structure of training data. This manifests in two main ways: ( i) In the high-noise variance regime, well-trained diffusion models learn Dθ that closely approximate the linear Gaussian denoisers DG; (ii) As noise variance decreases, although Dθ diverges from DG, DG remains nearly identical to the optimal linear approximation DL, and images generated by DG retain structural similarity to those generated by Dθ. Finally, we emphasize that the Gaussian inductive bias only emerges in the generalization regime. By contrast, in the memorization regime, Figure 5 shows that DL significantly diverges from DG, and 4For σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0], the less well recovered singular vectors have singular values close to 0, whereas those corresponding to high singular values are well recovered. 6Clean Image!Noise\"∼.(/,&'#1)#=!+\" )!(\";&(')) )\"(\";&('))(70000))\"(\";&('))(35000))\"(\";&('))(1094))\"(\";&('))(68) )!(#;&(')) )\"(#;&('))(70000))\"(#;&('))(35000))\"(#;&('))(1094))\"(#;&('))(68) Denoising Outputs  for !\"=4 MemorizationGeneralization(a) (b) Figure 5: Comparison between the diffusion denoisers in memorization and generalization regimes. Figure(a) demonstrates that in the memorization regime (trained on small datasets of size 1094 and 68), DL significantly diverges from DG, and both provide substantially poorer approxima- tions of Dθ compared to the generalization regime (trained on larger datasets of size 35000 and 1094). Figure(b) qualitatively shows that the denoising outputs of Dθ closely match those of DG only in the generalization regime—a similarity that persists even when the denoisers process pure noise inputs. both DG and DL provide considerably poorer approximations of Dθ compared to the generalization regime. 3.3 Theoretical Analysis In this section, we demonstrate that imposing linear constraints on diffusion models while minimizing the denoising score matching objective (3) leads to the emergence of Gaussian structure. Theorem 1. Consider a diffusion denoiser parameterized as a single-layer linear network, defined as D(xt; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)xt + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is a linear weight matrix and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias vector. When the data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ, the optimal solution to the score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser defined in (6): DG(xt; σ(t)) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT (xt − µ) + µ, with Wσ(t) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT and bσ(t) = \u0010 I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT \u0011 µ. The detailed proof is postponed to Appendix E. This optimal solution corresponds to the classical Wiener filter [ 31], revealing that diffusion models naturally learn the Gaussian denoisers when constrained to linear architectures. To understand why highly nonlinear diffusion models operate near this linear regime, it is helpful to model the training data distribution as the multi-delta distribution p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi), where {y1, y2, ...,yN } is the finite training images. Notice that this formulation better reflects practical scenarios where only a finite number of training samples are available rather than the ground truth data distribution. Importantly, it is proved in [ 25] that the optimal denoisers DM in this case is approximately equivalent to DG for high noise variance σ(t) and query points far from the finite training data. This equivalence explains the strong similarity between DG and DM in the high-noise variance regime, and consequently, why Dθ and DG exhibit high similarity in this regime—deep networks converge to the optimal denoisers for finite training datasets. However, this equivalence betweenDG and DM breaks down at lower σ(t) values. The denoising outputs of DM are convex combinations of training data points, weighted by a softmax function with temperature σ(t)2. As σ(t)2 decreases, this softmax function increasingly approximates an argmax function, effectively retrieving the training point yi closest to the input x. Learning this optimal solution requires not only sufficient model capacity to memorize the entire training dataset but also, as shown in [32], an exponentially large number of training samples. Due to these learning challenges, deep networks instead converge to local minimaDθ that, while differing fromDM, exhibit better generalization property. Our experiments reveal that these learned Dθ share similar function mappings with DG. The precise mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question for future research. 7MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 6: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structure when training dataset is large. Models with a fixed scale (channel size 128) are trained across various dataset sizes. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. ”NN” denotes the nearest neighbor in the training dataset to the images generated by the diffusion models. Notably, modeling pdata(x) as a multi-delta distribution reveals a key insight: while unconstrained optimal denoisers (5) perfectly capture the scores of the empirical distribution, they have no gen- eralizability. In contrast, Gaussian denoisers, despite having higher score approximation errors due to the linear constraint, can generate novel images that closely match those produced by the actual diffusion models. This suggests that the generative power of diffusion models stems from the imperfect learning of the score functions of the empirical distribution. 4 Conditions for the Emergence of Gaussian Structures and Generalizability In Section 3, we demonstrate that diffusion models exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers that are close to the Gaussian denoisers. In this section, we investigate the conditions under which this bias manifests. Our findings reveal that this inductive bias is linked to model generalization and is governed by (i) the model capacity relative to the dataset size and (ii) the training duration. For additional results, including experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, see Appendix F. 4.1 Gaussian Structures Emerge when Model Capacity is Relatively Small First, we find that the Gaussian inductive bias and the generalization of diffusion models are heavily influenced by the relative size of the model capacity compared to the training dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of training dataset. This argument is supported by the following two key observations: • Increasing dataset size prompts the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed model scale. We train diffusion models using the EDM configuration [4] with a fixed channel size of 128 on datasets of varying sizes [68, 137, 1094, 8750, 35000, 70000] until FID convergence. Figure 6(left) demonstrates that the score approximation error between diffusion denoisers Dθ and Gaussian denoisers DG decreases as the training dataset size grows, particularly in the crucial intermediate noise variance regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]). This increasing similarity between Dθ and DG correlates with a transition in the models’ behavior: from a memorization regime, where generated images are replicas of training samples, to a generalization regime, where novel images exhibiting Gaussian structure5 are produced, as shown in Figure 6(b). This correlation underscores the critical role of Gaussian structure in the generalization capabilities of diffusion models. • Decreasing model capacity promotes the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed dataset sizes. Next, we investigate the impact of model scale by training diffusion models with varying channel sizes [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], corresponding to[64k, 251k, 992k, 4M, 16M, 64M] parameters, on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. Figure 7(left) shows that in the intermediate noise variance regime 5We use the term ”exhibiting Gaussian structure” to describe images that resemble those generated by Gaussian denoisers. 8GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 7: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure when model scale is small. Models with different scales are trained on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 8: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Diffusion model with same scale (channel size 128) is trained using 1094 images. The left and right figures shows the score difference and the generated images respectively. (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]), the discrepancy between Dθ and DG decreases with decreasing model scale, indicating that Gaussian structure emerges in low-capacity models. Figure 7(right) demonstrates that this trend corresponds to a transition from data memorization to the generation of images exhibiting Gaussian structure. Here we note that smaller models lead to larger discrepancy between Dθ and DG in the high-noise regime. This phenomenon arises because diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances, especially when model capacity is limited (see more details in Appendix F.2). These two experiments collectively suggest that the inductive bias of diffusion models is governed by the relative capacity of the model compared to the training dataset size. 4.2 Overparameterized Models Learn Gaussian Structures before Memorization In the overparameterized regime, where model capacity significantly exceeds training dataset size, diffusion models eventually memorize the training data when trained to convergence. However, examining the learning progression reveals a key insight: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures with generalizability before they memorize. Figure 8(a) demonstrates that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ progressively converge to DG in the intermediate noise variance regime, indicating that the diffusion model is progressively learning the Gaussian structure in the initial stages of training. Notably. By epoch 841, the diffusion model generates images strongly resembling those produced by the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 8(b). However, continued training beyond this point increases the difference between Dθ and DG as the model transitions toward memorization. This observation suggests that early stopping could be an effective strategy for promoting generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. 9Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 35000, model scale 128 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 35000) Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 1094) Non-overlapping datasets with size 1094, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 8 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (1094) Figure 9: Diffusion models in the strong generalization regime generate similar images as the Gaussian models.

Figure(b) Top: Generated images of Gausisan model; Bottom: Generated images of diffusion models in the memorization regime, with model scale 128; S1 and S2 each has 1094 non-overlapping images. Figure(c): Early stopping and reducing model capacity help transition diffusion models from memorization to generalization. 5 Connection between Strong Generalizability and Gaussian Structure A recent study [ 20] reveals an intriguing ”strong generalization” phenomenon: diffusion models trained on large, non-overlapping image datasets generate nearly identical images from the same initial noise. While this phenomenon might be attributed to deep networks’ inductive bias towards learning the ”true” continuous distribution of photographic images, we propose an alternative explanation: rather than learning the complete distribution, deep networks may capture certain low-dimensional common structural features shared across these datasets and these features can be partially explained by the Gaussian structure. To validate this hypothesis, we examine two diffusion models with channel size 128, trained on non-overlapping datasets S1 and S2 (35000 images each). Figure 9(a) shows that images generated by these models (bottom) closely match those from their corresponding Gaussian models (top), highlighting the Gaussian structure’s role in strong generalization. Comparing Figure 9(a)(top) and (b)(top), we observe that DG generates nearly identical images whether the Gaussian structure is calculated on a small dataset (1094 images) or a much larger one (35000 images). This similarity emerges because datasets of the same class can exhibit similar Gaussian structure (empirical covariance) with relatively few samples—just hundreds for FFHQ. Given the Gaussian structure’s critical role in generalization, small datasets may already contain much of the information needed for generalization, contrasting previous assertions in [20] that strong generalization requires training on datasets of substantial size (more than 105 images). However, smaller datasets increase memorization risk, as shown in Figure 9(b). To mitigate this, as discussed in Section 4, we can either reduce model capacity or implement early stopping (Figure 9(c)). Indeed, models trained on 1094 and 35000 images generate remarkably similar images, though the smaller dataset yields lower perceptual quality. This similarity further demonstrates that small datasets contain substantial generalization-relevant information closely tied to Gaussian structure. Further discussion on the connections and differences between our work and [20] are detailed in Appendix H. 6 Discussion In this study, we empirically demonstrate that diffusion models in the generalization regime have the inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close to the corresponding linear Gaussian denoisers. Although real-world image distributions are significantly different from Gaussian, our findings imply that diffusion models have the bias towards learning and utilizing low-dimensional data structures, such as the data covariance, for image generation. However, the underlying mechanism by which the nonlinear diffusion models, trained with gradient descent, exhibit such linearity remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Moreover, the Gaussian structure only partially explains diffusion models’ generalizability. While models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, a substan- tial gap persists between the linear Gaussian denoisers and the actual nonlinear diffusion models, especially in the intermediate noise regime. As a result, images generated by Gaussian denoisers fall 10short in perceptual quality compared to those generated by the actual diffusion models especially for complex dataset such as CIFAR-10. This disparity highlights the critical role of nonlinearity in high-quality image generation, a topic we aim to investigate further in future research.

For a diffusion denoiser, Dθ(x; σ(t)), to be considered approximately linear, it must fulfill the following conditions: • Additivity: The function should satisfy Dθ(x1 + x2; σ(t)) ≈ Dθ(x1; σ(t)) + Dθ(x2; σ(t)). • Homogeneity: It should also adhere to Dθ(αx; σ(t)) ≈ αDθ(x; σ(t)). To jointly assess these properties, we propose to measure the difference betweenDθ(αx1+βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)). While the linearity score is introduced as the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)) in the main text: LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , (11) it can also be defined with the normalized mean square difference (NMSE): Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) − (αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)))||2 ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))||2 , (12) where the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 randomly sampled pairs of (x1, x2). In the next section, we will demonstrate the linearity score with both metrics. Since the diffusion denoisers are trained solely on inputs x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), their behaviors on out- of-distribution inputs can be quite irregular. To produce a denoised output with meaningful image structure, it is critical that the noise component in the input x matches the correct variance σ(t)2. Therefore, our analysis of linearity is restricted to in-distribution inputs x1 and x2, which are randomly sampled images with additive Gaussian noises calibrated to noise variance σ(t)2. We also need to ensure that the values of α and β are chosen such that α2 + β2 = 1, maintaining the correct variance for the noise term in the combined input αx1 + βx2. We present the linearity scores, calculated with varying values of α and β, for diffusion models trained on diverse datasets in Figure 10. These models are trained with the EDM-VE configuration proposed in [4], which ensures the resulting models are in the generalization regime. Typically, setting α = β = 1/ √ 2 yields the lowest linearity score; however, even in this scenario, the cosine similarity remains impressively high, exceeding 0.96. This high value underscores the presence of significant linearity within diffusion denoisers. We would like to emphasize that for linearity to manifest in diffusion denoisers, it is crucial that they are well-trained, achieving a low denoising score matching loss as indicated in (3). As shown in Figure 11, the linearity notably reduces in a less well trained diffusion model (Baseline-VE) comapred to its well-trained counterpart (EDM-VE). Although both models utilize the same ’VE’ network architecture Fθ(x; σ(t)) [2], they differ in how the diffusion denoisers are parameterized: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), (13) 15where cskip is the skip connection and cout modulate the scale of the network output. With carefully tailored cskip and cout, the EDM-VE configuration achieves a lower score matching loss compared to Baseline-VE, resulting in samples with higher quality as illustrated in Figure 11(right). B Emerging Linearity of Diffusion Models In this section we provide a detailed discussion on the observation that diffusion models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, which is briefly described in Section 3.1. B.1 Generalization and Memorization Regimes of Diffusion Models As shown in Figure 12, as the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images. To measure the generalization capabilities of diffusion models, it is crucial to assess their ability to generate images that are not mere replications of the training dataset. This can be quantitatively evaluated by generating a large set of images from the diffusion model and measuring the average difference between these generated images and their nearest neighbors in the training set. Specifically, let {x1, x2, ...,xk} represent k randomly sampled images from the diffusion models (we choose k = 100 in our experiments), and let Y := {y1, y2, ...,yN } denote the training dataset consisting of N images. We define the generalization score as follows: GL Score := 1 k kX i=1 ||xi − NNY (xi)||2 ||xi||2 (14) where NNY (xi) represents the nearest neighbor of the samplexk in the training datasetY , determined by the Euclidean distance on a per-pixel basis. Empirically, a GL score exceeding 0.6 indicates that the diffusion models are effectively generalizing beyond the training dataset. B.2 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime As demonstrated in Figure 13(a) and (d), diffusion models transition from the memorization regime to the generalization regime as the training dataset size increases. Concurrently, as depicted in Fig- ure 13(b), (c), (e) and (f), the corresponding diffusion denoisers exhibit increasingly linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets datasets including FFHQ [26], AFHQ [28] and LSUN- Churches [29], as well as various model architectures including EDM-VE [ 3], EDM-VP [2] and EDM-ADM [34]. This emerging linearity implies that the hidden linear structure plays an important role in the generalizability of diffusion model. C Linear Distillation As discussed in Section 3.1, we propose to study the hidden linearity observed in diffusion denosiers with linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)), we aim to approxi- Figure 10: Linearity scores for varying α and β.

Notice that for three dimensional images with size (c, h, w), x ∈ Rd represents their vectorized version, where d = c × w × h.

Addi- tionally, we employ the Adam optimizer [35] for updates. Additional linear distillation results are provided in Figure 14. 17FFHQ CIFAR-10(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 13: Diffusion model exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization. Figure(a) and (d) demonstrate that for both FFHQ and CIFAR-10 datasets, the generalization score increases with the training dataset size, indicating progressive model generaliza- tion. Figure(b), (c), (e), and (f) show that this transition towards generalization is accompanied by increasing denoiser linearity. Specifically, Figure(b) and (e) display linearity scores calculated using cosine similarity (11), while Figure(c) and (f) show scores computed using NMSE (12). Both metrics reveal consistent trends. D Diffusion Models in Low-noise Regime are Approximately Linear Mapping It should be noted that the low score difference between DG and Dθ within the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]) does not imply the diffusion denoisers capture the Gaussian structure, instead, the similarity arises since both of them are converging to the identity mapping as σ(t) decreases. As shown in Figure 15, within this regime, the differences between the noisy input x and their corresponding denoised outputs Dθ(x; σ(t)) quickly approach 0. This indicates that the learned denoisers Dθ progressively converge to the identity function. Additionally, from (6), it is evident that the difference between the Gaussian weights and the identity matrix diminishes as σ(t) decreases, which explains why DG can well approximate Dθ in the low noise variance regime. We hypothesize that Dθ learns the identity function because of the following two reasons: (i) within the low-noise regime, since the added noise is negligible compared to the clean image, the identity function already achieves a small denoising error, thus serving as a shortcut which is exploited by the deep network. (ii) As discussed in Appendix A, diffusion models are typically parameterized as follows: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), where Fθ represents the deep network, and cskip(σ(t)) and cout(σ(t)) are adaptive parameters for the skip connection and output scaling, respectively, which adjust according to the noise variance levels. For canonical works on diffusion models [2–4, 34], as σ(t) approaches zero, cskip and cout converge to 1 and 0 respectively. Consequently, at low variance levels, the function forms of diffusion denoisers are approximatly identity mapping: Dθ(x; σ(t)) ≈ x. This convergence to identity mapping has several implications. First, the weights Wσ(t) of the distilled linear models DL approach the identity matrix at low variances, leading to ambiguous 18Algorithm 1 Linear Distillation Require: (i) the targeted diffusion denoiser Dθ(·; σ(t)), (ii) weights Wσ(t) and biases bσ(t), both initialized to zero, (iii) gradient step size η, (iv) number of training iterations K, (v) training batch size n, (vi) image dataset S. for k = 1 to K do Randomly sample a batch of training images {x1, x2, . . . ,xn} from S.

Figure(a) demonstrates the gradual symmetrization of linear weights during the distillation process. Figure(b) shows that at convergence, the singular values of the linear weights closely match those of the Gaussian weights. Figure(c) and Figure(d) display the leading singular vectors of both linear and Gaussian weights at σ(t) = 4 for FFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets, respectively, revealing a strong correlation. singular vectors. This explains the poor recovery of singular vectors for σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116] shown in Figure 4. Second, the presence of the bias term in (8) makes it challenging for our linear model to learn the identity function, resulting in large errors at σ(t) = 0.002 as shown in Figure 4(a). Finally, from (4), we observe that when Dθ acts as an identity mapping, xi+1 remains unchanged from xi. This implies that sampling steps in low-variance regions minimally affect the generated image content, as confirmed in Figure 2, where image content shows negligible variation during these steps. 19Normalized MSE between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙  Cosine Similarity between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙   (b)(a)  (c) (d) Figure 15: Difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x for various noise variance levels.

Figures(b) and (d) provide zoomed-in views of (a) and (c). The diffusion models were trained on the FFHQ dataset. Notice that the difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x quickly converges to near zero in the low noise variance regime. The trend is consistent for various model architectures. E Theoretical Analysis E.1 Proof of Theorem 1 In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1 (Section 3.3). Our theorem is based on the following two assumptions: Assumption 1. Suppose that the diffusion denoisers are parameterized as single-layer linear net- works, defined as D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is the linear weight and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias. Assumption 2. The data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ Theorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser: DG(x, σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), where Σ = UΛUT represents the SVD of the covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,d} and ˜Λσ(t) = diag[ λk λk+σ(t)2 ]. Furthermore, this optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. To proveTheorem 1, we first show that the Gaussian denoiser is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the linear network constraint. Then we will show that such optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. The Global Optimal Solution. Under the constraint that the diffusion denoiser is restricted to a single-layer linear network with bias: D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), (15) We get the following optimizaiton problem from Equation (3): W⋆, b⋆ = arg min W,b L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2, (16) where we omit the footnote σ(t) in Wσ(t) and bσ(t) for simplicity. Since expectation preserves convexity, the optimization problem Equation (16) is a convex optimization problem. To find the global optimum, we first eliminate b by requiring the partial derivative ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) to be 0. Since ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)((W − I)x + Wϵ + b) (17) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata ((W − I)x + b) (18) = 2 ∗ ((W − I)µ + b), (19) we have b⋆ = (I − W∗)µ. (20) 20Utilizing the expression for b, we get the following equivalent form of the optimization problem: W⋆ = arg min W L(W; σ(t)) := 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x − µ + ϵ) − (x − µ)||2 2. (21) The derivative ∇W L(W; σ(t)) is: ∇W L(W; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ ExEϵ(W(x − µ + ϵ)(x − µ + ϵ)T − (x − µ)(x − µ + ϵ)T ) (22) = 2 ∗ Ex((W − I)(x − µ)(x − µ)T + σ(t)2W) (23) = 2 ∗ W(Σ + σ(t)2I) − 2 ∗ Σ. (24) Suppose Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,n}, by setting ∇W L(W; σ(t)) to 0, we get the optimal solution: W⋆ = UΛUT U(Λ + σ(t)2I)−1UT (25) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT , (26) where ˜Λσ(t)[i, i] = λi λi+σ(t)2 and λi = Λ[i, i]. Substitute W⋆ back to Equation (20), we have: b⋆ = (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (27) Notice that the expression for W⋆ and b⋆ is exactly the Gaussian denoiser. Next, we will show this optimal solution can be achieved with gradient descent. Gradient Descent Recovers the Optimal Solution. Consider minimizing the population loss: L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2. (28) Define ˜W := [W b ], ˜x := \u0014 x 1 \u0015 and ˜ϵ = \u0014 ϵ 0 \u0015 , then we can rewrite Equation (28) as: L( ˜W; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)|| ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ) − x||2 2. (29) We can compute the gradient in terms of ˜W as: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ)(˜x + ˜ϵ)T − x(˜x + ˜ϵ)T ) (30) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x˜xT + ˜x˜ϵT + ˜ϵ˜xT + ˜ϵ˜ϵT ) − x˜xT − x˜ϵT ). (31) Since Eϵ(˜ϵ) = 0 and Eϵ(˜ϵ˜ϵT ) = \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex( ˜W(˜x˜xT + \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 ) − x˜xT ). (32) Since E(˜x˜xT ) = \u0014 E(xxT ) E(x) E(xT ) 1 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ˜W \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 − 2 \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 . (33) With learning rate η, we can write the update rule as: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 ) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 (34) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2ηA) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 , (35) where we define A := I − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 for simplicity. By recursively expanding the expression for ˜W, we have: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(0)At+1 + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 tX i=0 Ai. (36) 21Notice that there exists a η, such that every eigen value of A is smaller than 1 and greater than 0. In this case, At+1 → 0 as t → ∞. Similarly, by the property of matrix geometric series, we havePt i=0 Ai → (I − A)−1. Therefore we have: ˜W → \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ uT 1 \u0015−1 (37) = \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 , (38) where we define B := Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I for simplicity. By the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula, we have: \u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 = \u0014 (B − µµT )−1 −(B − µµT )−1µ −(1 − µT B−1µ)−1µT B−1 (1 − µT B−1µ)−1 \u0015 . (39) Therefore, we have: ˜W → h Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1−µT B−1µ −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1−µT B−1µ i , (40) from which we have W → Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ (41) b → −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1 − µT B−1µ (42) Since Ex[xxT ] = Ex[(x − µ)((x − µ)T ] + µµT , we have: W = Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 + µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ. (43) Applying Sherman-Morrison Formula, we have: (B − µµT )−1 = B−1 + B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ , (44) therefore µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ = µµT B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ − µµT B−1µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ (45) = µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ(µµT B−1 − µµT B−1) (46) = 0 (47) , which implies W → Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 (48) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT . (49) Similarly, we have: b → (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (50) Therefore, gradient descent with a properly chosen learning rate η recovers the Gaussian Denoisers when time goes to infinity. E.2 Two Extreme Cases Our empirical results indicate that the best linear approximation of Dθ is approximately equivalent to DG. According to the orthogonality principle [36], this requires Dθ to satisfy: Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I){(Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − (x − µ))(x + ϵ − µ)T } ≈0. (51) Notice that (51) does not hold for general denoisers. Two extreme cases for this to hold are: 22• Case 1: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ x for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). • Case 2: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ DG(x + ϵ; σ(t)) for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). Case 1 requires Dθ(x+ϵ; σ(t)) to be the oracle denoiser that perfectly recover the ground truth clean image, which never happens in practice except when σ(t) becomes extremely small. Instead, our empirical results suggest diffusion models in the generalization regime bias towards Case 2, where deep networks learn Dθ that approximate (not equal) to DG. This is evidenced in Figure 5(b), where diffusion models trained on larger datasets (35000 and 7000 images) produce denoising outputs similar to DG. Notice that this similarity holds even when the denoisers take pure Gaussian noise as input. The exact mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question and we leave it as future work. F More Discussion on Section 4 While in Section 4 we mainly focus on the discussion of the behavior of diffusion denoisers in the intermediate-noise regime, in this section we study the denoiser dynamics in both low and high-noise regime. We also provide additional experiment results on CIFAR-10 dataset. F.1 Behaviors in Low-noise Regime We visualize the score differences between DG and Dθ in low-noise regime in Figure 16. The left figure demonstrates that when the dataset size becomes smaller than a certain threshold, the score difference at σ = 0 remains persistently non-zero. Moreover, the right figure shows that this difference depends solely on dataset size rather than model capacity. This phenomenon arises from two key factors: (i) Dθ converges to the identity mapping at low noise levels, independent of training dataset size and model capacity, and (ii) DG approximates the identity mapping at low noise levels only when the empirical covariance matrix is full-rank, as can be seen from (6). Since the rank of the covariance matrix is upper-bounded by the training dataset size, DG differs from the identity mapping when the dataset size is smaller than the data dimension. This creates a persistent gap between DG and Dθ, with smaller datasets leading to lower rank and consequently larger score differences. These observations align with our discussion in Appendix D. F.2 Behaviors in High-noise Regime As shown in Figure 7(a), while a decreased model scale pushes Dθ in the intermediate noise region towards DG, their differences enlarges in the high noise variance regime. This phenomenon arises be- cause diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances. A shown in Figure 17, for high σ(t), Dθ converge to DG when trained with sufficient model capacity (Figure 17(b)) and training time (Figure 17(c)). This behavior is consistent irrespective of the training dataset sizes (Figure 17(a)). Convergence in the high-noise variance regime is less crucial in practice, since diffusion steps in Figure 16: Score differences for low-noise variances. The left and right figures are the zoomed-in views of Figure 6(a) and Figure 7(a) respectively. Notice that when the dataset size is smaller than the dimension of the image, the score differences are always non-zero at σ = 0. 23Denoising Outputs  for 𝜎𝑡=60 (PSNR = -29.5 dB)Effect of Model Scale (1094 training images) Effect of Training Epochs (1094 training images) Effect of Dataset Size𝒚=𝒙+𝜎𝑡∗𝝐 𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(4)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(8)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(128) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(187)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(841)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(9173)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64210) (a) (b) (c) Figure 17: Dθ converge to DG with no overfitting for high noise variances.

F.3 Similarity between Diffusion Denoiers and Gaussian Denoisers In Section 4, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent in models with limited capacity and during early training stages, a finding qualitatively validated in Figure 18. Specifically, Figure 18(b) shows that larger models (channel sizes 128 and 64) tend to memorize, 24MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 19: Large dataset size prompts the Gaussian structure.

Figure(a) shows that smaller model scale leads to increased similarity between DG and Dθ in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, smaller scale leads to larger score differences in high-noise regime due to insufficient training from limited model capacity. directly retrieving training data as denoising outputs. In contrast, smaller models (channel sizes 8 and 4) exhibit behavior similar to DG, producing comparable denoising outputs. Similarly, Figure 18(c) reveals that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ outputs progressively align with those of DG. However, extended training beyond this point leads to memorization. F.4 CIFAR-10 Results The effects of model capacity and training duration on the Gaussian inductive bias, as demonstrated in Figures 19 to 21, extend to the CIFAR-10 dataset. These results confirm our findings from Section 4: the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent when model scale and training duration are limited. G Additional Experiment Results While in the main text we mainly demonstrate our findings using EDM-VE diffusion models trained on FFHQ, in this section we show our results are robust and extend to various model architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models, but it is a fundamental property of denoising autoencoders [37]. Lastly, we verify that our 25GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 21: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs.

Figures(a), (b) and (c) correspond to diffusion models trained on FFHQ, with EDM-VE, EDM-ADM and EDM-VP network architectures specified in [4] respectively. conclusions remain consistent when using alternative metrics such as NMSE instead of the RMSE used in the main text. G.1 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various Network Architectures We first demonstrate that diffusion models capture the Gaussian structure of the training dataset, irrespective of the deep network architectures used. As shown in Figure 22 (a), (b), and (c), although the actual diffusion models, Dθ, are parameterized with different architectures, for all noise variances except σ(t) ∈ {0.002, 80.0}, their corresponding linear models, DL, consistently converge towards the common Gaussian models, DG, determined by the training dataset. Qualitatively, as depicted in Figure 23, despite variations in network architectures, diffusion models generate nearly identical images, matching those generated from the Gaussian models. G.2 Gaussian Inductive Bias as a General Property of DAEs In previous sections, we explored the properties of diffusion models by interpreting them as collections of deep denoisers, which are equivalent to the denoising autoencoders (DAEs) [37] trained on various noise variances by minimizing the denoising score matching objective(3). Although diffusion models and DAEs are equivalent in the sense that both of them are trying to learn the score function of the 26Figure 23: Images sampled from various model. The figure shows the sampled images from diffusion models with different network architectures and those from their corresponding Gaussian models. noise-mollified data distribution [38], the training objective of diffusion models is more complex [4]: min θ Ex,ϵ,σ[λ(σ)cout(σ)2||Fθ(x + ϵ, σ) − 1 cout(σ)(x − cskip(σ)(x + ϵ)) | {z } linear combination of x and ϵ ||2 2], (52) where x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I) and σ ∼ ptrain. Notice that the training objective of diffusion models has a few distinct characteristics: • Diffusion models use a single deep network Fθ to perform denoising score matching across all noise variances while DAEs are typically trained separately for each noise level. • Diffusion models are not trained uniformly across all noise variances. Instead, during training the probability of sampling a given noise level σ is controlled by a predefined distribution ptrain and the loss is weighted by λ(σ). • Diffusion models often utilize special parameterizations (13). Therefore, the deep network Fθ is trained to predict a linear combination of the clean image x and the noise ϵ, whereas DAEs typically predict the clean image directly. Given these differences, we investigate whether the Gaussian inductive bias is unique to diffusion models or a general characteristic of DAEs. To this end, we train separate DAEs (deep denoisers) using the vanilla denoising score matching objective (3) on each of the 10 discrete noise variances specified by the EDM schedule [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002], and compare the score differences between them and the corresponding Gaussian denoisers DG. We use no special parameterization so that Dθ = Fθ; that is, the deep network directly predicts the clean image. Furthermore, the DAEs for each noise variance are trained till convergence, ensuring all noise levels are trained sufficiently. We consider the following architectural choices: • DAE-NCSN: In this setting, the network Fθ uses the NCSN architecture [3], the same as that used in the EDM-VE diffusion model. • DAE-Skip: In this setting, Fθ is a U-Net [ 39] consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization [40], leaky ReLU activation [41] and convolutional skip connections. We refer to this network as ”Skip-Net”. Compared to NCSN, which adapts the state of the art architecture designs, Skip-Net is deliberately constructed to be as simple as possible to test how architectural complexity affects the Gaussian inductive bias. • DAE-DiT: In this setting, Fθ is a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) introduced in [42]. Vision Transformers are known to lack inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance that are inherent to convolutional models [43]. Here we are interested in if this affects the Gaussian inductive bias. 27Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) (a) (b) Figure 24: Comparison between DAEs and diffusion models. Figure(a) compares the score field approximation error between Gaussian models and both (i) diffusion models (EDM vs. Gaussian) and (ii) DAEs with varying architectures. Figure(b) illustrates the generation trajectories of different models initialized from the same noise input. • DAE-Linear: In this setting we set Fθ to be a linear model with a bias term as in (8). According to Theorem 1, these models should converge to Gaussian denoisers. The quantitative results are shown in Figure 24(a). First, the DAE-linear models well approximateDG across all 10 discrete steps (RMSE smaller than 0.04), consistent with Theorem 1. Second, despite the differences between diffusion models (EDM) and DAEs, they achieve similar score approximation errors relative to DG for most noise variances, meaning that they can be similarly approximated by DG. However, diffusion models exhibit significantly larger deviations fromDG at higher noise variances (σ ∈ {42.415, 80.0}) since they utilize a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution ptrain that emphasizes training on intermediate noise levels, leading to under-training at high noise variances. Lastly, the DAEs with different architectures achieve comparable score approximation errors, and both DAEs and diffusion models generate images matching those from the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 24(b). These findings demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models or specific architectures but is a fundamental property of DAEs. G.3 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various datasets As illustrated in Figure 25, for diffusion models trained on the CIFAR-10, AFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets that are in the generalization regime, their generated samples match those produced by the corresponding Gaussian models. Additionally, their linear approximations, DL, obtained through linear distillation, align closely with the Gaussian models, DG, resulting in nearly identical generated images. These findings confirm that the Gaussian structure is prevalent across various datasets. G.4 Strong Generalization on CIFAR-10 Figure 26 demonstrates the strong generalization effect on CIFAR-10. Similar to the observations in Section 5, reducing model capacity or early stopping the training process prompts the Gaussian inductive bias, leading to generalization. G.5 Measuring Score Approximation Error with NMSE While in Section 3.1 we define the score field approximation error between denoisers D1 and D2 with RMSE ( (10)), this error can also be quantified using NMSE: Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) ||D1(x + ϵ) − D2(x + ϵ)||2 ||D1(x + ϵ)||2 . (53) As shown in Figure 27, while the trend in intermediate-noise and low-noise regimes remains unchanged, NMSE amplifies differences in the high-noise variance regime compared to RMSE. This amplified score difference between DG and Dθ does not contradict our main finding that diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers 28Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated Samples Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated SamplesLSUN-Churches AFHQ(a) (b) (c) (d) Final Generated SamplesCIFAR- 10Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) image 1image 2image 3image 4image 5 (e) (f) Figure 25: Final generated images and sampling trajectories for various models.

Figures(b), (d) and (f) demonstrate the corresponding sampling trajectories. approximately equivalent to DG in the high-noise variance regime. As discussed in Section 3.2 and appendices F.2 and G.2, this large score difference stems from inadequate training in this regime. Figure 27 (Gaussian vs. DAE) demonstrates that when DAEs are sufficiently trained at specific noise variances, they still converge to DG. Importantly, the insufficient training in the high-noise variance regime minimally affects final generation quality. Figure 25(f) shows that while the diffusion model (EDM) produces noisy trajectories at early timesteps ( σ ∈ {80.0, 42.415}), these artifacts quickly disappear in later stages, indicating that the Gaussian inductive bias is most influential in the intermediate-noise variance regime. Notably, even when Dθ are inadequately trained in the high-noise variance regime, they remain approximable by linear functions, though these functions no longer match DG. 29Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 25000, model scale 64 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 25000)Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 782) Non-overlapping datasets with size 782, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 4 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (782) Figure 26: Strong generalization on CIFAR-10 dataset.

H Discussion on Geometry-Adaptive Harmonic Bases H.1 GAHB only Partially Explain the Strong Generalization Recent work [20] observes that diffusion models trained on sufficiently large non-overlapping datasets (of the same class) generate nearly identical images. They explain this ”strong generalization” phenomenon by analyzing bias-free deep diffusion denoisers with piecewise linear input-output 30mappings: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))x (54) = X k λk(xt)uk(xt)vT k (xt)xt, (55) where λk(xt), uk(xt), and vk(xt) represent the input-dependent singular values, left and right singular vectors of the network Jacobian ∇D(xt; σ(t)). Under this framework, strong generalization occurs when two denoisers D1 and D2 have similar Jacobians: ∇D1(xt; σ(t)) ≈ ∇D2(xt; σ(t)). The authors conjecture this similarity arises from networks’ inductive bias towards learning certain optimal ∇D(xt; σ(t)) that has sparse singular values and the singular vectors of which are the geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHB)—near-optimal denoising bases that adapt to input xt. While [20] provides valuable insights, their bias-free assumption does not reflect real-world diffusion models, which inherently contain bias terms. For feed forward ReLU networks, the denoisers are piecewise affine: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))xt + bxt, (56) where bxt is the network bias that depends on both network parameterization and the noisy input xt [44]. Here, similar Jacobians alone cannot explain strong generalization, as networks may differ significantly in bxt. For more complex network architectures where even piecewise affinity fails, we consider the local linear expansion of D(xt; σ(t)): D(xt + ∆x; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))∆xt + D(xt; σ(t)), (57) which approximately holds for small perturbation ∆x. Thus, although ∇D(xt; σ(t)) characterizes D(xt; σ(t))’s local behavior around xt, it does not provide sufficient information on the global properties. Our work instead examines global behavior, demonstrating that D(xt; σ(t)) is close to DG(xt; σ(t))—the optimal linear denoiser under the Gaussian data assumption. This implies that strong generalization partially stems from networks learning similar Gaussian structures across non-overlapping datasets of the same class. Since our linear model captures global properties but not local characteristics, it complements the local analysis in [20]. H.2 GAHB Emerge only in Intermediate-Noise Regime For completeness, we study the evolution of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across various noise levels σ(t). The results are presented in Figures 28 and 29, which reveal three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [10,80]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors6 of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) well align with those of the Gaussian weights (the leading principal components of the training dataset), consistent with our finding that diffusion denoisers approximate linear Gaussian denoisers in this regime. Notice that DAEs trained sufficiently on separate noise levels (Figure 29) show stronger alignment compared to vanilla diffusion models (Figure 28), which suffer from insufficient training at high noise levels. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,10]: In this regime, GAHB emerge as singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) diverge from the principal components, becoming increasingly adaptive to the geometry of input image. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) show no clear patterns, consistent with our observation that diffusion denoisers approach the identical mapping, which has unconstrained singular vectors. Notice that the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) are the input directions that lead to the maximum variation in denoised outputs, thus revealing meaningful information on the local properties of D(xt; σ(t)) at xt. As demonstrated in Figure 30, perturbing input xt along these vectors at difference noise regimes leads to distinct effects on the final generated images: (i) in the high-noise regime where the leading singular vectors align with the principal components of the training dataset, 6We only care about leading singular vectors since the Jacobians in this regime are highly low-rank. The less well aligned singular vectors have singular values near 0. 31Generation Trajectories                     &(\"#;$(%)) (a) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  )%)(\"#) (b) )( )) )* (c) *+(\",)across Various $(%)   (d) (e) (f) *&(\",)across Various $(%)   *-(\",)across Various $(%)   Figure 28: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels. Figure(a) shows the generation trajectory. Figure(b) shows the correlation matrix between Jacobian singular vectors U(xt) and training dataset principal components U. Notice that the leading singular vectors of U(xt) and U well align in early timesteps but diverge in later timesteps. Figure(c) shows the first three principal components of the training dataset while figures(d-f) show the evolution of Jacobian’s first three singular vectors across noise levels. These singular vectors initially match the principal components but progressively adapt to input image geometry, before losing distinct patterns at very low noise levels. While we present only left singular vectors, right singular vectors exhibit nearly identical behavior and yield equivalent results. perturbing xt along these directions leads to canonical changes such as image class, (ii) in the intermediate-noise regime where the GAHB emerge, perturbing xt along the leading singular vectors modify image details such as colors while preserving overall image structure and(iii) in the low-noise regime where the leading singular vectors have no significant pattern, perturbing xt along these directions yield no meaningful semantic changes. These results collectively demonstrate that the singular vectors of the network Jacobian∇D(xt; σ(t)) have distinct properties at different noise regimes, with GAHB emerging specifically in the intermedi- ate regime. This characterization has significant implications for uncertainty quantification [45] and image editing [46]. 32(a)))(\"+)across Various $(%)   (b))*(\"+)across Various $(%)   (c))((\"+)across Various $(%)   (d) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  (%((\"+) Figure 29: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels for DAEs.

At very low noise variances, perturbation has no significant effect (Figure (c)). Similar effects are observed in concurrent work [46].

Consequently, fine-tuning well pre-trained, large-scale models for specific tasks has become increasingly crucial in practice [53, 59, 55]. During the past years, the deep learning community has concentrated on how to transfer knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models with minimal computational and memory demands, a process known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) [19, 58, 53, 7, 20, 31]. The central insight of these approaches is to update as few parameters as possible while avoiding performance decline. However, the intrinsic transfer properties of diffusion models have remained largely unexplored, with scant attention paid to effectively fine-tuning from a pre-trained diffusion model. Previous studies on neural network transferability, such as those by [ 32, 56], have demonstrated that lower-level features are generally more transferable than higher-level features. In the context of diffusion models, which transform noise into data through a reverse process, it is logical to assume that the initial stages, which are responsible for shaping high-level objects, differ in transferability ∗Equal contribution Preprint. arXiv:2406.00773v2  [cs.LG]  6 Jun 2024from later stages that refine details. This differential transferability across the denoising stages presents an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of fine-tuning. In this work, we investigate the transferability within the reverse process of diffusion models. Firstly, we propose that a pre-trained model can act as a universal denoiser for lightly corrupted data, capable of recognizing and refining subtle distortions (see Figure 1). This ability leads to improved generation quality when we directly replace the fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained one under low distortion. The suboptimality observed with fine-tuned models suggests potential overfitting, mode collapse, or undesirable forgetting. Then we extend the experiments by gradually increasing the denoising steps replaced, to cover higher-level noised data, observing the boundaries of zero-shot generalization capability. This indicates that the fine-tuning objective should prioritize high-level shaping, associated with domain-specific characteristics. We term this gradual loss of adaptability the chain of forgetting, which tends to retain low-level denoising skills while forgetting high-level, domain-specific characteristics during the transfer of the pre-trained model. We further provide novel theoretical insights to reveal the principles behind the chain of forgetting. Since the chain of forgetting suggests different denoising stages lead to different forgetting preferences, it is reasonable to develop a transfer strategy that balances the degrees of forgetting and retention. Technically, based on the above motivation, we propose Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple but general fine-tuning approach for diffusion models. Diff-Tuning extends the conventional fine- tuning objectives by integrating two specific aims: 1) knowledge retention, which retains general denoising knowledge; 2) knowledge reconsolidation, which tailors high-level shaping characteristics to specific downstream domains. Diff-Tuning leverages the chain of forgetting to balance these two complementary objectives throughout the reverse process. Experimentally, Diff-Tuning achieves significant performance improvements over standard fine- tuning in two mainstream fine-tuning scenarios: conditional generation and controllable generation with ControlNet [59]. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • Motivated by the transferable features of deep neural networks, we explore the transferability of diffusion models through the reverse process and observe a chain of forgetting tendency. We provide a novel theoretical perspective to elucidate the underlying principles of this phenomenon for diffusion models. • We introduce Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple yet effective transfer learning method that integrates two key objectives: knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation. Diff- Tuning harmonizes these two complementary goals by leveraging the chain of forgetting. • As a general transfer approach, Diff-Tuning achieves significant improvements over its stan- dard fine-tuning counterparts in conditional generation across eight datasets and controllable generation using ControlNet under five distinct conditions. Notably, Diff-Tuning enhances the transferability of the current PEFT approaches, demonstrating the generality. 2 Related Work 2.1 Diffusion Models Diffusion models [ 16] and their variants [ 46, 47, 22] represent the state-of-the-art in generative modeling [12, 3], capable of progressively generating samples from random noise through a chain of denoising processes. Researchers have developed large-scale foundation diffusion models across a broad range of domains, including image synthesis [16], video generation [18], and cross-modal generation [42, 41]. Typically, training diffusion models involves learning a parametrized functionf to distinguish the noise signal from a disturbed sample, as formalized below: L(θ) =Et,x0,ϵ h\r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtx0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i (1) where x0 ∼ Xrepresents real samples, ϵ ∼ N(0, I) denotes the noise signal, and xt = √αtx0 +√1 − αtϵ is the disturbed sample at timestep t. Sampling from diffusion models following a Markov chain by iteratively denoising from xT ∼ N(0, I) to x0. Previous research on diffusion models primarily focuses on noise schedules [ 35, 22], training objectives [43, 22], efficient sampling [45], and model architectures [38]. In contrast to these existing 2Relative Gain (FID) Improve by zero-shot denoising from pre-trained knowledge Performance drops  due to domain-specific  characteristics Replaced Steps (𝑡) Disturbed  Fine-tuned  Diff-Tuning Pre-trained  Fine-tuned  Diff-Tuning Pre-trained Disturbed Figure 1: Case study of directly replacing the denoiser with the original pre-trained model on lightly disturbed data (left). The changes in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) as the denoising steps are incrementally replaced by the original pre-trained model (right). works, our method investigates the transferability of diffusion models across different denoising stages and enhances the transfer efficacy in a novel and intrinsic way. 2.2 Transfer Learning Transfer learning [37] is an important machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the perfor- mance of target tasks by leveraging knowledge from source domains. Transferring from pre-trained models, commonly known as fine-tuning, has been widely proved effective in practice, especially for the advanced large-scale models [5, 1, 12]. However, directly fine-tuning a pre-trained model can cause overfitting, mode collapse, and catastrophic forgetting [23]. Extensive prior work has focused on overcoming these challenges to ultimately enhance the utilization of knowledge from pre-trained models [2, 8, 60]. However, effective transfer of diffusion models has received scant attention. Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) With significant advancements in the development of large-scale models [ 10, 5, 1, 12], research in transfer learning has increasingly concentrated on PEFT methods that minimize the number of learnable parameters. The primary goal of PEFT is to reduce time and memory costs associated with adapting large-scale pre-trained models. Techniques such as incorporating extra adapters [19, 59, 34] and learning partial or re-parameterized parameters [58, 20, 21, 14] are employed for their effectiveness in reducing computational demands. Nevertheless, the reliance on deep model architectures and the necessity of carefully selecting optimal placements present substantial challenges. Intuitively, PEFT approaches could potentially mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving most parameters unchanged; for a detailed discussion, refer to Section 4.3. Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting Catastrophic forgetting is a long-standing challenge in the context of continual learning, lifelong learning, and transfer learning, referring to the tendency of neural networks to forget previously acquired knowledge when fine-tuning on new tasks. Recent ex- ploration in parameter regularization approaches [23, 27, 26, 8] have gained prominence. Approaches such as [ 57, 28, 51] propose the data-based regularization, which involves distilling pre-trained knowledge into a knowledge bank. However, efforts to mitigate forgetting within the framework of diffusion models remain notably scarce. 3 Method 3.1 Chain of Forgetting Compared with one-way models, diffusion models specify in a manner of multi-step denoising and step-independent training objectives. Inspired by prior studies on the transferability of deep neural features [56, 32], we first explore how the transferability of diffusion models varies along the denoising steps. Pre-trained Model Serves as a Zero-Shot Denoiser Modern large-scale models are pre-trained with a large training corpus, emerging powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities. We begin by analyzing whether the pre-trained diffusion models hold similar zero-shot denoising capabilities. In particular, we utilize a popular pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model [38] as our testbed. We fine-tune the DiT model on a downstream dataset. When the reverse process comes to the the last 10% steps, we switch and continue the remaining denoising steps with the fine-tuned model, the original 3pre-trained model, and our Diff-Tuning model respectively. We visualize a case study in Figure 1 (left) with corresponding replacement setups. Surprisingly, the results reveal that replacement by the pre-trained model achieves competitive quality, even slightly better than the fine-tuned one, indicating that the pre-trained diffusion model indeed holds the zero-shot denoising skills. On the other side, some undesirable overfitting and forgetting occur when fine-tuning diffusion models. Forgetting Trend Next, we delve deeper into investigating the boundary of generalization capabili- ties for the pre-trained model. Figure 1 (right) illustrates the performance trend when we gradually increase the percentage of denoising steps replaced from 0 to 100%. Initially, this naive replacement yields better generation when applied towards the end of the reverse process. However, as more steps are replaced, performance begins to decline due to domain mismatch. This trend suggests the fine-tuned model may overfit the downstream task and forget some of the fundamental denoising knowledge initially possessed by the pre-trained model whent is small. Conversely, ast increases, the objects desirable in the new domain are distorted by the pre-trained model, resulting in a performance drop. Based on these observations, we conceptually separate the reverse process into two stages: (1) domain-specific shaping, and (2) general noise refining. We claim that the general noise refining stage is more transferable and can be reused across various domains. In contrast, the domain-specific shaping stage requires the fine-tuned model to forget the characteristics of the original domain and relearn from the new domains. Theoretic Insights Beyond empirical observations, we provide a novel theoretical perspective of the transfer preference for the pre-trained diffusion model. Following the objectives of diffusion models, a denoiser F (an x0-reparameterization [22] of f in Eq. (1)) is to approximate the posterior expectation of real data over distribution D. This is formalized by: F(xt) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) [x0] = R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 · pD(x0)dx0 R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · pD(x0)dx0 , (2) where pD(x0) represents the distribution of real data from D, and N denotes the Gaussian distribu- tions determined by the forward process. Notably, a larger variance of Gaussian distribution indicates a more uniform distribution. Through a detailed investigation of these Gaussian distributions under varying timesteps t, we derive the following theorem. All proofs and derivations are provided in Appendix A. Theorem 1 (Chain of Forgetting) Suppose a diffusion model with lim t→0 αt = 1 and lim t→T αt = 0 over finite samples, then the ideal denoiser F satisfies 1. lim t→0 F(xt) = argmin p(x0)>0 {∥x0 − xt∥}, i.e., the closest sample in dataset. 2. lim t→T F(xt) =Ex0∼pD(x0)[x0], i.e., the mean of data distribution. Theorem 1 elucidates the mechanism behind the chain of forgetting. On one hand, when t → 0, a model optimized on a training dataset D can perform zero-shot denoising within the vicinity of the support set supp(D). As the training dataset scale expands, so does the coverage of supp(D), enabling diffusion models to act as general zero-shot denoisers for data associated with small t. On the other hand, as t → T, the model’s generalization is significantly influenced by the distribution distance dist(ED[x0], EDnew [xnew 0 ]), where Dnew denotes the dataset of the new domain. This theorem highlights the necessity for further adaptation in the new domain. 3.2 Diff-Tuning Based on the above observations and theoretical insights, we introduce Diff-Tuning, which incor- porates two complementary strategies to leverage the chain of forgetting in the reverse process: 1) knowledge retention, and 2) knowledge reconsolidation. Diff-Tuning aims to retain general denoising skills from the pre-trained model while discarding its redundant, domain-specific shaping knowl- edge. This enables the model to adapt more effectively to the specific characteristics of downstream tasks. Diff-Tuning harmonizes the retention and reconsolidation via the chain of forgetting tendency. Without loss of generality, we present Diff-Tuning under the standard DDPM objective, omitting conditions in the formulations. The general conditional generation setup will be discussed later. 4Knowledge Retention Knowledge Reconsolidation Build Knowledge(a) Diff-Tuning(b) 𝐱! 𝐱\" 𝐱\"#$ 𝐱!⋯ ⋯ Retain ⋯ ⋯ Tune Reverse ProcessNoise Data Chain of Forgetting General Noise RefiningDomain-Specific Shaping Figure 2: The conceptual illustration of the chain of forgetting (Left). The increasing forgetting tendency as t grows. (a) Build a knowledge bank for the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. (b) Diff-Tuning leverages knowledge retention and reconsolidation, via the chain of forgetting. Knowledge Retention As discussed earlier, retaining pre-trained knowledge during the latter general noising refining proves beneficial. However, the classic parameter-regularization-based approaches [23, 8, 26] mitigate forgetting uniformly across the reverse process, primarily due to the parameter-sharing design inherent in diffusion models. To address this, Diff-Tuning constructs an augmented dataset bXs = {bxs, ···} , pre-sampled from the pre-trained model. This dataset acts as a repository of the retained knowledge of the pre-trained model. We define the auxiliary training objective, Lretention, as follows: Lretention(θ) =Et,ϵ,bxs 0∼ bXs h ξ(t) \r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtbxs 0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i , (3) where ξ(t) is the retention coefficient. In accordance with the principles of the chain of forgetting, ξ(t) decreases monotonically with increasing t, promoting the retention of knowledge associated with small t values and the discarding of knowledge related to large t values. Knowledge Retention shares a similar formulation with the pre-training objective but without the reliance on the original pre-training dataset. Knowledge Reconsolidation In contrast to knowledge retention, knowledge reconsolidation fo- cuses on adapting pre-trained knowledge to new domains. The intuition behind knowledge reconsoli- dation is to diminish the conflict between forgetting and adaptation by emphasizing the tuning of knowledge associated with large t. This adaptation is formalized as follows: Ladaptaion(θ) =Et,ϵ,x0∼X h ψ(t) \r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtx0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i , (4) where ψ(t) is the reconsolidation coefficient, a monotonic increasing function within the range [0, 1], reflecting increased emphasis on domain-specific adaptation as t increases. A frustratingly simple approach Overall, we reach Diff-Tuning, a general fine-tuning approach for effective transferring pre-trained diffusion models to downstream generations, the overall objective is as follows: min θ Lretention(θ) +Ladaptation(θ), (5) where Lretention(θ) and Ladaptation(θ) are described before, θ represents the set of tunable parameters. Notably, Diff-Tuning is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with existing PEFT methods. Further details are discussed in Section 4.3. Choices of ξ(t) and ψ(t) For clarity and simplicity, we define ξ(t) = 1− ψ(t), ensuring equal weighting for each t, following the original DDPM configuration. This complementary design excludes the influences of recent studies on the t-reweighting techniques [22, 12, 9]. From the above 5discussion, we can choose any monotonic increase function whose range falls in the [0, 1]. In this work, we scale the variable t to the interval [0, 1], and apply a simple power function groupψ(t) =tτ for practical implementation. In our experiments, we report the main results with τ = 1, and the variations of the choice are explored in Section 4.4. Conditional Generation Classifier-free guidance (CFG) [17] forms the basis for large-scale con- ditional diffusion models. To facilitate sampling with CFG, advanced diffusion models such as DiT [ 38] and Stable Diffusion [ 12] are primarily trained conditionally. CFG is formulated as ϵ = (1 +w)ϵc − wϵu, where w, ϵc, ϵu are the CFG weight, conditional output, and unconditional output. As a general approach, Diff-Tuning inherits the conditional training and sampling setup to support a wide range of transfer tasks. Due to the mismatch between the pre-training domain and downstream tasks in the conditional space, we apply knowledge retention Lretention on the un- conditional branch and knowledge reconsolidation Ladaptation on both unconditional and conditional branches. 4 Experiments To fully verify the effectiveness of Diff-Tuning, we extensively conduct experiments across two main- stream fine-tuning scenarios: 1) Class-conditional generation, which involves eight well-established fine-grained downstream datasets, and 2) Controllable generation using the recently popular Control- Net [59], which includes five distinct control conditions. 4.1 Transfer to Class-conditional Generation Setups Class-conditioned generation is a fundamental application of diffusion models. To fully evaluate transfer efficiency, we adhere to the benchmarks with a resolution of256 × 256 as used in DiffFit [53], including datasets such as Food101 [4], SUN397 [52], DF20-Mini [39], Caltech101 [13], CUB-200-2011 [49], ArtBench-10 [29], Oxford Flowers [ 36], and Stanford Cars [ 25]. Our base model, the DiT-XL-2-256x256 [38], is pre-trained on ImageNet at 256 × 256 resolution, achieving a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [15] of 2.27 2. The FID is calculated by measuring the distance between the generated images and a test set, serving as a widely used metric for evaluating generative image models’ quality. We adhere to the default generation protocol as specified in [53], generating 10K instances with 50 DDIM [45] sampling steps (FID-10K). βcfg weight is set to 1.5 for evaluation. For the implemented DiffFit baseline, we follow the optimal settings in [53], which involve enlarging the learning rate ×10 and carefully placing the scale factor to 1 to 14 blocks. For each result, we fine-tune 24K iterations with a batch size of 32 for standard fine-tuning and Diff-Tuning, and a batch size of 64 for DiffFit, on one NVIDIA A100 40G GPU. For each benchmark, we recorded the Relative Promotio of FID between Diff-Tuning and Full Fine-tuning (Diff-Tuning−Full Fine-tuning Full Fine-tuning ) to highlight the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details can be found in Appendix B. Table 1: Comparisons on 8 downstream tasks with pre-trained DiT-XL-2-256x256.

Compared with other baselines, our Diff-Tuning consistently exhibits the lowest FID across all benchmarks, outperforming the standard fine-tuning by a significant margin (relative 26.0% overpass), In contrast, some PEFT techniques do not yield improved results compared to standard fine-tuning. A detailed comparison with DiffFit is discussed in subsequent sections. 4.2 Transfer to Controllable Generation Suddenconvergencepickedthreshold Figure 3: An example of evaluating dissimilarities between conditions (the Normal condition) to infer the occurrence of sudden convergence. Setups Controlling diffusion models enables personaliza- tion, customization, or task-specific image generation. In this section, we evaluate Diff-Tuning on the popular Con- trolNet [59], a state-of-the-art controlling technique for dif- fusion models, which can be viewed as fine-tuning the sta- ble diffusion model with conditional adapters at a high level. We test Diff-Tuning under various image-based conditions provided by ControlNet 3, including Sketch [ 50], Edge [ 6], Normal Map [ 48], Depth Map [ 40], and Segmentation on the COCO [30] and ADE20k [61] datasets at a resolution of 512×512. We fine-tune ControlNet for 15k iterations for each condition except 5k for Sketch and 20k for Segmentation on ADE20k, using a batch size of 4 on one NVIDIA A100 40G GPU. For more specific training and inference parameters, refer to Appendix B. Evaluation through Sudden Convergence Steps Due to the absence of a robust quantitative metric for evaluating fine-tuning approaches with ControlNet, we propose a novel metric based on the sudden convergence steps. In the sudden convergence phenomenon, as reported in [59], ControlNet tends not to learn control conditions gradually but instead abruptly gains the capability to synthesize images according to these conditions after reaching a sudden convergence point. This phenomenon is observable in the showcases presented in Figure 4 throughout the tuning process. We propose measuring the (dis-)similarity between the original controlling conditions and the post-annotated conditions of the corresponding controlled generated samples. As depicted in Figure 3, a distinct “leap” occurs along the training process, providing a clear threshold to determine whether sudden convergence has occurred. We manually select this threshold, combined with human assessment, to identify the occurrence of sudden convergence. The detailed setup of this metric is discussed in Appendix C. Results As demonstrated in Table 2, Diff-Tuning consistently requires significantly fewer steps to reach sudden convergence across all controlling conditions compared to standard fine-tuning of ControlNet, indicating a consistent enhancement in the transfer efficiency. In Figure 4, we display showcases from the training process both with and without Diff-Tuning. It is observed that Diff- Tuning achieves sudden convergence significantly faster, enabling the generation of well-controlled samples more quickly. By comparing the images from the final converged model at the same step, it is evident that our proposed Diff-Tuning achieves superior image generation quality.

This strategy ensures that knowledge from previously learned tasks is not overwritten. In transfer learning, however, the objective shifts to adapting a pre-trained model for new, downstream tasks. This adaptation often presents unique challenges. Prior studies indicate that PEFT methods struggle to match the performance of full model fine-tuning unless modifications are carefully implemented. Such modifications include significantly increasing learning rates, sometimes by more than tenfold, and strategically placing tunable parameters within suitable blocks [20, 7, 53]. Consider the state-of-the-art method, DiffFit, which updates only the bias terms in networks, merely 0.12% of the parameters in DiT equating to approximately 0.83 million parameters. While this might seem efficient, such a small proportion of tunable parameters is enough to risk overfitting downstream tasks. Increasing the learning rate to compensate for the limited number of trainable parameters can inadvertently distort the underlying pre-trained knowledge, raising the risk of training instability and potentially causing a sudden and complete degradation of the pre-trained knowledge, as observed in studies like [53]. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [23] is a classic parameter-regularized approach to preserve knowledge in a neural network. We calculate the L2-EWC values, which are defined as EWC = ∥θ − θ0∥2, for the tunable parameters in the evaluated approaches [27]. The EWC value quantifies how far the fine-tuned model deviates from the pre-trained model, indicating the degree of knowledge forgetting from the perspective of parameter space. Figure 5(b) reveals that DiffFit leads to EWC values that are 2.42 times larger with only 0.12% tunable parameters, indicating heavy distortion of the pre-trained knowledge. Figure 5(c) illustrates the averaged EWC over tunable parameters, showing that each tunable bias term contributes significantly more to the EWC. In contrast, Diff-Tuning achieves lower EWC values. Diff-Tuning does not explicitly focus on avoiding forgetting in the parameter space but rather harmonizes the chain of forgetting in the parameter-sharing diffusion model and only retains knowledge associated with small t rather than the entire reverse process. 8Diff-Tuning can be directly applied to current PEFT approaches, and the comparison results in Figure 5 demonstrate that Diff-Tuning can enhance the transfer capability of DiffFit and significantly improve converged performance. 4.4 Analysis and Ablation Fine-tuning Convergence Analysis To analyze converging speed, we present a concrete study on the convergence of the FID scores for standard fine-tuning, DiffFit, Diff-Tuning, and Diff-Tuning∗ (DiffFit equipped with Diff-Tuning) every 1,500 iterations in the SUN 397 dataset, as shown in Figure 6(a). Compared to standard fine-tuning and DiffFit, Diff-Tuning effectively leverages the chain of forgetting, achieving a balance between forgetting and retaining. This leads to faster convergence and superior results. Furthermore, the result of Diff-Tuning∗ indicates that PEFT methods such like DiffFit still struggle with forgetting and overfitting. These methods can benefit from Diff-Tuning. Tradeoff the Forgetting and Retraining with the Chain of Forgetting For simplicity and ease of implementation, Diff-Tuning adopts a power function, ψ(t) =t, as the default reconsolidation coeffi- cient. To explore sensitivity to hyperparameters, we conduct experiments using various coefficient functions ψ(t) =tτ with τ values from the set {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5}, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based function ψ(t) = 1/(1 +SNR(t)) [9]. Results on the Stanford Car dataset, shown in Figure 6(c), a carefully tuned coefficient can yield slightly better results. To keep the simplicity, we keep the default setting τ = 1. Notably, when τ = 0, Diff-Tuning reduces to the standard fine-tuning. Analysis on Knowledge Retention In Diff-Tuning, knowledge is retained using pre-sampled data from pre-trained diffusion models before fine-tuning. We evaluate the impact of varying sample sizes (5K, 50K, 100K, 200K, and the entire source dataset) on the performance of the DiT model on the Stanford Car dataset, as illustrated in Figure 6(d). Notably, using the entire source dataset, which comprises 1.2M ImageNet images, results in suboptimal outcomes. This observation underscores that pre-sampled data serve as a more precise distillation of pre-trained knowledge, aligning with our goal of retraining knowledge rather than merely introducing extra training data. Ablation Study we explore the efficacy of each module within Diff-Tuning, specifically focusing on knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation. We assess Diff-Tuning against its variants where: (1) Only reconsolidation is applied, setting ξ(t) ≡ 0 and ψ(t) =t; and (2) Only retention is employed, setting ξ(t) = 1− t and ψ(t) ≡ 1. The results, illustrated in Figure 6(b) demonstrate that both knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation effectively leverage the chain of forgetting to enhance fine-tuning performance. The FID scores reported on the DF20M dataset clearly show that combining these strategies leads to more efficient learning adaptations. 14.74 13.57 13.65 12.57 6.04 5.62 5.36 5.58 5.34 5.37 5.96 5.56 5.54 5.52 5.50 5.39 (a) Convergence analysis on SUN 397 (b) Ablation study on DF20M (c) The sensitivity of 𝜏\tin 𝜓 𝑡 on Car (d) Analysis on the #samples in memory on Car 𝜓 𝑡 = 1 1 + SNR(𝑡) Standard fine-tuning Recon.

We present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple but general transfer learning approach designed for pre-trained diffusion models, leveraging the identified trend of the chain of forgetting. Diff-Tuning effectively enhances transfer performance by integrating knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation techniques. Experimentally, Diff-Tuning shows great generality and performance in advanced diffusion models, including conditional generation and controllable synthesis. Additionally, Diff-Tuning is compatible with existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. 9References [1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

In CVPR, 2017. 12A Proofs of Theoretical Explanation in Section 3.1 In this section we provide the formal definations and proofs for theoretical explanation of chain of forgetting. From the setup of diffusion model training and previous works [ 22], we suppose the dataset consists of finite bounded samples D = {x(1) 0 , x(2) 0 , ...,x(n) 0 }, and f is the denoiser to minimize L(θ) as in Eq. (1) under ϵ-parameterization. For convenience, we first convert the denoiser into x0-parameterization by F(xt) =xt−√1−αtf(xt)√αt and the objective becomes L = Et,x0,xt h ∥x0 − F(xt)∥2 i . (6) Ideal Denoiser in Eq. (6). An ideal denoiser F should minimize the value F(xt) for all t, xt almost surely, implying an objective for F(xt): Lt,xt (F(xt)) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) h ∥x0 − F(xt)∥2 i . (7) By taking a derivative, it holds that 0 =∇F(xt)Lt,xt (F(xt)) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) [−2 (x0 − F(xt))] , (8) and finally, F(xt) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt)[x0] (9) = Z x0 x0 · p(x0|xt)dx0 (10) = R x0 x0 · pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 pD(xt) (11) = R x0 x0 · pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 R x0 pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 (12) = R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 · pD(x0)dx0 R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · pD(x0)dx0 (13) = P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 (14) Remark. This ideal denoiser is exactly the same one as [22] under DDPM-style definition. Case when t → 0. When t → 0, αt → 1. For simplicity suppose the closest sample to xt is unique. Let xclosest 0 = argminx0∈D∥√αtx0 − xt∥2, (15) d = min x0∈D\\{xclosest 0 } ∥√αtx0 − xt∥2 − ∥√αtxclosest 0 − xt∥2 > 0, (16) then 0 ≤ \r\r\r\r\r P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 − xclosest 0 \r\r\r\r\r (17) ≤ X x0∈D\\{xclosest} \r\r\r\r\r 1p 2π(1 − αt) exp \u0012−∥√αtx0 − xt∥2 + ∥√αtxclosest 0 − xt∥2 2(1 − αt) \u0013\r\r\r\r\r (18) ≤ X x0∈D\\{xclosest} \r\r\r\r\r 1p 2π(1 − αt) exp \u0012 − d 2(1 − αt) \u0013\r\r\r\r\r → 0 (19) as αt → 1, i.e., P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 → xclosest 0 . (20) 13Similarly P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 → 1, (21) and thus F(xt) → xclosest 0 , which completes the proof. Notably, when there are multiple closest samples, through similar analysis it is clear that F(xt) converges to their average. Case when t → T. When t → T, αt → 0, and thus N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 → N \u0000 xt; 0, I \u0001 , a constant for varying x0. Bringing this back to Eq. (14) and it holds that F(xt) = 1 n X x0∈D x0, (22) which completes the proof. B Implementation Details We provide the details of our experiment configuration in this section. All experiments are imple- mented by Pytorch and conducted on NVIDIA A100 40G GPUs. B.1 Benchmark Descriptions This section describes the benchmarks utilized in our experiments. B.1.1 Class-conditional Generation Tasks Food101 [4] The dataset consists of 101 food categories with a total of 101,000 images. For each class, 750 training images preserving some amount of noise and 250 manually reviewed test images are provided. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels. SUN397 [52] The SUN397 benchmark contains 108,753 images of 397 well-sampled categories from the origin Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database. The number of images varies across categories, but there are at least 100 images per category. We evaluate the methods on a random partition of the whole dataset with 76,128 training images, 10,875 validation images and 21,750 test images. DF20M [39] DF20 is a new fine-grained dataset and benchmark featuring highly accurate class labels based on the taxonomy of observations submitted to the Danish Fungal Atlas. The dataset has a well-defined class hierarchy and a rich observational metadata. It is characterized by a highly imbalanced long-tailed class distribution and a negligible error rate. Importantly, DF20 has no intersection with ImageNet, ensuring unbiased comparison of models fine-tuned from ImageNet checkpoints. Caltech101 [49] The Caltech 101 dataset comprises photos of objects within 101 distinct categories, with roughly 40 to 800 images allocated to each category. The majority of the categories have around 50 images. Each image is approximately 300×200 pixels in size. CUB-200-201 [49] CUB-200-2011 (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011) is an expansion of the CUB- 200 dataset by approximately doubling the number of images per category and adding new annotations for part locations. The dataset consists of 11,788 images divided into 200 categories. Artbench10 [29] ArtBench-10 is a class-balanced, standardized dataset comprising 60,000 high- quality images of artwork annotated with clean and precise labels. It offers several advantages over previous artwork datasets including balanced class distribution, high-quality images, and standardized data collection and pre-processing procedures. It contains 5,000 training images and 1,000 testing images per style. Oxford Flowers [ 36] The Oxford 102 Flowers Dataset contains high quality images of 102 commonly occurring flower categories in the United Kingdom. The number of images per category range between 40 and 258. This extensive dataset provides an excellent resource for various computer vision applications, especially those focused on flower recognition and classification. 14Cheese cake Fried  calamari Grilled salmonGyoza Panna cotta Food101 SUN397 Covered bridgeDamDinerJacuzziWet bar Caltech101 Dollar billHeadphoneNautilusPyramidStarﬁsh CUB-200-201 Brandt  cormorant Least  Flycatcher Great grey  shrike Tree  swallowBewick wren BaroqueImpressionism Post  impressionismRenaissanceUkiyoe Artbench10 DF20M Amanita  ceciliae Bas Russula  curtipes  Russula emetica  Pers Russula  luteotacta Rea Russula  xerampelina  Figure 7: Samples show of different datasets. Stanford Cars [25] In the Stanford Cars dataset, there are 16,185 images that display 196 distinct classes of cars. These images are divided into a training and a testing set: 8,144 images for training and 8,041 images for testing. The distribution of samples among classes is almost balanced. Each class represents a specific make, model, and year combination, e.g., the 2012 Tesla Model S or the 2012 BMW M3 coupe. B.1.2 Controllable Generation COCO [30] The MS COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. We adopt the version of 2017 where 164k images are split into 118k/5k/41k for training/validation/test. For each image, we randomly select one of its corresponding captions, and use detectors of Canny edge, (binarized) HED sketch, MIDAS depth/normal and Uniformer segmentation implemented in ControlNet to obtain the annotation control, and final construct the dataset of image-text-control pairs for training and evaluation. All controling condition has channel 1 except normal map and segmentation mask with channel 3. Ade20k [61] The Ade20k dataset is a semantic segmentation dataset containing nearly 21k/2k training/validation images annotated with pixel-wise segmentation mask of 149 categories of stuff and objects. For each image, we use the “default prompt” “a high-quality, detailed, and professional 15image” as adopted in ControlNet, and use Uniformer implemented in ControlNet to obtain the segmentation mask as the control to obtain the dataset of image-text-control pairs. B.2 Experiment Details Detailed Algorithm Process For all experiments, we first generate images of memory bank with the pre-trained model. We then construct conditioned dataset from memory bank with default condition (unconditional for class-conditional generation task and “default prompt” with generated control for controllable generation task). For each iteration, we devide a batch size of B by B/2 for knowledge retention and B/2 for knowledge reconsolidation, respectively, for fair comparision. Considering instability of weighted training loss with ξ(t) and ψ(t), we instead sample t from categorial distribution of ξ(t) and ψ(t) and calculate loss with the simple form. The pseudo-code of the overall algorithm process is shown in Algorithm 1.

To identify a simple signal indicating sudden convergence, we pre-collected a validation set of real images and compared the (dis-)similarity between their annotations and the corresponding generated controlled images. Figure 8 illustrates a noticeable “leap” during the training process, providing a clear indicator of sudden convergence. We established thresholds for quantitative evaluation based on test annotation similarity curves and combined them with qualitative human assessment to determine the number of steps as a metric for all tasks. C.1 Quantitative Metrics’ Details To efficiently and generally compare the (dis-)similarity between the original controlling conditions and the post-annotated conditions of the corresponding controlled generated samples, we employ the simplest reasonable metrics for each vision annotation, irrespective of task specificities such as label imbalance or semantic similarity. Specifically, we use Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) with Gaussian blurring for sparse classification (Edge and Sketch), mean-square error (MSE) for dense regression (Depth and Normal), and accuracy for dense classification (Segmentation). Detailed settings of the metrics and thresholds are provided in Table 4. Table 4: Detailed setting of quantitative metrics for controlled generation tasks. Edge Sketch Depth Normal Seg. (COCO) Seg.

By generating samples throughout the training process using a consistent random seed, we focus on identifying when and how these samples converge to their corresponding control conditions. As shown in Figure 9, our selected thresholds provide reasonable convergence discrimination across all six tasks, with Diff-Tuning consistently outperforming standard fine-tuning. 170 4k 8k 8.8k 9k 9.9k 12.5k 15k “Large factory smoke towers shadowed by a large building behind.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Depth 0 3k 6k 7.8k9k 10.3k 12k15k “Three young women are trying to catch a frisbee.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Normal 0 2k4k5.3k6k6.7k8k10k “A man in a wetsuit with surfboard standing on a beach.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Edge 0 1.5k 3k 3.2k 3.5k 3.8k 4.2k 5k “A flower vase is sitting on a porch stand.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Sketch 0 3k 6k 7.8k 12k13.9k15k20k “a professional, detailed, high-quality image” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Seg.

Red boxes refer to the occurence of “sudden conver- gence” 18Similarities Alone Are Imperfect It is important to note that our proposed similarity metric serves only to indicate the occurrence of convergence and does not accurately reflect sample quality or the degree of control, especially for converged samples. For example, Figure 10 compares generated samples from standard fine-tuning and our Diff-Tuning approach with edge controlling. The generated samples from Diff-Tuning are richer in detail but may score lower on edge similarity metrics, highlighting the limitations of similarity metrics and underscoring the necessity of human assessment. “vase with flowers”+ “a professional, detailed, high-quality image” StandardControlNet(0.82)Diff-Tu n i n gControlNet(0.76) Figure 10: Generated images using standard ControlNet (SSIM of 0.82) and Diff-Tuning ControlNet (SSIM of 0.76). Analyzing these cases, Diff-Tuning generates images with higher quality and more details hence results in a lower similarity, indicating the limitation of similarity metrics and the necessity of human assessment. D Limitations and Future Works Diff-Tuning consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods, demon- strating its efficacy across various downstream datasets and tasks. This section also discusses some limitations of Diff-Tuning and explores potential future directions to address these limitations. Necessity of a Pre-sampled Dataset Diff-Tuning involves constructing a pre-sampled augmented dataset for knowledge reconsolidation, which requires additional computational resources. As discussed in Section 4.4, the impact of the sample size indicates that even the smallest set of generated images outperforms baseline methods and the original source data, underscoring the value of this approach. Future work could focus on developing large-scale open-source generated samples and creating more sample-efficient augmented datasets. Extra Hyperparameters Diff-Tuning introduces additional hyperparameters, ξ(t) and ψ(t), as loss weighting coefficients based on the principle of the chain of forgetting. These introduce extra hyperparameter spaces. As detailed in Section 4.4, our analysis shows that simple designs for these coefficients perform well and robustly. Future research could aim to design more effective weighting coefficients to further enhance performance. 19",

In particular, they have shown excellent performance and flexibility in a wide range of image gener- ation settings, including unconditional [28, 47], class-conditional [22], and text-conditional image generation [1, 48, 55]. Consequently, improving diffusion models has garnered significant interest. The framework of diffusion models [20, 66, 71] comprises gradually corrupting the data towards a given noise distribution and its subsequent reverse process. A model is optimized by minimizing the weighted sum of denoising score-matching losses across various noise levels [20, 69] for learning the reverse process. This can be interpreted as diffusion training aiming to train a single shared model to ∗Co-first author 1,2,4,5Work done while at Riiid †Corresponding author 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2306.00354v3  [cs.CV]  30 Dec 2023denoising its input across various noise levels. Therefore, diffusion training is inherently multi-task learning (MTL) in nature, where each noise level represents a distinct denoising task. However, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective remains under- explored. In particular, sharing one model between tasks may lead to competition between conflicting tasks, resulting in a phenomenon known as negative transfer [24, 25, 57, 78], leading to poorer performance compared to learning individual tasks with separate models. Negative transfer has been a critical issue in MTL research, and related works have demonstrated that the performance of multi-task models can be improved by remediatingnegative transfer [24, 25, 57, 78, 83]. Considering these, we argue that negative transfer should be investigated in diffusion models, and if present, addressing it is a potential direction for improving diffusion models. In this paper, we characterize how multi-task diffusion model is, and whether there exists negative transfer in denoising tasks. In particular, (O1) we first observe that task affinity [12, 78] between two denoising tasks is negatively correlated with the difference in noise levels, indicating that they may be less conflict as the noise levels become more similar [78]. This suggests that adjacent denoising tasks should be considered more harmonious tasks than non-adjacent tasks in terms of noise levels. Next, (O2) we observe the presence of negative transfer from diffusion model training. During sampling within a specific timestep interval, utilizing a model trained exclusively on denoising tasks within that interval generates higher-quality samples compared to a model trained on all denoising tasks simultaneously. This finding implies that simultaneously learning all denoising tasks can cause degraded denoising within a specific time interval, indicating the occurrence of negative transfer. Based on these observations, we focus on improving diffusion models by addressingnegative transfer. To achieve this, we first propose to leverage the existing multi-task learning techniques, such as dealing with issues of conflicting gradients [5, 83], differences in gradient magnitudes [42, 46, 64], and imbalanced loss scales [4, 16, 29]. However, unlike previous MTL studies that typically focused on small sets of tasks, the presence of a large number of denoising tasks (≈ thousands) in diffusion models makes it computationally expensive since MTL methods generally require calculating per-task loss or gradient in each iteration [4, 5, 16, 24, 29, 42, 46, 64, 78, 83]. To address this, we propose a strategy that first clusters the entire denoising tasks and then applies multi-task learning methods to the resulting clusters. Specifically, inspired by (O1), we formulate the interval clustering problem which groups denoising tasks by pairwise disjoint timestep intervals. Based on the interval clustering, we propose timesteps, signal-to-noise ratios, and task affinity score- based interval clustering and show that these can be clustered by dynamic programming as [2, 76, 49]. Through our strategy, we can address the issue of negative transfer in diffusion models by allowing for efficient computation of multi-task learning methods. We evaluated our proposed methods through extensive experiments on widely-recognized datasets: FFHQ [27], CelebA-HQ [26], and ImageNet [7]. For a comprehensive analysis, we employed various models, including Ablated Diffusion Model (ADM) [8], Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) [56], and Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [52]. These models represent diverse diffusion architectures spanning pixel-space, latent-space, and transformer-based paradigms. Our results underscore a significant enhancement in image generation quality, attributed to a marked reduction in negative transfer. This affirms the merits of our clustering proposition and its synergistic integration with MTL techniques. 2 Related Work Diffusion Models Diffusion models [20, 66, 71] are a family of generative models that generate samples from noise via a learned denoising process. Diffusion models beat other likelihood-based models, such as autoregressive models [62, 75], flow models [9, 10], and variational autoencoders [32] in terms of sample quality, and sometimes outperform GANs [ 14] in certain cases [8]. Moreover, pre-trained diffusion models can be easily applied to downstream image synthesis tasks such as image editing [30, 45] and plug-and-play generation [13, 15]. From these advantages, several works have applied diffusion models for various domains [3, 23, 38, 44, 54] and large-scale models [48, 56, 58]. Several studies have focused on improving diffusion models in various aspects, such as architecture [1, 8, 28, 52, 82], sampling speed [33, 60, 67], and training objectives [6, 17, 31, 70, 74]. Among these, the most closely related studies are improving training objectives, as we aim to enhance optimization between denoising tasks from the perspective of multi-task learning (MTL). Several works [31, 70, 74] 2redesign training objectives to improve likelihood estimation. However, these objectives may lead to sample quality degradation and training instability and require additional techniques such as importance sampling [70, 74] and sophisticated parameterization [ 31] to be successfully applied. On the other hand, P2 [6] proposes a weighted training objective that prioritizes denoising tasks for certain noise levels, where the model is expected to learn perceptually rich features. Similar to P2, we aim to improve the sample quality of diffusion models from an MTL perspective, and we will show that our method is also beneficial to P2. As a concurrent work, MinSNR [ 17] shares a common insight with us that diffusion training is essentially multi-task learning. However, their observation lacks a direct connection to negative transfer in terms of sample quality. They address the instability and inefficiency of multi-task learning optimization in diffusion models, mainly due to a large number of denoising tasks. In contrast, our work delves deeper into exploring negative transfer and task affinity, and we propose the application of MTL methods through task clustering to overcome the identified challenges in MinSNR. Multi-Task Learning Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is an approach that trains a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously [57]. Although sharing parameters between tasks can reduce the overall number of parameters, it may also result in a negative transfer, causing performance degradation because of conflicting tasks during training procedure [24, 25, 57, 78]. Prior works have tracked down three causes of negative transfer: (1) conflicting gradient, (2) the difference in gradient magnitude, and (3) imbalanced loss scale. First, Conflicting gradients among different tasks may negate each other, resulting in poorer updates for a subset of, or even for all tasks. PCgrad [83] and Graddrop [5] mitigate this by projecting conflicting parts of gradients and dropping elements of gradients based on the degree of conflict, respectively. Second, tasks with larger gradients may dominate tasks with smaller gradients due to differences in gradient magnitude across tasks. Different optimization schemes have been proposed to equalize gradient magnitudes, including MGDA-UB [64], IMTL-G [42], and NashMTL [46]. Similarly, imbalanced loss scales may cause tasks with smaller losses to be dominated by those with larger losses. To balance task losses, uncertainty [29], task difficulty [16], and gradient norm [4] is exploited. Adapting MTL methods and negative transfer formulation to diffusion models is challenging since these techniques are typically designed for scenarios with a small number of tasks and easily measurable individual task performance. Our goal is to address this challenge and demonstrate that observing negative transfer in diffusion models and mitigating it can improve them. 3 Preliminaries and Observation We first provide the necessary background information on diffusion models and their multi-task nature. Next, we conduct analyses that yield two important observations: (O1) task affinity between two tasks is negatively correlated with the difference in noise levels, and(O2) negative transfer indeed exists in diffusion training, i.e., the model is overburdened with different, potentially conflicting tasks. 3.1 Preliminaries Diffusion model [20, 66, 71] consists of two processes: a forward process and a reverse process. The forward process q gradually injects noise into a datapoint x0 to obtain noisy latents {x1, . . . ,xT } as: q(xt|x0) = N(xt|atx0, σ2 t I), q (xt|xs) = N(xt|αt|sxs, (σ2 t − α2 t|sσ2 s)I), 1 ≤ s < t≤ T (1) where αt, σt characterize the signal-to-noise ratio SNR(t) = α2 t /σ2 t , and αt|s = αt/αs. Here, SNR(t) decreases in t, such that by the designated final timestep t = T, q(xT ) ≈ N(0, I). The reverse process is a parameterized model trained to restore the original data from data corrupted during the forward process. The widely adopted training scheme uses a simple noise-prediction objective [8, 20, 34, 56, 59] that trains the model to predict the noise component ϵ of the latent xt = αtx0 + σϵ, ϵ ∼ N(0, I). More formally, the objective is as follows: Lsimple = Et,x0,ϵ[Lt], where Lt = ||ϵ − ϵθ(xt, t)||2 2. (2) Let us denote by Dt the denoising task at timestep t trained by minimizing the loss Lt (Eq. 2). Then, since a diffusion model jointly learns multiple denoising tasks {Dt}t=1,...,T using a single shared model ϵθ, it can be regarded as a multi-task learner. Also, we denote by D[t1,t2] the set of tasks {Dt1 , Dt1+1, . . . ,Dt2 } henceforth. 31 200 400 600 800 10001 200 400 600 800 1000  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (a) ADM (timestep t) -9.0 -6.0 -3.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 9.0 -9.0 -6.0 -3.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 9.0  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (b) ADM (log-SNR) 1 200 400 600 800 10001 200 400 600 800 1000 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (c) LDM (timestep t) -8.0 -6.0 -4.0 -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 -8.0 -6.0 -4.0 -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (d) LDM (log-SNR) Figure 1: Task affinity scores plotted against timestep and log-SNR axes in ADM and LDM.

If NT Gis negative, D[·,·]-trained model outperforms the entire denoising tasks-trained model in terms of denoising latent {xt}t∈[·,·], showing the occurrence of negative transfer. Negative transfer occurs in both ADM and LDM. 3.2 Observation By considering diffusion training as a form of multi-task learning, we can analyze how the diffusion model learns the denoising task. We experimentally analyze diffusion models with two concepts in multi-task learning: 1) Task affinity [72, 12]: measuring which combinations of denoising tasks may yield a more positive impact on performance. 2) Negative transfer [ 68, 24, 25, 57, 78, 83]: degradation in denoising tasks caused by multi-task learning. We use a lightweight ADM [8] used in [6] and LDM [56] with FFHQ 256×256 dataset [27] for analyze diffusion models trained on both pixel and latent space. (O1) Task Affinity Analysis We first analyze how the denoising tasks D[1,T] relate to each other by measuring task affinities [72, 12]. In particular, we adopt the gradient direction-based task affinity score [78]: for two given tasks Di and Dj, we calculate the pairwise cosine similarity between gradients from each task loss, i.e., ∇θLi and ∇θLj, then average the similarities across training iterations. Task affinity score assumes that cooperative (conflicting) tasks produce similar (conflicting) gradient directions, and it has been to correlate with the MTL model’s overall performance [ 78]. Although there have been attempts to divide diffusion model phases using signal-to-noise ratio [6] and a trace of covariance of training targets [81], we are the first to provide an explicit and fine-grained analysis of task affinities among denoising tasks. In Fig. 1, we visualize the task affinity scores among denoising tasks, for both ADM and LDM, with both timestep and log-SNR as axes. As can be seen in Fig. 1, task affinity between two tasks Di, Dj is high for neighboring tasks, i.e., i ≈ j, and decreases smoothly as the difference in SNRs (or timesteps) increases. This suggests that tasks sharing temporal/noise-level proximity can be cooperatively learned without significant conflict. Also, this result hints at the possibility that denoising tasks for vastly different SNRs (distant in timesteps) may potentially be conflicting. (O2) Negative Transfer Analysis Next, we show that there exist negative transfers among different denoising tasks D[1,T]. Negative transfer refers to a multi-task learner’s performance degradation due to task conflicts, and it can be identified by observing the performance gap between a multi-task learner and specific-task learners. For ease of observation, we group up tasks by intervals, based on 4the observation (O1) that more neighboring tasks in timesteps have higher task affinity. Specifically, we investigate whether the task group D[t1,t2] suffers negative impacts from the remaining tasks. To quantify the negative transfer, we follow the procedure: First, we generate samples{˜x0} using a model trained on all denoising tasks D[1,T]. Next, we repeat the same sampling procedure, except we replace the model with a model trained on D[t1,t2] for the latent {xt}t∈[t1,t2]; We denote the resulting samples by {˜x[t1,t2] 0 }. If {˜x[t1,t2] 0 } exhibits superior quality compared to {˜x0}, it indicates that the model trained solely on D[t1,t2] performs better in denoising the latent {xt}t∈[t1,t2] than the model trained on the entire denoising task. This suggests that D[t1,t2] suffers from negative transfer by learning other tasks. More formally, given a performance metric P, FID [18] in this paper, we define the negative transfer gap: NT G(D[t1,t2]) := P({˜x[t1,t2] 0 }) − P({˜x0}), (3) where NT G <0 indicates that negative transfer occurs. The relationship between the negative transfer gap in previous literature and our negative transfer gap is described in Appendix A. We visualize the negative transfers among denoising tasks for both lightweight ADM [ 6, 8] and LDM [56] in Fig. 2. The results indicate that negative transfer occurs in three out of the five considered task groups for both models. Notably, negative transfers often have a significant impact, such as a 7.56 increase in FID for ADM in the worst case. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is room for improving the performance of diffusion models by mitigating negative transfer, which motivates us to leverage well-designed MTL methods for diffusion training. 4 Methodology In Section 3.2, we make two observations: (O1) Denoising tasks with a larger difference in t and SNR(t) exhibit lower task affinity,(O2) Negative transfer occurs in diffusion training. Inspired by these observations, we aim to remediate the negative transfer in diffusion by leveraging MTL methods. Although MTL methods are reported effective when there are only a few tasks, they are impractical for diffusion models with a large number of denoising tasks since they require computing per-task gradients or loss at each iteration. In this section, to deal with challenges, we propose a strategy that first groups the denoising tasks as task clusters and then applies the multi-task learning methods by regarding each task cluster as one distinct task. 4.1 Interval Clustering Here, we first introduce a scheme that groups all denoising tasks D[1,T] into a small number of task clusters. This is a necessary step for applying well-established MTL methods, for they usually involve computationally expensive subroutines such as computing per-task gradients or loss in each training iteration. Our key idea is to enforce temporal proximity of denoising tasks within task clusters, given our observation (O1) that task affinity is higher for tasks closer in timesteps. Therefore, we assign tasks in pairwise disjoint time intervals. To obtain the disjoint time intervals, we leverage an interval clustering algorithm [ 2, 49] that op- timizes for various clustering costs. In our case, interval clustering assigns diffusion timesteps X = {1, . . . , T} to k contiguous intervals I1, . . . , Ik, with `k i=1 Ii ∩ X= X, where ` denotes disjoint union. Let Ii = [li, ri], li ≤ ri for i = 1, . . . , k, then we have l1 = 1, and ri = li+1 − 1 (i < kand rk = T). The interval clustering problem is defined as: min l1=1<l2<...<lk kX i=1 Lcluster(Ii ∩ X), (4) where Lcluster denotes the cluster cost. Generally, it is known that an interval clustering problem of n data points with k intervals can be solved via dynamic programming in O(n2kω(n)) [49], where ω(n) is the time required to calculate the one-cluster cost for Lcluster(X). If the size of each cluster is too small, it is challenging to learn the corresponding task cluster, so we add constraints on the cluster size for dynamic programming. More details regarding the dynamic programming algorithm can be found in Appendix G. It remains to design the clustering cost function Lcluster to optimize for. We present three clustering cost functions: timestep-based, SNR-based, and gradient-based. 51. Timestep-based Clustering Cost Intuitively, one simple clustering cost is based on timesteps. We use the absolute timestep difference for the clustering objective by setting Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) =Pri t=li ||ti center − t||1 1 in Eq. 4 where ti center denotes the center of interval Ii. The resulting intervals divide up the timesteps into k uniform intervals. 2. SNR-based Clustering Cost Another useful metric to characterize a denoising task is its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Indeed, it has been previously observed that a denoising task encounters perceptually different noisy inputs depending on its SNR [ 6]. Also, we already observed that denoising tasks with similar SNRs show high task affinity scores (see Section 3.2). Based on this, we use the absolute log-SNR difference for clustering cost. We define the clustering cost as Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) = Pri t=li ||log SNR(ti center) − log SNR(t)||1 1. 3. Gradient-based Clustering Cost Finally, we consider the gradient direction-based task affinity scores (see Section 3.2 for a definition) for clustering cost. Task affinity scores have been used as a metric to group cooperative tasks [78]. Based on a similar intuition, we design a clustering cost as follows: Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) = −Pri t=li TAS(ti center, t) where TAS(·) is the gradient-based task affinity score. While leveraging more fine-grained information regarding task affinities, this cost function requires computing and storing gradients throughout training. 4.2 Incorporating MTL Methods into Diffusion Model Training After dividing the denoising tasks into task clusters via interval clustering, we apply multi-task learning methods to the resulting task clusters. As mentioned in Section 2, previous multi-task learning works have tracked down the following causes for negative transfer: (1) conflicting gradient, (2) difference in gradient magnitude, and (3) imbalanced loss scale. In this work, we leverage one representative method that tackles each of the causes mentioned above, namely, (1) PCgrad [83], (2) NashMTL [46], and (3) Uncertainty Weighting [29]. For each training step in diffusion modeling, we compute the noise prediction loss Ll for the l-th data within the minibatch. As shown in Eq 2, calculating Ll involves sampling the timestep tl, in which case Ll is a loss incurred on the denoising task Dtl . We may then assign Li to the appropriate task cluster by considering the corresponding timestep. Subsequently, we may group up the losses as {LIi}i=1,...,k, where LIi is the loss for the i-th task cluster. (More details in Appendix C) 1. PCgrad [83] In each iteration, PCgrad projects the gradient of a task onto the normal plane of the gradient of another task when there is a conflict between their gradients. Specifically, PCgrad first calculates the per-interval gradient ∇θLIi. Then, if the other interval gradient ∇θLIj for i ̸= j has negative cosine similarity with ∇θLIi, it projects ∇θLIi onto the normal plane of ∇θLIj . PCgrad repeats this process with all of the other interval gradients for all interval gradients, resulting in a projected gradient per interval. Finally, model parameters are updated with the summation of projected gradients. 2. NashMTL [46] In NashMTL, the aggregation of per-task gradients is treated as a bargaining game. It aims to update model parameters with weighted summed gradients ∆θ = Pk i=i αi∇θLIi by obtaining the Nash bargaining solution to determine αi, where ∆θ is in the ball of radius ϵ centered zero, Bϵ. They define the utility function for each player as ui = ⟨∇θLIi, ∆θ⟩, then the unique Nash bargaining solution can be obtained by arg max∆θ∈Bϵ P i log(ui). By denoting G as matrix whose columns contain the gradients ∇θLIi, α ∈ Rk + is the solution to G⊺Gα = 1/α where 1/α is the element-wise reciprocal. To avoid the optimization to obtain α for each iteration, they update α once every few iterations. 3. Uncertainty Weighting (UW) [29] UW uses task-dependent (homoscedastic) uncertainty to weight task cluster losses. By utilizing observation noise parameter σi for i-th task clusters, the total loss function is P i LIi/σ2 i + log(σi). As the noise parameter for the i-th task clusters loss σi increases, the weight of LIi decreases, and vice versa. The σi is discouraged from increasing too much by regularizing with log(σi). 5 Experiments In this section, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by addressing the negative transfer issue in diffusion training. First, we provide the comparative evaluation in Section 5.1, where 6Table 1: Quantitative comparison to vanilla training (Vanilla) on the unconditional generation.

Next, we compare previous loss weighting methods for diffusion models to UW with interval clustering in Section 5.2, verifying our superior effectiveness to existing methods. Then, we analyze the behavior of adopted MTL methods, which serve to explain the effectiveness of our method in Section 5.3. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be readily combined with more sophisticated training objectives to boost performance even further in Section 5.4. Extensive information on all our experiments can be found in Appendix E. 5.1 Comparative Evaluation Experimental Setup Here, we demonstrate that incorporating MTL methods into diffusion training improves the performance of diffusion models. For comparison, we consider unconditional and class-conditional image generation. For unconditional image generation, we used FFHQ [27] and CelebA-HQ [26] datasets, where all images were resized to 256 × 256. For class-conditional image generation experiments, we employed the ImageNet dataset [7], also resized to 256 × 256 resolution. For architecture, we adopt widely recognized architectures for image generation. Specifically, we use the lightweight ADM [6, 8] and LDM [56] for unconditional image generation, while employing DiT-S/2 [52] with classifier-free guidance [19] for class-conditional image generation. We train the model using our method: We consider every possible pair of (1) interval clustering (timestep-, SNR-, and gradient-based) and (2) MTL method (PCgrad, NashMTL, and Uncertainty Weighting (UW)), and report the results. We used k = 5 in interval clustering throughout experiments. For evaluation metrics, we use FID [ 18] and precision [ 36] for measuring sample quality, and recall [36] for assessing sample diversity and distribution coverage. IS [61] is additionally used for the evaluation metric in the class-conditional image generation setting. Finally, for sample generation, we use DDIM [67] sampler with 50 steps for unconditional generation and DDPM 250 steps for class conditional generation, and all evaluation metrics are calculated using 10k generated samples. Comparison in Unconditional Generation As seen in Table 1 our method significantly improves performance upon conventionally trained diffusion models (denoted vanilla in the table). In particular, there is an improvement in FID in all cases, and an improvement in precision scores in all but two cases, which highlights the efficacy of our method. Also, given strong results for both pixel- and latent-space models, we can reasonably infer that our method is generally applicable. We also observe the distinct characteristics of each multi-task learning method considered. Uncertainty Weighting tends to achieve higher improvements in sample quality compared to PCgrad and NashMTL. Indeed, UW achieves superior FID and Precision for ADM, while excelling in Precision for LDM. 71.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 30 40 50 60 70 80FID 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 20 30 40 50 60IS 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60Precision 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50 0.52 0.54Recall Vanilla UW-Time UW-Grad UW-SNR Nash-Time Nash-Grad Nash-SNR PCgrad-Time PCgrad-Grad PCgrad-SNR Figure 3: Quantitative comparison to vanilla training (Vanilla) on ImageNet 256 ×256 dataset with DiT-S/2 architecture and classifier-free guidance.

Meanwhile, NashMTL scores higher in recall and lower in precision compared to other methods, suggesting it has better distribution coverage while sacrificing sample quality. Finally, PCgrad tends to show a balanced performance in terms of precision and recall. We further look into behaviors of different MTL methods in Section 5.3. Due to space constraints, we provide a comprehensive collection of generated samples in Appendix F. In summary, diffusion models trained with our method produce more realistic and high-fidelity images compared to conventionally trained diffusion models. Comparison in Class-Conditional Generation We illustrate the results of quantitative comparison on class-conditional generation in Fig. 3. The results show that our methods outperform vanilla training in FID, IS, and Precision. In particular, UW and Nash-MTL significantly boost these metrics, showing superior improvement in generation quality. These results further support the generalizability of MTL methods through the interval clustering on class-conditional generation and the transformer-based diffusion model. 5.2 Comparison to Loss Weighting Methods Since UW is a loss weighting method, validating the superiority of UW with interval clustering compared to previous loss weighting methods such as P2 [ 6] and MinSNR [ 17] highlights the effectiveness of our method. We name UW by incorporating interval clustering as Addressing Negative Transfer (ANT)-UW. We trained DiT-L/2 with MinSNR and UW with k = 5 on the ImageNet across 400K iterations, using a batch size of 256. All methods are trained by AdamW optimizer [43] with a learning rate of 1e − 4. Table 2 shows that ANT-UW dramatically outperforms MinSNR, emphasizing the effectiveness of our method. An essential note is that the computational cost of ANT-UW remains remarkably similar to vanilla training as shown in Section 5.3, ensuring that our enhanced performance does not come at the expense of computational efficiency. Additionally, we refer to the results in [50], showing that our ANT-UW outperforms P2 and MinSNR when DIT-L/2 is trained on the FFHQ dataset. 5.3 Analysis To provide a better understanding of our method, we present various analysis results here. Specifically, we compare the memory and runtime of MTL methods, analyze the behavior of MTL methods adopted, provide a convergence analysis, and assess the extent to which negative transfer has been addressed. 8I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 0.00 0.42 0.64 0.74 0.80 0.42 0.00 0.54 0.66 0.72 0.64 0.54 0.00 0.53 0.61 0.74 0.66 0.53 0.00 0.35 0.80 0.72 0.61 0.35 0.00 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad 0 1 2 3 4 Iteration ×105 10 1 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0 1 2 3 4 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 4: Behavior of multi-task learning methods across training iterations.

Compared to baselines, all methods exhibit fast convergence and achieve good final performance. Memory and Runtime Comparison We first compared the memory usage and runtime between MTL methods and vanilla training for a deeper understanding of their cost. We conducted measure- ments of memory usage and runtime with k = 5 on the FFHQ dataset using the LDM architecture and timestep-based clustering, and the results are shown in Table 3. PCgrad has a slower speed of 1.523 iterations/second compared to vanilla training, but its GPU memory usage is lower due to the partitioning of minibatch samples. Meanwhile, NashMTL has a runtime of 2.011 iterations/second. Even though NashMTL uses more GPU memory, it has a better runtime than PCgrad because it com- putes per-interval gradients occasionally. Concurrently, UW shows similar runtime and GPU memory usage as vanilla training, which is attributed to its use of weighted loss and a single backpropagation process. Behavior of MTL Methods We analyze the behavior of different multi-task learning methods during training. For PCgrad, we calculate the average number of gradient conflicts between task clusters per iteration. For UW, we visualize the weights allocated to the task cluster losses over training iterations. Finally, for NashMTL, we visualize the weights allocated to per-task-cluster gradients over training iterations. We used LDM trained on FFHQ for our experiments. Although we only report results for time-based interval clustering for conciseness, we note that MTL methods exhibit similar behavior across different clustering methods. Results obtained using other clustering methods can be found in Appendix D.1. The resulting visualizations are provided in Fig. 4. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the task pair that shows the most gradient conflicts is I1 and I5, namely, task clusters apart in timesteps. This result supports our hypothesis that temporally distant denoising tasks may be conflicting, and as seen in Section 5.1, PCgrad seems to mitigate this issue. Also, as depicted in Fig. 4b and 4b, both UW and NashMTL tend to allocate higher weights to task clusters that handle noisier inputs, namely, I4, I5. This result suggests that handling noisier inputs may be a difficult task that is underrepresented in conventional diffusion training. Faster Convergence In Fig. 5, we plot the trajectory of the FID score over training iterations, as observed while training on FFHQ. We can observe that all our methods enjoy faster convergence and better final performance compared to the conventionally trained model. Notably, for pixel space 9[1, 200] [201, 400] [401, 600] [601, 800] [801, 1000] -7.94 -4.40 -0.85 2.70 6.24 ADM NTG  (FID) Vanilla PCgrad-Time PCgrad-SNR PCgrad-Grad Nash-Time Nash-SNR Nash-Grad UW-Time UW-SNR UW-Grad [1, 200] [201, 400] [401, 600] [601, 800] [801, 1000] -0.90 -0.53 -0.15 0.22 0.60 LDM NTG (FID) Figure 6: Negative transfer gap (NTG) comparison on the FFHQ dataset. Integration of MTL methods tends to improve the negative transfer gap. Methods that fail to improve NTG in areas where the baseline records low NTG tend to achieve lesser improvements in the baseline. diffusion (ADM), UW converges extremely rapidly, while beating the vanilla method by a large margin. Overall, these results show that our method may not only make diffusion training more effective but also more efficient. Reduced Negative Transfer Gap We now demonstrate that our proposed method indeed mitigates the negative transfer gap we observed in Section 3.2. We used the same procedure introduced in Section 3.2 to calculate the negative transfer gap for all methods considered, for the FFHQ dataset. As shown in Fig. 6 our methods improve upon negative transfer gaps. Specifically, for tasks that exhibit severe negative transfer gaps in the baseline (e.g., [601, 800], [801, 1000] for ADM, and [401, 600], [601, 800] for LDM), our methods mitigate the negative transfer gap for most cases, even practically removing it in certain cases. Another interesting result to note is that models less effective in reducing negative transfer (NashMTL-SNR for LDM and PCgrad-Grad for ADM) indeed show worse FID scores, which supports our hypothesis that resolving negative transfer leads to performance gain. We also note that even the worst-performing methods still beat the vanilla model. 5.4 Combining MTL Methods with Sophisticated Training Objectives Table 4: Combining our method with P2 on the FFHQ dataset.

Specifically, we train an LDM by applying both UW and PCgrad on top of the P2 objective [6] and evaluate the performance on the FFHQ dataset. We chose UW and PCgrad based on a previous finding that combining the two methods leads to performance gain [41]. Also, we chose the gradient-based clustering method due to its effectiveness for LDM on FFHQ. As seen in Table 4, when combined with P2, our method improves the FID from 7.21 to 5.84. 6 Conclusion In this work, we studied the problem of better training diffusion models, with the distinction of reducing negative transfer between denoising tasks in a multi-task learning perspective. Our key contribution is to enable the application of existing multi-task learning techniques, such as PCgrad and NashMTL, that were challenging to implement due to the increasing computation costs associated with the number of tasks, by clustering the denoising tasks based on their various task affinity scores. Our experiments validated that the proposed method effectively mitigated negative transfer and improved image generation quality. Overall, our findings contribute to advancing diffusion models. Starting from our work, we believe that addressing and overcoming negative transfer can be the future direction to improve diffusion models. 10References [1] Yogesh Balaji, Seungjun Nah, Xun Huang, Arash Vahdat, Jiaming Song, Karsten Kreis, Miika Aittala, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, Bryan Catanzaro, et al. ediffi: Text-to-image diffusion models with an ensemble of expert denoisers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01324, 2022. 1, 2, 17 [2] Richard Bellman.

For the source task Tsrc and the target task Ttgt, the negative transfer can be defined as the phenomenon that the source task negatively transfer to the target task. Denote the model trained on both source and target task as Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) and the model only trained on the target task as Θ(Ttgt). With performance measure P for the model on Ttgt, negative transfer can be quantified by utilizing negative transfer gap (NT G): NT G(Ttgt, Tsrc) = P(Θ(Ttgt)) − P(Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc)). (5) For P, higher is better, NT G >0 indicates that negative transfer occurs, showing that additionally training on Tsrc negatively affects the learning of Ttgt. In our study of negative transfer in diffusion models, the target task involves denoising tasks within a specific timestep interval as Ttgt = D[t1,t2], while the source task comprises the remaining denoising tasks as Tsrc = D[1,T] \\ D[t1,t2]. However, since a model trained only a subset of entire denoising tasks cannot generate samples properly, we cannot utilize the sample quality metrics (e.g. FID [18]) for P to measure P(Θ(Ttgt)) in Eq. 5 for arbitrary timestep intervals. This is a different point from a typical MTL setting, where the performance of each task can be measured. Alternatively, we redefine NT Gwith the difference in sample quality resulting from denoising by different models, Θ(Ttgt) and Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc), in the [t1, t2] interval. During the sampling procedure with a model trained on entire denoising tasks, we use Θ(Ttgt) or Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) in [t1, t2]. Denote the resulting samples with Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) as {˜x0} and the resulting samples with Θ(Ttgt) as {˜x[t1,t2] 0 }. Then, by comparing the quality of these samples as Eq. 3, we can measure how much the denoising of [t1, t2] degrades in terms of sampling quality. Furthermore, the success of multi-expert denoisers in prior studies [37, 13, 1] suggests the potential existence of negative transfer. By distinctly separating parameters for denoising tasks, they might mitigate this negative transfer, leading to enhanced performance in their generation. B Detailed Experimental Settings for Observational Study In this section, we provide the details on experimental settings in Section 3. The training details and the architectures used are the same as those in Section 5. All experiments are conducted with a single A100 GPU and with FFHQ dataset [27]. For the pixel-space diffusion model, we use the lightweight ADM as same in [ 6]. It inherits the architecture of ADM [8], but it uses fewer base channels, fewer residual blocks, and a self-attention with a single resolution. Specifically, the model uses one residual block per resolution with 128 base channels and 16×16 self-attention with 64 head channels. A linear schedule with T = 1000 is used for diffusion scheduling. We referenced the training scripts in the official code2 for implementation. For the latent-space diffusion model, we use the LDM architecture as the same settings for FFHQ experiments in [ 56]. Specifically, an LDM-4-VQ encoder and decoder are used, in which the resolution of latent vectors is reduced by four times compared to the original images and has a vector quantization layer with 8092 codewords. The denoising model has 224 base channels with multipliers for each resolution as 1, 2, 3, 4 and has two residual blocks per resolution. Self-attention with 32 head channels is used for 32, 16, and 8 resolutions. For diffusion scheduling, the linear schedule with T = 1000 is used. We conducted experiments with the official code3. In general, we utilized the pre-trained weights provided by LDM. However, if our retraining results demonstrated superior performance, we reported them. Task Affinity Analysis To measure the task affinity score between denoising tasks, we first calculate ∇θLt for t = 1, . . . , Tevery 10K iterations during training. The gradient is calculated with 1000 samples in the training dataset. Then, the pairwise cosine similarity of the gradient is computed and 2https://github.com/jychoi118/P2-weighting 3https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion 17I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000014 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad /uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000016/uni00000017 /uni0000002c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051×/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I1 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I2 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I3 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I4 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 7: Behavior of multi-task learning methods through SNR-based interval clustering across training iterations. A similar trend as in Fig. 3 is observed. their cosine similarities calculated by every 10K iterations are averaged. Finally, we can plot the average cosine similarity against the timestep axis as in Fig. 1. For plotting them against the log-SNR axis, the values of the axis were adjusted, and the empty parts were filled with linear interpolation. For ADM and LDM, the pairwise cosine similarity between gradients is calculated during 1M training iterations and 400K training iterations, respectively. Negative Transfer Analysis To calculate the negative transfer gap in Eq. 3, we need to additionally train the model on denoising tasks within specific timestep interval[t1, t2]. Since we plot five intervals [1, 200], [201, 400], [401, 600], [601, 800], and [801, 1000], we trained the model on denoising tasks for each interval. Each model is trained for 600K iterations in ADM and 300K iterations in LDM on the FFHQ dataset. For the model trained on entire denoising tasks, we used the trained model the same as in Section 5.1. ADM is trained on 1M iterations and LDM is trained on 400K iterations. All of these models are trained with the same batch size and learning rate as experiments in Section 5.1 (See Appendix E). DDIM 50-step sampler [ 67] was used for the generation. FID is calculated with Clean-FID [ 51] by setting the entire 70K FFHQ dataset as reference images. Since the official code of Clean-FID4 supports FID calculation with statistics from these reference images, we used it and reported FID with 10k generated images. C Implementation Details for MTL methods We describe how MTL methods are applied in Section 4.2. To be more self-contained, we hereby present implementation details for MTL methods. For the implementation of MTL methods, we used the official code of LibMTL [39]5. NashMTL [46] supports practical speed-up by updating gradient weights α every few iterations, not every iteration. We utilize this by updatingα every 25 training iterations. D Additional Experimental Results We present additional experimental results to supplement the empirical findings presented in Section 5. In Section D.1, we provide visualizations of the behavior of MTL methods with other clustering meth- ods that were not covered in Section 5.3. Furthermore, we examine the impact of our hyperparameter, the number of clusters k, in Section D.2. To validate the effectiveness of interval clustering compared to other clustering methods, we present additional results in Section D.3. In Section D.4, we delve deeper into comparing the performance of stronger MTL baselines such as Linear Scalarization (LS) [80, 35] and Random Loss Weighting (RLW) [40] with our proposed approach. 4https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid 5https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL 18I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000016 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001b /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad /uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000016/uni00000017 /uni0000002c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051×/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I1 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I2 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I3 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I4 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 8: Behavior of multi-task learning methods through gradient-based interval clustering across training iterations.

However, we present these results in Fig. 7 and 8, which show similar trends to the observations depicted in Fig. 4. These findings suggest valuable insights into the behavior of MTL methods, regardless of the clustering objectives. Firstly, we observed a notable increase in the occurrence of conflicting gradients as the timestep difference between tasks increased. This observation suggests that the temporal distance between denoising tasks plays a crucial role in determining the frequency of conflicting gradients. Secondly, we noted that both loss and gradient balancing methods assign higher weights to task clusters with higher levels of noise. This finding indicates that these methods allocate more importance to the noisier tasks. D.2 Analysis: The Number of Interval Clusters To understand the impacts of the number of clustersk, we conducted experiments by varyingk with 2, 5, and 8. We trained a model for timestep-based, SNR-based, and gradient-based clustering with each k, resulting in nine trained models. For MTL methods, we used combined methods with UW [29] and PCgrad [83] as in Section 5.4. All training configurations such as learning rate and training iterations are the same as in Section 5.1. We evaluate 10K generated samples from the DDIM 50-step sampler [67] for all methods with the FID score [51, 18]. Table 5 shows the results. Notably, we made an intriguing observation regarding the integration of MTL methods with only two clusters, which resulted in a noteworthy enhancement in FID scores. Additionally, we found that increasing the number of clusters, denoted ask, from 2 to 5 also exhibited a positive impact on improving FID scores. However, our findings indicated that further increasing k from 5 to 8 did not yield significant improvements and resulted in similar outcomes. From these results, we conjecture that increasing the number of clusters to greater than five has no significant effect. 19Table 7: The results of Random Loss Weighting (RLW) and Linear Scalarization (LS) on the FFHQ dataset in ADM architecture.

For grouping N-tasks in deep neural networks, the early attempt [ 72] established a two-stage procedure: (1) compute MTL performance gain for all task combinations and (2) search best groups for maximizing MTL performance gain across the groups. However, performing (1) requires huge computation since MTL performance gain should be measured for all2N −1 combinations. Therefore, they reduce computation by HOA, which utilizes MTL gains on only pairwise task combinations. Also, the HOA scheme is inherited by the following work, task affinity grouping [12], which uses their defined task affinity score instead of MTL gains. Different from these works, our interval clustering aims to group the tasks with interval constraints. Table 6: Comparison inter- val clustering and high or- der approximation-based task grouping. DDIM-50 step sam- pler is used. Clustering FID-10k HOA 9.873 Interval 9.033 For a fair comparison, we use a pairwise gradient similarity averaged across training iterations between denoising tasks for the objective of HOA-based grouping and interval clustering. In this case, the HOA- based grouping becomes cosine similarity grouping used in [ 12], and interval clustering becomes gradient-based clustering in our method. However, for HOA-based grouping, a solution of brute force searching with branch-and-bound-like algorithm [72, 12] requires computational complexity of O(2N ). It incurs enormous costs in diffusion with many denoising tasks. Therefore, we use a beam- search scheme in [68]. We set the number of clusters as 5 for both methods. We apply the combined method with UW [29] and PCgrad [83] as in Section 5.3 for the resulting clusters from both HOA-based grouping and interval clustering. We trained the model on the FFHQ dataset [27] and used LDM architecture [56]. All training configurations are the same as in Section 5.1. For evaluation metrics, we use FID and its configurations are the same as in Section 5.1. Table 6 shows the results, indicating that the interval clustering outperforms HOA-based task grouping. D.4 Comparison to Random Loss Weighting and Linear Scalarization Linear Scalarization (LS) [ 80, 35] and Random Loss Weighting (RLW) [ 40] can serve as strong baselines for MTL methods. Therefore, validating the superiority of our method compared to theirs can emphasize the necessity of applying sophisticated MTL methods such as UW, PCgrad, and NashMTL. Accordingly, we provide the results of comparative experiments for LS and RLW on the FFHQ dataset using ADM architecture in Table 7. We note that all experimental configuration is the same as in vanilla training in Section 5.1. As shown in the results, LS achieves slightly worse performance than vanilla training, which suggests that simply re-framing the diffusion training task as an MTL task and applying LS is not enough. Also, RLW achieves much worse performance compared to vanilla training. It appears that the randomness introduced by loss weighting interferes with diffusion training. These results indicate that sophisticated MTL methods are indeed responsible for significant performance gain. 20E Detailed Experimental Settings in Section 5 In this section, we describe the details of experimental settings in Section 5. For validating the effectiveness in both pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models in unconditional generation, we used ADM [8] and LDM [56] as same in our observational study (refer to details of architecture in Appendix B). E.1 Detailed Settings of Comparative Evaluation and Analysis (Section 5.1 and 5.3) A single A100 GPU is used for experiments in Section 5.1 and 5.3. Setups for Unconditional Generation We trained the models on FFHQ [27] and CelebA-HQ [26] datasets. All training was performed with AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate as 1e−4 or 2e−5, and better results were reported. For ADM, we trained 1M iteration with batch size 8 for the FFHQ dataset and trained 400K iterations with batch size 16 for the CelebA-HQ dataset. For LDM, we trained 400K iterations with batch size 30 for both FFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets. We generate 10K samples with a DDIM-50 step sampler and measure FID [18], Precision [36], and Recall [36] scores. For all evaluation metrics, we use all training data as reference data. FID is calculated with clean-FID [51], and Precision and Recall are computed with publicly available code 6. All analyses are conducted above trained models. Setups for Class-Conditional Generation We trained the DiT-S/2 [52] on ImageNet dataset [7]. All training was performed with the AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate of 1e−4 or 2e − 5, and better results were reported. As in DiT [ 52], we applied the classifier-free guidance [ 19] and trained 800K iterations with a batch size of 50. All samples are generated by a DDPM 250-step sampler. For evaluation metrics, we follow the evaluation protocol in ADM [ 8], by using their evaluation code7. We used the cosine schedule [47] for noise scheduling and SD-XL V AE [53] for our V AE. E.2 Detailed Settings of Comparison to Loss Weighting Methods (Section 5.2) We trained the DiT-L/2 [52] on ImageNet dataset [7]. All training was performed with the AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate of 1e−4. As in DiT [ 52], we applied the classifier-free guid- ance [19] and trained 400K iterations with a batch size of 256. All samples are generated by a DDPM 250-step sampler and classifier-guidance scale of 1.5. We used the cosine schedule [47] for noise scheduling. For experiments, we used 8 A100 GPUs. E.3 Detailed Settings of Combining MTL Methods with Sophisticated Training Objectives (Section 5.4) We trained three different models: vanilla LDM, vanilla LDM with P2 [6], and vanilla LDM with P2, PCgrad [ 83], and UW [ 29] applied simultaneously. All training configurations are the same in Section 5.1 but we use 500K iterations. We generate 50K samples for evaluation with a DDIM 200-step sampler and evaluate FID. F Qualitative Results In this section, we provide qualitative comparison results, which were omitted from the main paper due to space constraints. In Figure 9, 10, 11 and 12, we visualize the generated images by all models that are used for results in Table 1. As shown in the results, we can observe that incorporating MTL methods for diffusion training can improve the quality of generated images. One noteworthy observation is that UW [29] tends to generate higher-quality images compared to NashMTL [46] and PCGrad [83]. This finding aligns with the results observed in Table 1. Moreover, we plot the randomly selected samples from 50K generated data in Fig. 13. Despite being randomly selected, the majority of the generated images exhibit remarkable fidelity. 6https://github.com/youngjung/improved-precision-and-recall-metric-pytorch 7https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion/tree/main/evaluations 21(a) Vanila  (b) PCgrad - Timestep (c) PCgrad - SNR (d) PCgrad - Gradient (e) Nash - Timestep (f) Nash - SNR (g) Nash - Gradient (h) UW - Timestep (i) UW - SNR (j) UW - Gradient Figure 9: Qualitative comparison of ADM trained on the FFHQ dataset.

G Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Interval Clustering In this section, we introduce the algorithm for optimizing the interval cluster and the implementation details. The optimal solution of interval clustering can be found using dynamic programming for a Lcluster function [ 2, 49, 76]. The sub-problem is then defined as finding the minimum cost of clustering X1,i = {1, . . . , i} into m clusters. By saving the minimum cost of clustering X1,i = {1, . . . , i} into m clusters to the matrix D[i, m], the value in D[T, k] represents the minimum clustering costs for the original problem in Eq. 4. For some timestep m ≤ j ≤ i, D[j − 1, m− 1] must contain the minimum costs for clustering X1,j−1 into (m −1) clusters [49, 76]. This establishes the optimal substructure for dynamic programming, which leads to the recurrence equation as follows: D[i, m] = min m≤j≤i \b D[j − 1, m− 1] + Lcluster(Xj,i) \t , 1 ≤ i ≤ T, 1 ≤ m ≤ k. (6) To obtain the optimal intervalsl1, . . . , lk, we use S[i, m] to record the argmin solution of Eq. 6. Then, we backtrack the solution in O(k) time from S[T, k] by assigning lm = S[lm+1 −1, m] from m = k to m = 1 by initializing lk = S[T, k]. Interval clustering with SNR-based or gradient-based objectives can produce unbalanced sizes of each interval, which causes unbalanced allocation of task clusters due to randomly sampled timestep t. Therefore, we add constraints on the size of each cluster to avoid seriously unbalanced task clusters. To add constraints on the size of each cluster ni = |Ii| = ri − li + 1 for i = 1, ..., k, we define the lower and upper bounds of it as mI and MI with mI ≤ ni k ≤ MI. In Eq. 6, the m-th cluster (i.e., Xj,i) size nm must range from mI to MI, yielding i + 1 − MI ≤ j ≤ i + 1 − mI. Furthermore, to 22(a) Vanila  (b) PCgrad - Timestep (c) PCgrad - SNR (d) PCgrad - Gradient (e) Nash - Uniform (f) Nash - SNR (g) Nash - Gradient (h) UW - Timestep (i) UW - SNR (j) UW - Gradient Figure 11: Qualitative comparison of ADM trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset.

Finally, Eq. 6 with constraints on the size of the cluster is derived as follows: D[i, m] = min max{1+(m−1)mI,i+1−MI}≤j j≤i+1−mI \b D[j −1, m−1]+ Lcluster(Xj,i) \t , 1 ≤ i ≤ T, 1 ≤ m ≤ k. (7) Specifically, we assign ⌊ T 2k ⌋ and ⌈3T 2k ⌉ to mI and MI, respectively. H Broader Impacts Revisiting Diffusion Models through Multi-Task Learning Our work revisits diffusion model training from a Multi-Task Learning aspect. We show that negative transfer still occurs in diffusion models and addressing it with MTL methods can improve the diffusion models. Starting from our work, a better understanding of the multi-task learning characteristics in diffusion models can lead to further advancements in diffusion models. Negative Societal Impacts Generative models, including diffusion models, have the potential to impact privacy in various ways. For instance, in the context of DeepFake applications, where generative models are used to create realistic synthetic media, the training data plays a critical role in shaping the model’s behavior. When the training data is biased or contains problematic content, the generative model can inherit these biases and potentially generate harmful or misleading outputs. This highlights the importance 23Figure 13: Randomly selected images from generated images of LDM with combined methods of UW, PCgrad, and P2 on the FFHQ dataset. DDIM 250-step sampler is used. of carefully selecting and curating the training data for generative models, particularly when privacy and ethical considerations are at stake. I Limitations Our work has two limitations that can be regarded as future works. Firstly, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of negative transfer in the training of diffusion models as shown in Fig. 5. This indicates that learning entire denoising tasks still causes degradation in certain denoising tasks. By successfully addressing this degradation and enabling the model to harmoniously learn entire denoising tasks, we anticipate significant improvements in the performance of the diffusion model. Secondly, our study does not delve into the architectural design aspects of multi-task learning methods. While our focus lies on model-agnostic approaches in MTL, it is worthwhile to explore the possibilities of designing appropriate architectures within an MTL framework. Previous works in diffusion models utilize timestep and noise level as input, which can be considered as using task embeddings scheme [73]. By revisiting these aspects, the architecture of the diffusion model can be further advanced in future works. 24",

However, the best way to harness the perceptual knowledge of these generative models for visual tasks is still an open question. Specifically, it is unclear how to use the prompting interface when applying diffusion back- bones to vision tasks. We find that automatically gener- ated captions can improve text-image alignment and sig- nificantly enhance a model’s cross-attention maps, lead- ing to better perceptual performance. Our approach im- proves upon the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in diffusion- based semantic segmentation on ADE20K and the cur- rent overall SOTA for depth estimation on NYUv2. Fur- thermore, our method generalizes to the cross-domain set- ting. We use model personalization and caption mod- ifications to align our model to the target domain and find improvements over unaligned baselines. Our cross- domain object detection model, trained on Pascal VOC, achieves SOTA results on Watercolor2K. Our cross-domain segmentation method, trained on Cityscapes, achieves SOTA results on Dark Zurich-val and Nighttime Driving.

Recently, a few works have shown diffusion pre-trained backbones have a strong prior for scene understanding that allows them to perform well in advanced discriminative vision tasks, such as se- mantic segmentation [17, 53], monocular depth estimation [53], and keypoint estimation [28, 43]. We refer to these works as diffusion-based perception methods. Unlike con- trastive vision language models (e.g., CLIP) [22, 26, 31], *Equal contribution. “a dog and a bird” ”in a watercolor style” Captioner Caption Modifier + Single-domain Cross-domain Depth Estimation Segmentation Object Detection Diffusion-Pretrained Vision Model CLIP Figure 1. Text-Aligned Diffusion Perception (TADP). In TADP, image captions align the text prompts and images passed to diffusion-based vision models. In cross-domain tasks, target do- main information is incorporated into the prompt to boost perfor- mance. generative models have a causal relationship with text, in which text guides image generation. In latent diffusion models, text prompts control the denoising U-Net [36], moving the image latent in a semantically meaningful di- rection [5]. We explore this relationship and find that text-image alignment significantly improves the performance of diffusion-based perception. We then investigate text-target domain alignment in cross-domain vision tasks, finding that aligning to the target domain while training on the source domain can improve a model’s target domain performance (Fig. 1). We first study prompting for diffusion-based perceptual models and find that increasing text-image alignment im- proves semantic segmentation and depth estimation perfor- 1 arXiv:2310.00031v3  [cs.CV]  1 Apr 2024mance. We find that unaligned text prompts can introduce semantic shifts to the feature maps of the diffusion model [5] and that these shifts can make it more difficult for the task-specific head to solve the target task. Specifically, we ask whether unaligned text prompts, such as averag- ing class-specific sentence embeddings ([31, 53]), hinder performance by interfering with feature maps through the cross-attention mechanism. Through ablation experiments on Pascal VOC2012 segmentation [14] and ADE20K [55], we find that off-target and missing class names degrade im- age segmentation quality. We show automated image cap- tioning [25] achieves sufficient text-image alignment for perception. Our approach (along with latent representation scaling, see Sec. 4.1) improves performance for semantic segmentation on Pascal and ADE20k by 4.0 mIoU and 1.7 mIoU, respectively, and depth estimation on NYUv2 [42] by 0.2 RMSE (+8% relative) setting the new SOTA. Next, we focus on cross-domain adaptation: can ap- propriate image captioning help visual perception when the model is trained in one domain and tested on a dif- ferent domain? Training models on the source domain with the appropriate prompting strategy leads to excellent unsupervised cross-domain performance on several bench- marks. We evaluate our cross-domain method on Pascal VOC [13, 14] to Watercolor2k (W2K) and Comic2k (C2K) [21] for object detection and Cityscapes (CS) [9] to Dark Zurich (DZ) [39] and Nighttime (ND) Driving [10] for se- mantic segmentation. We explore varying degrees of text- target domain alignment and find that improved alignment results in better performance. We also demonstrate using two diffusion personalization methods, Textual Inversion [16] and DreamBooth [37], for better target domain align- ment and performance. We find that diffusion pre-training is sufficient to achieve SOTA (+5.8 mIoU on CS→DZ, +4.0 mIoU on CS →ND, +0.7 mIoU on VOC →W2k) or near SOTA results on all cross-domain datasets with no text- target domain alignment, and including our best text-target domain alignment method further improves +1.4 AP on Wa- tercolor2k, +2.1 AP on Comic2k, and +3.3 mIoU on Night- time Driving. Overall, our contributions are as follows: • We propose a new method using automated caption generation that significantly improves performance on several diffusion-based vision tasks through increased text-image alignment. • We systematically study how prompting affects diffusion-based vision performance, elucidating the impact of class presence, grammar in the prompt, and previously used average embeddings. • We demonstrate that diffusion-based perception effec- tively generalizes across domains, with text-target do- main alignment improving performance, which can be further boosted by model personalization. 2. Related Work 2.1. Diffusion models for single-domain vision tasks Diffusion models are trained to reverse a step-wise forward noising process. Once trained, they can generate highly re- alistic images from pure noise [32, 35, 38, 52]. To con- trol image generation, diffusion models are trained with text prompts/captions that guide the diffusion process. These prompts are passed through a text encoder to generate text embeddings that are incorporated into the reverse diffusion process via cross-attention layers. Recently, some works have explored using diffusion models for discriminative vision tasks. This can be done by either utilizing the diffusion model as a backbone for the task [17, 28, 43, 53] or through fine-tuning the diffu- sion model for a specific task and then using it to generate synthetic data for a downstream model [2, 50]. We use the diffusion model as a backbone for downstream vision tasks. VPD [53] encodes images into latent representations and passes them through one step of the Stable Diffusion model. The cross-attention maps, multi-scale features, and output latent code are concatenated and passed to a task-specific head. Text prompts influence all these maps through the cross-attention mechanism, which guides the reverse dif- fusion process. The cross-attention maps are incorporated into the multi-scale feature maps and the output latent rep- resentation. The text guides the diffusion process and can accordingly shift the latent representation in semantic di- rections [1, 5, 16, 18]. The details of how VPD uses the prompting interface are described in Sec. 3. In short, VPD uses unaligned text prompts. In our work, we show how aligning the text to the image by using a captioner can sig- nificantly improve semantic segmentation and depth esti- mation performance. 2.2. Image captioning CLIP [31] introduced a novel learning paradigm to align images with their captions. Shortly after, the LAION-5B dataset [41] was released with 5B image-text pairs; this dataset was used to train Stable Diffusion. We hypothe- size that text-image alignment is important for diffusion- pretrained vision models. However, images used in ad- vanced vision tasks (like segmentation and depth estima- tion) are not naturally paired with text captions. To obtain image-aligned captions, we use BLIP-2 [25], a model that inverts the CLIP latent space to generate captions for novel images. 2.3. Diffusion models for cross-domain vision tasks A few works explore the cross-domain setting with diffu- sion models [2, 17]. Benigmim et al. [2] use a diffusion model to generate data for a downstream unsupervised do- main adaptation (UDA) architecture. In [17], the diffusion 2backbone is frozen, and the segmentation head is trained with a consistency loss with category and scene prompts guiding the latent code towards target cross-domains. Sim- ilar to VPD, the category prompts consist of token embed- dings for all classes present in the dataset, irrespective of their presence in any specific image. The consistency loss forces the model to predict the same output mask for all the different scene prompts, helping the segmentation head be- come invariant to the scene type. Instead of using a consis- tency loss, we train the diffusion model backbone and task head on the source domain data with and without incorpo- rating the style of the target domain in the caption. We find that better alignment with the target domain (i.e., target do- main information included in the prompt) results in better cross-domain performance. 2.4. Cross-domain object detection Cross-domain object detection can be divided into multi- ple subcategories, depending on what data / labels are at train / test time available. Unsupervised domain adaptation objection detection (UDAOD) tries to improve detection performance by training on unlabeled target domain data with approaches such as self-training [11, 44], adversarial distribution alignment [54] or generating pseudo labels for self-training [23]. Cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CDWSOD) assumes the availability of image- level annotations at training time and utilizes pseudo label- ing [21, 30], alignment [51] or correspondence mining [19]. Recently, [46] used CLIP [31] for Single Domain General- ization, which aims to generalize from a single domain to multiple unseen target domains. Our text-based method de- fines a new category of cross-domain object detection that tries to adapt from a single source to an unseen target do- main by only having the broad semantic context of the target domain (e.g., foggy/night/comic/watercolor) as text input to our method. When we incorporate model personalization, our method can be considered a UDAOD method since we train a token based on unlabeled images from the target do- main. 3. Methods Stable Diffusion [35]. The text-to-image Stable Diffusion model is composed of four networks: an encoderE, a condi- tional denoising autoencoder (a U-Net in Stable Diffusion) ϵθ, a language encoder τθ (the CLIP text encoder in Stable Diffusion), and a decoder D. E and D are trained before ϵθ, such that D(E(x)) = ˜x ≈ x. Training ϵθ is composed of a pre-defined forward process and a learned reverse pro- cess. The reverse process is learned using LAION-400M [40], a dataset of 400 million images (x ∈ X) and captions (y ∈ Y ). In the forward process, an image x is encoded into a latent z0 = E(x), and t steps of a forward noise pro- cess are executed to generate a noised latent zt. Then, to learn the reverse process, the latent zt is passed to the de- noising autoencoder ϵθ, along with the time-step t and the image caption’s representation C = τθ(y). τθ adds infor- mation about y to ϵθ using a cross-attention mechanism, in which the query is derived from the image, and the key and value are transformations of the caption representation. The model ϵθ is trained to predict the noise added to the latent in step t of the forward process: LLDM := EE(x),y,ϵ∼N(0,1),t h ∥ϵ−ϵθ(zt, t, τθ(y))∥2 2 i , (1) where t ∈ {0, ..., T}. During generation, a pure noise la- tent zT and a user-specified prompt are passed through the denoising autoencoder ϵθ for T steps and decoded D(z0) to generate an image guided by the text prompt. Diffusion for Feature Extraction. Diffusion backbones have been used for downstream vision tasks in several re- cent works [17, 28, 43, 53]. Due to its public availabil- ity and performance in perception tasks, we use a modi- fied version (see Sec. 4.1) of the feature extraction method in VPD. An image latent z0 = E(x) and a conditioning C are passed through the last step of the denoising process ϵθ(z0, 0, C). The cross-attention maps A and the multi-scale feature maps F of the U-Net are concatenated V = A ⊕ F and passed to a task-specific head H to generate a predic- tion ˆp = H(V ). The backbone ϵθ and head H are trained with a task-specific loss LH(ˆp, p). Average EOS Tokens. To generate C, previous meth- ods [17, 53] rely on a method from CLIP [31] to use aver- aged text embeddings as representations for the classes in a dataset. A list of 80 sentence templates for each class of in- terest (such as “a <adjective> photo of a <class name>”) are passed through the CLIP text encoder. We use B to de- note the set of class names in a dataset. For a specific class (b ∈ B), the CLIP text encoder returns an 80 × N × D tensor, where N is the maximum number of tokens over all the templates, and D is 768 (the dimension of each token embedding). Shorter sentences are padded with EOS to- kens to fill out the maximum number of tokens. The first EOS token from each sentence template is averaged and used as the representative embedding for the class such that C ∈ R|B|×768. This method is used in [17, 53], we denote it as Cavg and use it as a baseline. For semantic segmen- tation, all of the class embeddings, irrespective of presence in the image, are passed to the cross-attention layers. Only the class embedding of the room type is passed to the cross- attention layers for depth estimation. 3.1. Text-Aligned Diffusion Perception (TADP) Our work proposes a novel method for prompting diffusion- pretrained perception models. Specifically, we explore dif- ferent prompting methods G to generate C. In the single- domain setting, we show the effectiveness of a method 3Denoising U-Net Depth  Estimation Domain adaptation Text-image alignment  Text-domain alignment Multi-scale Feature Maps EOS class token [dog, bird, car, airplane, ...] BLIP “a photo of a dog and a parrot” Oracle “dog bird” Textual Inversion / DreamBooth “in a <token> style” simple “in a watercolor style” null “ ” Cross-attention CLIP Prompt Image  Encoder Task- speciﬁc Decoder Semantic Segmentation Object Detection LS Figure 2. Overview of TADP.We test several prompting strategies and evaluate their impact on downstream vision task performance. Our method concatenates the cross-attention and multi-scale feature maps before passing them to the vision-specific decoder. In the blue box, we show three single-domain captioning strategies with differing levels of text-image alignment. We propose using BLIP [25] captioning to improve image-text alignment. We extend our analysis to the cross-domain setting (yellow box), exploring whether aligning the source domain text captions to the target domain may impact model performance by appending caption modifiers to image captions generated in the source domain and find model personalization modifiers (Textual Inversion/Dreambooth) work best. that uses BLIP-2 [25], an image captioning algorithm, to generate a caption as the conditioning for the model: G(x) = ˜y → C. We then extend our method to the cross- domain setting by incorporating target domain information to C = C + M(P)s, where M is a caption modifier that takes target domain information P as input and outputs a caption modification M(P)s and a model modification M(P)ϵθ . In Sec. 4, we analyze the text-image interface of the diffusion model by varying the captioner G and cap- tion modifier M in a systematic manner for three differ- ent vision tasks: semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation. Our method and experi- ments are presented in Fig. 2. Following [53], we train our ADE20k segmentation and NYUv2 depth estimation mod- els with fast and regular schedules. On ADE20k, we train using 4k steps (fast), 8k steps (fast), and 80k steps (normal). For NYUv2 depth, we train on a 1-epoch (fast) schedule and a 25-epoch (normal) schedule. For implementation details, refer to Appendix D. 4. Results 4.1. Latent scaling Before exploring image-text alignment, we apply latent scaling to encoded images (Appendix G of Rombach et al. [35]). This normalizes the image latents to have a standard normal distribution. The scaling factor is fixed at 0.18215. We find that latent scaling improves performance usingCavg for segmentation and depth estimation (Fig. 3). Specifically, latent scaling improves ∼0.8% mIoU on Pascal, ∼0.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and a relative∼5.5% RMSE on NYUv2 Depth (Fig. 3).

We scrutinize the use of average EOS tokens for C (see Sec. 3). While average EOS tokens are sensible when measuring cosine similarities in the CLIP latent space, it is unsuitable in diffusion models, where the text guides the diffusion process through cross-attention. In our qualitative analysis, we find that average EOS tokens degrade the cross-attention maps (Fig. 4). Instead, we ex- plore using CLIP to embed each class name independently and use the tokens corresponding to the actual word (not the EOS token) and pass this as input to the cross-attention layer: GClassEmbs(B) =concat(CLIP(b)|b ∈ B) → CClassEmbs (2) 4no LS w/LS80.0 82.5 85.0 Pascal VOC2012  mIoU % ( ) no LS w/LS50.0 52.5 55.0 ADE20K  mIoU % ( ) no LS w/LS0.20 0.25 0.30 NYUv2  RMSE ( ) 0 20 4086 87 88 0 20 40 BLIP min words 54.0 54.5 55.0 0 20 400.220 0.225 0.230 Figure 3. Effects of Latent Scaling (LS) and BLIP caption min- imum length. We report mIoU for Pascal, mIoU for ADE20K, and RMSE for NYUv2 depth (right). (Top) Latent scaling im- proves performance on Pascal ∼0.8 mIoU (higher is better), ∼0.3 mIoU, and ∼5.5% relative RMSE (lower is better). (Bottom) We see a similar effect for BLIP minimum token length, with longer captions performing better, improving ∼0.8 mIoU on Pas- cal, ∼0.9 mIoU on ADE20K, and ∼0.6% relative RMSE. Second, we explore a generic prompt, a string of class names separated by spaces: GClassNames(B) ={‘ ’ + b|b ∈ B} → CClassNames (3) These prompts are similar to the ones used for averaged EOS tokens Cavg w.r.t. overall text-image alignment but instead use the token corresponding to the word represent- ing the class name. We evaluate these variations on Pascal VOC2012 segmentation. We find that CClassNames improves performance by 1.0 mIoU, but CClassEmbs reduces perfor- mance by 0.3 mIoU (see Tab. 1). We perform more in-depth analyses of the effect of text-image alignment on the dif- fusion model’s cross-attention maps and image generation properties in Appendix A. TADP. To align the diffusion model text input to the im- age, we use BLIP-2 [25] to generate captions for every im- age in our single-domain datasets (Pascal, ADE20K, and NYUv2). GTADP(x) =BLIP-2(x) → CTADP(x) (4) BLIP-2 is trained to produce image-aligned text captions and is designed around the CLIP latent space. How- ever, other vision-language algorithms that produce cap- tions could also be used. We find that these text captions improve performance in all datasets and tasks (Tabs. 1, 2, 3). Performance improves on Pascal segmentation by ∼4% mIoU, ADE20K by ∼1.4% mIoU, and NYUv2 Depth by a relative RMSE improvement of 4%. We see stronger effects on the fast schedules for ADE20K with an improvement of ∼5 mIoU at (4k), ∼2.4 mIoU (8K). On NYUv2 Depth, we see a smaller gain on the fast schedule∼2.4%. All numbers are reported relative to VPD with latent scaling.

A minimum caption length of 40 tokens performs the best.We also explore adding a text-adapter (TA) to TADP, but find no significant gain. See Table 1 for a notation key. We perform some ablations to analyze what aspects of the captions are important. We explore the minimum token number hyperparameter for BLIP-2 to explore if longer cap- tions can produce more useful feature maps for the down- stream task. We try a minimum token number of 0, 20, and 40 tokens (denoted as CTADP-N) and find small but consis- tent gains with longer captions, resulting on average 0.75% relative gain for 40 tokens vs. 0 tokens (Fig. 3).

We compare the cross-attention maps for four types of prompting: oracle, BLIP, Average EOS tokens, and class names as space-separated strings. The cross-attention maps for different heads at all different scales are upsampled to 64x64 and averaged. When comparing Average Template EOS and Class Names, we see (qualitatively) averaging degrades the quality of the cross-attention maps. Furthermore, we find that class names that are not present in the image can have highly localized attention maps (e.g., ‘bottle’). Further analysis of the cross-attention maps is available in Sec. A, where we explore image-to-image generation, copy-paste image modifications, and more. caption is necessary for the performance gains we observe. We use NLTK [4] to filter for the nouns in the captions. In the CTADP(NO)-20 nouns-only caption setting, we achieve 86.4% mIoU, similar to 86.2% mIoU withCTADP-20 (Tab. 1), suggesting nouns are sufficient. Oracle. This insight about nouns leads us to ask if an oracle caption, in which all the object class names in an image are provided as a caption, can improve performance further. We define B(x) as the set of class names present in image x. GOracle(x) ={‘ ’ + b|b ∈ B(x)} → COracle(x) (5) While this is not a realistic setting, it serves as an approx- imate upper bound on performance for our method on the segmentation task. We find a large improvement in per- formance in segmentation, achieving 89% mIoU on Pascal and 72.2% mIoU on ADE20K. For depth estimation, multi- class segmentation masks are only provided for a smaller subset of the images, so we cannot generate a comparable oracle. We perform ablations on the oracle captions to eval- uate the model’s sensitivity to alignment. For ADE20K, on the 4k iteration schedule, we modify the oracle captions by randomly adding and removing classes such that the re- call and precision are at 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (independently) (Tab. S2). We find that both precision and recall have an effect, but recall is significantly more important. When re- call is lower (0.50), improving precision has minimal im- pact ( <1% mIoU). However, precision has progressively larger impacts as recall increases to 0.75 and 1.00 ( ∼3% mIoU and ∼7% mIoU). In contrast, recall has large impacts at every precision level: 0.5 - ( ∼6% mIoU), 0.75 - ( ∼9% mIoU), and 1.00 - ( ∼13% mIoU). BLIP-2 captioning per- forms similarly to a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.5 (Tab. 2). Additional analyses w.r.t. precision, recall, and object sizes can be found in Appendix B. 4.3. Cross-domain alignment Next, we ask if text-image alignment can benefit cross- domain tasks. In cross-domain, we train a model on a source domain and test it on a different target domain. There are two aspects of alignment in the cross-domain setting: the first is also present in single-domain, which is image- text alignment; the second is unique to the cross-domain setting, which is text-target domain alignment.

Our method sets a new SOTA for DarkZurich and Nighttime Driving. is challenging because there is a large domain shift between the source and target domain. Our intuition is that while the model has no information on the target domain from the training images, an appropriate text prompt may carry some general information about the target domain. Our cross- domain experiments focus on the text-target domain align- ment and useGTADP for image-text alignment (following our insights from the single-domain setting). Training. Our experiments in this setting are designed in the following manner: we train a diffusion model on the source domain captions CTADP(x). With these source domain captions, we experiment with four different cap- tion modifications (each increasing in alignment to the tar- get domain), a null Mnull(P) caption modification where Mnull(P)s = ∅ = Mnull(P)ϵθ = ∅, a simple Msimple(P) caption modifier whereMsimple(P)s is a hand-crafted string describing the style of the target domain appended to the end and Msimple(P)ϵθ = ∅, a Textual Inversion [16] MTI(P) caption modifier where the output MTI(P)s is a learned Textual Inversion token <*> and MTI(P)ϵθ = ∅, and a DreamBooth [37] MDB(P) caption modifier where MDB(P)s is a learned DreamBooth token <SKS> and MDB(P)ϵθ is a DreamBoothed diffusion backbone. We also include two additional control experiments. In the first, Mud(P) an unrelated target domain style is appended to the end of the string. In the second, Mnd(P) a nearby but a different target domain style is appended to the caption. MTI(P) and MDB(P) require more information than the other methods, such thatP represents a subset of unlabelled images from the target domain. Testing. When testing the trained models on the tar- get domain images, we want to use the same caption- ing modification for the test images as in the training setup.

For example, GTADP(x) might produce the caption “a watercolor paint- ing of a dog and a bird” for an image from the Water- color2K dataset. Using the Msimple(P) captioning modi- fication on this prompt would introduce redundant informa- tion and would not match the caption format used during training. In order to remove target domain information and get a plain caption that can be modified in the same man- ner as in the training data, we use GPT-3.5 [6] to remove all mentions of the target domain shift. For example, after using GPT-3.5 to remove mentions of the watercolor style in the above sentence, we are left with “an image of a bird and a dog”. With these GPT-3.5 cleaned captions, we can match the caption modifications used during training when evaluating test images. This caption-cleaning strategy lets us control how target domain information is included in the test image captions, ensuring that test captions are in the same domain as train captions. Evaluation. We evaluate cross-domain transfer on sev- eral datasets. We train our model on Pascal VOC [13, 14] object detection and evaluate on Watercolor2K (W2K) [21] and Comic2K (C2K) [21]. We also train our model on the Cityscapes [9] dataset and evaluate on the Nighttime Driv- ing (ND) [10] and Dark Zurich-val (DZ-val) [39] datasets. We show results in Tabs. 4, 5. In the following sections, we also report the average performance of each method on the cross-domain segmentation datasets (average mIoU) and the cross-domain object detection datasets (average AP). 7Null caption modifier. The null captions have no tar- get domain information. In this setting, the model is trained with captions with no target domain information and tested with GPT-3.5 cleaned target domain captions. We find diffusion pre-training to be extraordinarily powerful on its own, with just plain captions (no target domain informa- tion); the model already achieves SOTA on VOC →W2K with 72.1 AP50, SOTA on CD →DZ-val with 42.8 mIoU and SOTA on CD →ND with 60.8 mIoU. Our model per- forms better than the current SOTA [44] on VOC →W2K and worse on VOC→C2K (highlighted in yellow in Tab. 5). However, [44] uses a large extra training dataset from the target (comic) domain, so we highlight in bold our results in Tab. 5 to show they outperform all other methods that use only images in C2K as examples from the target do- main. Furthermore, these results are with a lightweight FPN [24] head, in contrast to other competitive methods like Re- fign [7], which uses a heavier decoder head. These captions achieve 50.5 average mIoU and 36.6 average AP. Simple caption modifier. We then add target domain in- formation to our captions by prepending the target domain’s semantic shift to the generic captions. These caption modi- fiers are hand-crafted. For example, “a dog and a bird” be- comes “a X style painting of a dog and a bird” (where X is watercolor for W2K and comic for C2K) and “a dark night photo of a dog and a bird” for DZ. These captions achieve 48.0 average mIoU and 37.7 average AP. Textual Inversion caption modifier. Textual inversion [16] is a method that learns a target concept (an object or style) from a set of images and encodes it into a new to- ken. We learn a novel token from target domain image sam- ples to further increase image-text alignment (for details, see Sec. D.1). In this setting, the sentence template be- comes “a <token> style painting of a dog and a bird”. We find that, on average, Textual Inversion captions perform the best, achieving 51.1 average mIoU and 38.2 average AP. DreamBooth caption modifier. DreamBooth-ing [37] aims to achieve the same goal as textual inversion. Along with learning a new token, the stable-diffusion backbone it- self is fine-tuned with a set of target domain images (for de- tails, see Sec. D.1). We swap the stable diffusion backbone with the DreamBooth-ed backbone before training. We use the same template as in textual inversion. These captions achieve 49.7 average mIoU and 38.1 average AP. Ablations. We ablate our target domain alignment strat- egy by introducing unrelated and nearby target-domain style modifications. For example, this would be “a dash- cam photo of a dog and a bird” (unrelated) and “aconstruc- tivism painting of a dog and a bird” (nearby) for the W2K and C2K datasets. “A watercolor painting of a car on the street” (unrelated) and “a foggy photo of a car on the street” for the ND and DZ-val datasets. We find these off-target domains reduce performance on all datasets. 5. Discussion We present a method for image-text alignment that is gen- eral, fully automated, and can be applied to any diffusion- based perception model. To achieve this, we systematically explore the impact of text-image alignment on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection. We investigate whether similar principles apply in the cross- domain setting and find that alignment towards the target domain during training improves downstream cross-domain performance. We find that EOS token averaging for prompting does not work as effectively as strings for the objects in the im- age. Our oracle ablation experiments show that our diffu- sion pre-trained segmentation model is particularly sensi- tive to missing classes (reduced recall) and less sensitive to off-target classes (reduced precision), and both have a neg- ative impact. Our results show that aligning text prompts to the image is important in identifying/generating good multi- scale feature maps for the downstream segmentation head. This implies that the multi-scale features and latent repre- sentations do not naturally identify semantic concepts with- out the guidance of the text in diffusion models. Moreover, proper latent scaling is crucial for downstream vision tasks. Lastly, we show how using a captioner, which has the ben- efit of being open vocabulary, high precision, and down- stream task agnostic, to prompt the diffusion pre-trained segmentation model automatically improves performance significantly over providing all possible class names. We also find that diffusion models can be used effec- tively for cross-domain tasks. Our model, without any captions, already surpasses several SOTA results in cross- domain tasks due to the diffusion backbone’s generaliz- ability. We find that good target domain alignment can help with cross-domain performance for some domains, and misalignment leads to worse performance. Capturing in- formation about target domain styles in words alone can be difficult. For these cases, we show that model per- sonalization through Textual Inversion or Dreambooth can bridge the gap without requiring labeled data. Future work could explore how to expand our framework to generalize to multiple unseen domains. Future work may also explore closed vocabulary captioners that are more task-specific to get closer to oracle-level performance. Acknowledgements.

Cross-attention analysis Qualitative image-to-image variation analysis. We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the effect of off-target class names added to the prompt. In Fig. S1, we use the stable diffusion image to image (img2img) variation pipeline (with the original Stable Diffusion 1.5 weights) to qualitatively analyze the effects of prompts with off-target classes. The img2img variation pipeline encodes a real image into a latent representation, adds a user-specified amount of noise to the latent representation, and de-noises it (according to a user-specified prompt) to generate a variation on the original image. The amount of noise added is dictated by a strength ratio indicating how much variation should occur. A higher ratio results in more added noise and more denoising steps, allowing a relatively higher impact of the new text prompt on the image. We find that CClassNames (see caption for details) results in variations that incorporate the off-target classes. This effect is most clear looking across the panels left to right in which objects belonging to off-target classes (an airplane and a train) become more prominent. These qualitative results imply that this prompt modifies the latent representation to incorporate information about off-target classes, potentially making the downstream task more difficult. In contrast, using the BLIP prompt changes the image, but the semantics (position of objects, classes present) of the image variation are significantly closer to the original. These results suggest a mechanism for how off-target classes may impact our vision models. We quantitatively measure this effect using a fully trained Oracle model in the following section. Copy-Paste Experiment. An interesting property in Fig. 4 is that the word bottle has strong cross-attention over the neck of the bird. We hypothesize that diffusion models seek to find the nearest match for each token since they are trained to generate images that correspond to the prompt. We test this hypothesis on a base image of a dog and a bird. We first visualize the cross-attention maps for a set of object labels. We find that the words bottle, cat, and horse have a strong cross-attention to the bird, dog, and dog, respectively. We paste a bottle, cat, and horse into the base image to see if the diffusion model will localize the “correct” objects if they are present. In Fig. S2, we show that the cross-attention maps prefer to localize the “correct” object, suggesting our hypothesis is correct. Averaged EOS Tokens: Averaging vs. EOS? Averaged EOS Tokens create diffuse attention maps that empirically harm performance. What is the actual cause of the decrease in performance? Is it averaging, or is it the usage of many EOS tokens? We replace the averaged EOS tokens with single prompt EOS tokens and find that the attention maps are still diffuse. This indicates that the usage of EOS tokens is the primary cause of the diffuse attention maps and not the averaging. Quantitative effect of CClassNames on Oracle model. To quantify the impact of the off-target classes on the downstream vision task, we measure the averaged pixel-wise scores (normalized via Softmax) per class when passing the CClassNames to the Oracle segmentation model for Pascal VOC 2012 (Fig. S4). We compare this to the original oracle prompt. We find that including the off-target prompts significantly increases the probability of a pixel being misclassified as one of the semantically nearby off-target classes. For example, if the original image contains a cow, including the words dog and sheep, it significantly raises the probability of misclassifying the pixels belonging to the cow as pixels belonging to a dog or a sheep. These results indicate that the task-specific head picks up the effect of off-target classes and is incorporated into the output. 15 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Class   Names BLIP De-noising steps Figure S1.

Averaging vs. EOS. In [53], for each class name, the EOS token from 80 prompts (containing the class name) was averaged together. The averaged EOS tokens for each class were concatenated together and passed to the diffusion model as text input. We explore if averaging drives the diffuse nature of the cross-attention maps. We replace the 80 prompt templates with a single prompt template: “a photo of a {class name}” and visualize the cross-attention maps. In the top row, we show the averaged template EOS tokens. In the bottom row, we show the single template EOS tokens. airplanebicycle birdboatbottle buscar catchaircow dining table doghorse motorcycle person potted plant sheepsofatrain television Activation airplane bicycle bird boat bottle bus car cat chair cow dining table dog horse motorcycle person potted plant sheep sofa train television T arget 0.93 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.76 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.87 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.88 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.94 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.94 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.75 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.90 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.80 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.90 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.90 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.88 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.89 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.70 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.80 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.91 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.80 airplanebicycle birdboatbottle buscar catchaircow dining table doghorse motorcycle person potted plant sheepsofatrain television Activation airplane bicycle bird boat bottle bus car cat chair cow dining table dog horse motorcycle person potted plant sheep sofa train television T arget 0.85 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.61 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.40 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.01 0.15 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.10 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.06 0.03 0.02 0.49 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.07 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.72 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.65 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.68 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.17 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.59 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.64 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.03 0.22 0.02 0.17 0.21 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.65 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.79 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.09 0.01 0.08 0.53 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.04 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.62 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.86 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.05 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.42 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.03 0.15 0.02 0.21 0.09 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.22 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.16 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.51 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.07 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.65 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.76 Figure S4.

Implementation Details To isolate the effects of our text-image alignment method, we ensure our model setup precisely follows prior work. Following VPD [53], we jointly train the task-specific head and the diffusion backbone. The learning rate of the backbone is set to 1/10 the learning rate of the head to preserve the benefits of pre-training better. We describe the different tasks by describing H and LH. We use an FPN [24] head with a cross-entropy loss for segmentation. We use the same convolutional head used in VPD for monocular depth estimation with a Scale-Invariant loss [12]. For object detection, we use a Faster-RCNN head with the standard Faster-RCNN loss [34] 1. Further details of the training setup can be found in Tab. S3 and Tab. S4. In our single-domain tables, we include our reproduction of VPD, denoted with a (R). We compute our relative gains with our reproduced numbers, with the same seed for all experiments.

      "title": "DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models for Adversarial Robustness",
      "abstract": "Diffusion models have been recently employed to improve certified robustness\nthrough the process of denoising. However, the theoretical understanding of why\ndiffusion models are able to improve the certified robustness is still lacking,\npreventing from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by\nanalyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the\nconditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper\nunderstanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve\nthe certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an\n(adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the\nreverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get\nmultiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier,\nfollowed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction.\nThis design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical\nanalysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically,\nwhen the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under\nthe reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the\nlatter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return\nthe corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest\ndensity point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we\nidentify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's\nreverse process.

However, the theoretical understanding of why diffusion models are able to improve the certiﬁed robustness is still lacking, pre- venting from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by analyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the conditions under which they can enhance certiﬁed robustness. This deeper understanding al- lows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve the certiﬁed robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classiﬁer). Given an (adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the reverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get multiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classiﬁer, followed by majority voting of in- ferred labels to make the ﬁnal prediction. This design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical analysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Speciﬁcally, when the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under the reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the latter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return the corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sam- ple, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model’s reverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex sets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identiﬁed in previous works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certiﬁed robustness. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness ofDensePure by evaluat- ing its certiﬁed robustness given a standard model via randomized smoothing. We show that DensePure is consistently better than existing methods on ImageNet, with 7% improvement on average. 1 I NTRODUCTION Diffusion models have been shown to be a powerful image generation tool (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021b) owing to their iterative diffusion and denoising processes. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on sample quality (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Vahdat et al., 2021) as well as effective mode coverage (Song et al., 2021a). A diffusion model usually consists of two processes: (i) a forward diffusion process that converts data to noise by gradually adding noise to the input, and (ii) a reverse generative process that starts from noise and generates data by denoising one step at a time (Song et al., 2021b). Given the natural denoising property of diffusion models, empirical studies have leveraged them to perform adversarial puriﬁcation (Nie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Carlini et al., 2022). For instance, Nie et al. (2022) introduce a diffusion model based puriﬁcation model DiffPure. They empirically show that by carefully choosing the amount of Gaussian noises added during the diffusion process, adversarial perturbations can be removed while preserving the true label semantics. Despite the signiﬁcant empirical results, there is no provable guarantee of the achieved robustness. Carlini et al. ∗the ﬁrst four authors contributed equally 1 arXiv:2211.00322v1  [cs.LG]  1 Nov 2022DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness (2022) instantiate the randomized smoothing approach with the diffusion model to offer a provable guarantee of model robustness against L2-norm bounded adversarial example. However, they do not provide a theoretical understanding of why and how the diffusion models contribute to such nontrivial certiﬁed robustness. Our Approach. We theoretically analyze the fundamental properties of diffusion models to under- stand why and how it enhances certiﬁed robustness. This deeper understanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure to improve the certiﬁed robustness of any given classiﬁer by more effec- tively using the diffusion model. An illustration of theDensePure framework is provided in Figure 1, where it consists of a pretrained diffusion model and a pretrained classiﬁer. DensePure in- corporates two steps: (i) using the reverse process of the diffusion model to obtain a sample of the posterior data distribution conditioned on the adversarial input; and (ii) repeating the reverse process multiple times with different random seeds to approximate the label of high density region in the conditional distribution via a majority vote. In particular, given an adversarial input, we repeatedly feed it into the reverse process of the diffusion model to get multiple reversed examples and feed them into the classiﬁer to get their labels. We then apply the majority vote on the set of labels to get the ﬁnal predicted label. DensePure is inspired by our theoretical analysis, where we show that the diffusion model reverse process provides a conditional distribution of the reversed sample given an adversarial input, and sampling from this conditional distribution enhances the certiﬁed robustness. Speciﬁcally, we prove that when the data density of clean samples is high, it is a sufﬁcient condition for the conditional density of the reversed samples to be also high. Therefore, in DensePure, samples from the condi- tional distribution can recover the ground-truth labels with a high probability. For the convenience of understanding and rigorous analysis, we use the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the deterministic reversed sample for the classiﬁer prediction. We show that the robust region for a given sample under the diffusion model’s reverse process is the union of multiple convex sets, each surrounding a region around the ground-truth label. Compared with the robust region of previous work (Cohen et al., 2019), which only focuses on the neighborhood ofone region with the ground-truth label, such union of multiple convex sets has the potential to provide a much larger robust region. Moreover, the characterization implies that the size of robust regions is affected by the relative density and the distance between data regions with the ground-truth label and those with other labels. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets under different settings to evaluate the certiﬁable robustness of DensePure. In particular, we follow the setting from Carlini et al. (2022) and rely on randomized smoothing to certify robustness to adversarial perturbations bounded in the L2-norm. We show that DensePure achieves the new state-of-the-art certiﬁed robustness on the clean model without tuning any model parameters (off-the-shelf). On ImageNet, it achieves a consistently higher certiﬁed accuracy than the existing methods among everyσat every radius ϵ, 7% improvement on average. Figure 1: Pipeline of DensePure. Technical Contributions. In this paper, we take the ﬁrst step towards understanding the sufﬁcient conditions of adversarial puriﬁcation with diffusion models. We make contributions on both theo- retical and empirical fronts: (1) We prove that under constrained data density property, an adversarial example can be recovered back to the original clean sample with high probability via the reverse pro- cess of a diffusion model. (2) In theory, we characterized the robust region for each point by further taking the highest density point in the conditional distribution generated by the reverse process as the reversed sample. (3) In practice, we proposed DensePure, which is a state-of-art adversarial puriﬁcation pipeline directly leveraging the reverse process of a pre-trained diffusion model and la- 2DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness bel majority vote. (4) We demonstrated comparable performance of DensePure on CIFAR-10 and state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet. 2 P RELIMINARIES AND BACKGROUNDS Continuous-Time Diffusion Model. The diffusion model has two components: the diffusion pro- cess followed by the reverse process. Given an input random variable x0 ∼p, the diffusion pro- cess adds isotropic Gaussian noises to the data so that the diffused random variable at time t is xt = √αt(x0 + ϵt), s.t., ϵt ∼N(0,σ2 tI), and σ2 t = (1 −αt)/αt, and we denote xt ∼pt. The forward diffusion process can also be deﬁned by the stochastic differential equation dx= h(x,t)dt+ g(t)dw, (SDE) where x0 ∼p, h : Rd ×R ↦→Rd is the drift coefﬁcient, g : R ↦→R is the diffusion coefﬁcient, and w(t) ∈Rn is the standard Wiener process. Under mild conditions B.1, the reverse process exists and removes the added noise by solving the reverse-time SDE (Anderson, 1982) dˆx= [h(ˆx,t) −g(t)2▽ˆxlog pt(ˆx)]dt+ g(t)dw, (reverse-SDE) where dtis an inﬁnitesimal reverse time step, and w(t) is a reverse-time standard Wiener process. In our context, we use the conventions of VP-SDE (Song et al., 2021b) where h(x; t) := −1 2 γ(t)x and g(t) := √ γ(t) with γ(t) positive and continuous over [0,1], such that x(t) = √αtx(0) +√1 −αtϵwhere αt = e− ∫ t 0 γ(s)ds and ϵ∼N(0,I). We use {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] to denote the diffusion process and the reverse process generated by SDE and reverse-SDE respectively, which follow the same distribution. Discrete-Time Diffusion Model (or DDPM (Ho et al., 2020)). DDPM constructs a discrete Markov chain {x0,x1,··· ,xi,··· ,xN}as the forward process for the training data x0 ∼p, such that P(xi|xi−1) = N(xi; √1 −βixi−1,βiI), where 0 <β1 <β2 <··· <βN <1 are predeﬁned noise scales such that xN approximates the Gaussian white noise. Denote αi = ∏N i=1(1 −βi), we have P(xi|x0) = N(xi; √αix0,(1 −αi)I), i.e., xt(x0,ϵ) = √αix0 + (1 −αi)ϵ,ϵ∼N(0,I). The reverse process of DDPM learns a reverse direction variational Markov chain pθ(xi−1|xi) = N(xi−1; µθ(xi,i),Σθ(xi,i)). Ho et al. (2020) deﬁnes ϵθ as a function approximator to predict ϵfrom xi such that µθ(xi,i) = 1√1−βi ( xi − βi√1−αi ϵθ(xi,i) ) . Then the reverse time samples are generated by ˆxi−1 = 1√1−βi ( ˆxi − βi√1−αi ϵθ∗(ˆxi,i) ) + √βiϵ,ϵ ∼N (000,I), and the optimal parameters θ∗are obtained by solving θ∗:= arg minθEx0,ϵ [ ||ϵ−ϵθ(√αix0 + (1 −αi),i)||2 2 ] . Randomized Smoothing. Randomized smoothing is used to certify the robustness of a given classiﬁer against L2-norm based perturbation. It transfers the classiﬁer f to a smooth version g(x) = arg maxcPϵ∼N(0,σ2I)(f(x+ ϵ) = c), where g is the smooth classiﬁer and σ is a hyper- parameter of the smooth classiﬁer g, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Cohen et al. (2019) shows that g(x) induces the certiﬁable robustness for xunder the L2-norm with radius R, where R = σ 2 ( Φ−1(pA) −Φ−1(pB) ) ; pA and pB are probability of the most probable class and “runner-up” class respectively;Φ is the inverse of the standard Gaussian CDF. ThepA and pB can be estimated with arbitrarily high conﬁdence via Monte Carlo method (Cohen et al., 2019). 3 T HEORETICAL ANALYSIS In this section, we theoretically analyze why and how the diffusion model can enhance the robustness of a given classiﬁer. We will analyze directly on SDE and reverse-SDE as they generate the same stochastic processes {xt}t∈[0,T] and the literature works establish an approximation on reverse- SDE (Song et al., 2021b; Ho et al., 2020). We ﬁrst show that given a diffusion model, solving reverse-SDE will generate a conditional distribu- tion based on the scaled adversarial sample, which will have high density on data region with high data density and near to the adversarial sample in Theorem 3.1. See detailed conditions in B.1. 3DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Theorem 3.1. Under conditions B.1, solving equation reverse-SDE starting from timetand sample xa,t = √αtxa will generate a reversed random variable ˆx0 with density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) ∝ p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)n exp ( −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t ) , where pis the data distribution, σ2 t = 1−αt αt is the variance of Gaussian noise added at time tin the diffusion process. Proof. (sketch) Under conditions B.1, we know {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] follow the same distri- bution, and then the rest proof follows Bayes’ Rule. Please see the full proofs of this and the following theorems in Appendix B.2. Remark 1. Note that P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) >0 if and only if p(x) >0, thus the generated reverse sample will be on the data region where we train classiﬁers. In Theorem 3.1, the conditional density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) is high only if both p(x) and the Gaussian term have high values, i.e., xhas high data density and is close to the adversarial sample xa. The latter condition is reasonable since adversarial perturbations are typically bounded due to budget constraints. Then, the above argument implies that a reversed sample will have the ground- truth label with a high probability if data region with the ground-truth label has high enough data density. For the convenience of theoretical analysis and understanding, we take the point with high- est conditional density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) as the reversed sample, deﬁned as P(xa; t) := arg maxxP(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t). P(xa; t) is a representative of the high density data region in the conditional distribution and P(·; t) is a deterministic puriﬁcation model. In the following, we characterize the robust region for data region with ground-truth label under P(·; t). The robust re- gion and the robust radius for a general deterministic puriﬁcation model given a classiﬁer are deﬁned below. Deﬁnition 3.2 (Robust Region and Robust Radius) . Given a classiﬁer f and a point x0, let G(x0) := {x : f(x) = f(x0)}be the data region where samples have the same label as x0. Then given a deterministic puriﬁcation model P(·; ψ) with parameter ψ, we deﬁne the robust re- gion of G(x0) under Pand f as Df P(G(x0); ψ) := {x: f(P(x; ψ)) = f(x0)}, i.e., the set of x such that puriﬁed sample P(x; ψ) has the same label as x0 under f. Further, we deﬁne the robust radius of x0 as rf P(x0; ψ) := max { r: x0 + ru∈Df P(x0; ψ) , ∀||u||2 ≤1 } , i.e., the radius of maximum inclined ball of Df P(x0; ψ) centered around x0. We will omit Pand f when it is clear from the context and write D(G(x0); ψ) and r(x0; ψ) instead. Remark 2. In Deﬁnition 3.2, the robust region (resp. radius) is deﬁned for each class (resp. point). When using the point with highest P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) as the reversed sample, ψ:= t. Now given a sample x0 with ground-truth label, we are ready to characterize the robust region D(G(x0); ψ) under puriﬁcation model P(·; t) and classiﬁer f. Intuitively, if the adversarial sample xa is near to x0 (in Euclidean distance), xa keeps the same label semantics of x0 and so as the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t), which implies that f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0). However, the condition that xa is near to x0 is sufﬁcient but not necessary since we can still achieve f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0) if xa is near to any sample ˜x0 with f(P(˜xa; ψ)) = f(x0). In the following, we will show that the robust region D(G(x0); ψ) is the union of the convex robust sub-regions surrounding every ˜x0 with the same label as x0. The following theorem characterizes the convex robust sub-region and robust region respectively. Theorem 3.3. Under conditions B.1 and classiﬁer f, let x0 be the sample with ground-truth label and xa be the adversarial sample, then (i) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if xa falls into the following convex set, Dsub (x0; t) := ⋂ {x′ 0:f(x′ 0)̸=f(x0)} { xa : (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + ||x′ 0 −x0||2 2 2 } , and further, (ii) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if and only if xa falls into the following set, D(G(x0); t) := ⋃ ˜x0:f(˜x0)=f(x0) Dsub (˜x0; t). In other words, D(G(x0); t) is the robust region for data regionG(x0) under P(·; t) and f. 4DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Proof. (sketch) (i). Each convex half-space deﬁned by the inequality corresponds to a x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0) where xa within satisﬁes P(ˆx0 = x0|ˆxt = xa,t) >P(ˆx0 = x′ 0 |ˆxt = xxxa,t). This implies that P(xa; t) ̸= x′ 0 and f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0). The convexity is due to that the intersection of convex sets is convex. (ii). The “if” follows directly from (i). The “only if” holds because if xa /∈ D(G(x0); t), then exists ˜x1 such that f(˜x1) ̸= f(x0) and P(ˆx0 = ˜x1|ˆxt = xa,t) > P(ˆx0 = ˜x0|ˆxt = xa,t) ,∀˜x0 s.t. f(˜x0) = f(x0), and thus f(P(xa; ψ)) ̸= f(x0). Remark 3. Theorem 3.3 implies that when data region G(x0) has higher data density and larger distances to data regions with other labels, it tends to have larger robust region and points in data region tends to have larger radius. In the literature, people focus more on the robust radius (lower bound) r(G(x0); t) (Cohen et al., 2019; Carlini et al., 2022), which can be obtained by ﬁnding the maximum inclined ball inside D(G(x0); t) centering x0. Note that although Dsub (x0; t) is convex, D(G(x0); t) is generally not. Therefore, ﬁnding r(G(x0); t) is a non-convex optimization problem. In particular, it can be formulated into a disjunctive optimization problem with integer indicator variables, which is typi- cally NP-hard to solve. One alternative could be ﬁnding the maximum inclined ball in Dsub (x0; t), which can be formulated into a convex optimization problem whose optimal value provides a lower bound for r(G(x0); t). However, D(G(x0); t) has the potential to provide much larger robustness radius because it might connect different convex robust sub-regions into one, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: An illustration of the robust region D(x0; t) = ⋃3 i=1 Dsub(xi; t), where x0,x1,x2 are samples with ground-truth label andx3 is a sample with another label.xa = x0+ϵais an adversarial sample such that P(xa; t) = x1 ̸= x0 and thus the classiﬁcation is correct but xa is not reversed back to x0. rsub(x0) <r(x0) shows our claim that the union leads to a larger robust radius. In practice, we cannot guarantee to establish an exact reverse process like reverse-SDE but instead try to establish an approximate reverse process to mimic the exact one. As long as the approximate reverse process is close enough to the exact reverse process, they will generate close enough con- ditional distributions based on the adversarial sample. Then the density and locations of the data regions in two conditional distributions will not differ much and so is the robust region for each data region. We take the score-based diffusion model in Song et al. (2021b) for an example and demonstrate Theorem 3.4 to bound the KL-divergnece between conditional distributions generated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model. Ho et al. (2020) showed that using variational inference to ﬁt DDPM is equivalent to optimizing an objective resembling score-based diffusion model with a speciﬁc weighting scheme, so the results can be extended to DDPM. Theorem 3.4. Under score-based diffusion model Song et al. (2021b) and conditions B.1, we have DKL(P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t)) = JSM(θ,t; λ(·)), where {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] are stochastic processes generated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model respectively, JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) := 1 2 ∫t 0 Epτ(x) [ λ(τ) ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ,sθ(x,τ) is the score function to approximate ∇x log pτ(x), and λ : R →R is any weighting scheme used in the training score-based diffusion models. Proof. (sketch) Let µtand νtbe the path measure for reverse processes{ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] respectively based on the xa,t. Under conditions B.1, µt and νt are uniquely deﬁned and the KL- divergence can be computed via the Girsanov theorem Oksendal (2013). 5DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Remark 4. Theorem 3.4 shows that if the training loss is smaller, the conditional distributions gen- erated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model are closer, and are the same if the training loss is zero. 4 DENSE PURE Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we introduceDensePure and show how to calculate its certiﬁed robustness radius via the randomized smoothing algorithm. Framework. Our framework, DensePure, consists of two components: (1) an off-the-shelf diffu- sion model with reverse process rev and (2) an off-the-shelf base classiﬁer f. The pipeline of DensePure is shown in Figure 1. Given an input x, we feed it into the reverse pro- cess rev of the diffusion model to get the reversed samplerev(x) and then repeat the above process K times to get K reversed samples {rev(x)1,··· ,rev(x)K}. We feed the above K reversed samples into the classiﬁer to get the corresponding prediction {f(rev(x)1),··· ,f(rev(x)K)} and then apply the majority vote, termed MV, on these predictions to get the ﬁnal predicted la- bel ˆy= MV({f(rev(x)1),··· ,f(rev(x)K)}) = arg maxc ∑K i=1 111{f(rev(x)i) = c}. Certiﬁed Robustness of DensePure with Randomized Smoothing. In this paragraph, we will illustrate the algorithm to calculate certiﬁed robustness ofDensePure via RS, which offers robustness guarantees for a model under a L2-norm ball. In particular, we follow the similar setting of Carlini et al. (2022) which uses a DDPM-based diffu- sion model. The overall algorithm contains three steps: (1) Our framework estimates n, the number of steps used for the reverse process of DDPM-based diffusion model. Since Randomized Smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) adds Gaussian noise ϵ, where ϵ∼N (0,σ2I), to data input xto get the randomized data input, xrs = x+ ϵ, we map between the noise required by the randomized example xrs and the noise required by the diffused data xn (i.e., xn ∼N (xn; √αnx0,(1 −αn)I)) with nstep diffusion processing so that αn = 1 1+σ2 . In this way, we can compute the corresponding timestep n, where n = arg mins{|αs − 1 1+σ2 || s ∈ {1,2,··· ,N}}. (2). Given the above calculated timestep n, we scale xrs with √αn to obtain the scaled randomized smoothing sample √αnxrs. Then we feed √αnxrs into the reverse process of the diffusion model by K-times to get the reversed sample set {ˆx1 0,ˆx2 0,··· ,ˆxi 0,··· ,ˆxK 0 }. (3). We feed the obtained reversed sample set into a standard off-the-shelf classiﬁer f to get the corresponding predicted labels {f(ˆx1 0),f(ˆx2 0),...,f (ˆxi 0),...,f (ˆxK 0 )}, and apply majority vote, denoted MV(···), on these predicted labels to get the ﬁnal label for xrs. Fast Sampling. To calculate the reversed sample, the standard reverse process of DDPM-based models require repeatedly applying a “single-step” operation ntimes to get the reversed sample ˆx0 (i.e., ˆx0 = Reverse(···Reverse(···Reverse(Reverse(√αnxrs; n); n−1); ··· ; i); ···1)   nsteps ). Here ˆxi−1 = Reverse(ˆxi; i) is equivalent to sample ˆxi−1 from N(ˆxi−1; µθ(ˆxi,i),Σθ(ˆxi,i)), where µθ(ˆxi,i) = 1√1−βi ( ˆxi − βi√1−αi ϵθ(ˆxi,i) ) and Σθ := exp(vlog βi + (1 −v) log ˜βi). Here vis a parameter learned by DDPM and ˜βi = 1−αi−1 1−αi . To reduce the time complexity, we use the uniform sub-sampling strategy from Nichol & Dhari- wal (2021). We uniformly sample a subsequence with size b from the original N-step the re- verse process. Note that Carlini et al. (2022) set b = 1 for the “one-shot” sampling, in this way, ˆx0 = 1√αn (xn−√1 −αnϵθ(√αnxrs,n)) is a deterministic value so that the reverse process does not obtain a posterior data distribution conditioned on the input. Instead, we can tune the num- ber of the sub-sampled DDPM steps to be larger than one ( b >1) to sample from a posterior data distribution conditioned on the input.

The lines represent the certiﬁed accuracy with different L2 perturbation bound with different Gaussian noise σ∈{0.25,0.50,1.00}. 5 E XPERIMENTS In this section, we useDensePure to evaluate certiﬁed robustness on two standard datasets, CIFAR- 10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Experimental settings We follow the experimental setting from Carlini et al. (2022). Speciﬁcally, for CIFAR-10, we use the 50-M unconditional improved diffusion model from Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) as the diffusion model. We select ViT-B/16 model Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) pretrained on ImageNet-21k and ﬁnetuned on CIFAR-10 as the classiﬁer, which could achieve 97.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10. For ImageNet, we use the unconditional 256 ×256 guided diffusion model from Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) as the diffusion model and pretrained BEiT large model (Bao et al., 2021) trained on ImageNet-21k as the classiﬁer, which could achieve 88.6% top-1 accuracy on validation set of ImageNet-1k. We select three different noise levels σ ∈{0.25,0.5,1.0}for certiﬁcation. For the parameters of DensePure , we set K = 40 and b= 10 except the results in ablation study. The details about the baselines are in the appendix. 5.1 M AIN RESULTS We compare our results with other baselines. The results are shown in Table 1. For CIFAR-10, comparing with the models which are carefully trained with randomized smoothing techniques in an end-to-end manner (i.e., w/o off-the-shelf classiﬁer), we observe that our method with the standard off-the-shelf classiﬁer outperforms them at smaller ϵ = {0.25,0.5}on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets while achieves comparable performance at largerϵ= {0.75,1.0}. Comparing with the non-diffusion model based methods with off-the-shelf classiﬁer (i.e., De- noised (Salman et al., 2020) and Lee (Lee, 2021)), both our method and Carlini et al. (2022) are signiﬁcantly better than them. These results verify the non-trivial adversarial robustness improve- 7DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Figure 4: Ablation study on ImageNet. The left image shows the certiﬁed accuracy among different vote numbers with different radius ϵ ∈{0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75}. Each line in the ﬁgure represents the certiﬁed accuracy of our method among different vote numbers K with Gaussian noise σ = 0.25. The right image shows the certiﬁed accuracy with different fast sampling steps b. Each line in the ﬁgure shows the certiﬁed accuracy among different L2 adversarial perturbation bound. ments introduced from the diffusion model. For ImageNet, our method is consistently better than all priors with a large margin. Since both Carlini et al. (2022) and DensePure use the diffusion model, to better understand the importance of our design, that approximates the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution, we compare DensePure with Carlini et al. (2022) in a more ﬁne-grained manner. We show detailed certiﬁed robustness of the model among differentσat different radius for CIFAR- 10 in Figure 3-left and for ImageNet in Figure 3-right. We also present our results of certiﬁed accu- racy at different ϵin Appendix D.3. From these results, we ﬁnd that our method is still consistently better at mostϵ(except ϵ= 0) among differentσ. The performance margin between ours and Carlini et al. (2022) will become even larger with a large ϵ. These results further indicate that although the diffusion model improves model robustness, leveraging the posterior data distribution conditioned on the input instance (like DensePure ) via reverse process instead of using single sample ((Carlini et al., 2022)) is the key for better robustness. Additionally, we use the off-the-shelf classiﬁers, which are the VIT-based architectures trained a larger dataset. In the later ablation study section, we select the CNN-based architecture wide-ResNet trained on standard dataset from scratch. Our method still achieves non-trivial robustness. 5.2 A BLATION STUDY Voting samples (K) We ﬁrst show how K affects the certiﬁed accuracy. For efﬁciency, we select b= 10. We conduct experiments for both datasets. We show the certiﬁed accuracy among differentr at σ= 0.25 in Figure 4. The results for σ= 0.5,1.0 and CIFAR-10 are shown in the Appendix D.4. Comparing with the baseline (Carlini et al., 2022), we ﬁnd that a larger majority vote number leads to a better certiﬁed accuracy. It veriﬁes that DensePure indeed beneﬁts the adversarial robustness and making a good approximation of the label with high density region requires a large number of voting samples. We ﬁnd that our certiﬁed accuracy will almost converge at r = 40. Thus, we set r= 40 for our experiments. The results with other σshow the similar tendency. Fast sampling steps ( b) To investigate the role of b, we conduct additional experiments with b ∈ {2,5}at σ= 0.25. The results on ImageNet are shown in Figure 4 and results for σ= 0.5,1.0 and CIFAR-10 are shown in the Appendix D.5. By observing results with majority vote, we ﬁnd that a larger bcan lead to a better certiﬁed accuracy since a larger bgenerates images with higher quality. By observing results without majority vote, the results show opposite conclusions where a larger b leads to a lower certiﬁed accuracy, which contradicts to our intuition. We guess the potential reason is that though more sampling steps can normally lead to better image recovery quality, it also brings more randomness, increasing the probability that the reversed image locates into a data region with the wrong label. These results further verify that majority vote is necessary for a better performance. Different architectures One advantage of DensePure is to use the off-the-shelf classiﬁer so that it can plug in any classiﬁer. We choose Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures: Wide-ResNet28-10 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) for CIFAR-10 with95.1% accuracy and Wide- 8DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Certiﬁed Accuracy atϵ(%)Datasets Methods Model 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 Model 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 CIFAR-10 Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) ViT-B/1693.0 76.0 57.0 47.0 WRN28-10 86.0 66.0 55.0 37.0Ours ViT-B/16 92.082.0 69.0 56.0 WRN28-1090.0 77.0 63.0 50.0 ImageNet Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) BEiT 77.0 76.0 71.0 60.0WRN50-2 73.0 67.0 57.0 48.0Ours BEiT 80.0 78.0 76.0 71.0 WRN50-281.0 72.0 66.0 61.0 Table 2: Certiﬁed accuracy of our method among different classiﬁer.

WideRes- Net is trained on ImageNet-1k for ImageNet and trained on CIFAR-10 from scratch for CIFAR-10. ResNet50-2 for ImageNet with 81.5% top-1 accuracy, atσ= 0.25. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure E in Appendix D.6. Results for more model architectures and σ of ImageNet are also shown in Appendix D.6. We show that our method can enhance the certiﬁed robustness of any given classiﬁer trained on the original data distribution. Noticeably, although the performance of CNN- based classiﬁer is lower than Transformer-based classiﬁer, DensePure with CNN-based model as the classiﬁer can outperform Carlini et al. (2022) with ViT-based model as the classiﬁer (except ϵ= 0 for CIFAR-10). 6 R ELATED WORK Using an off-the-shelf generative model to purify adversarial perturbations has become an important direction in adversarial defense. Previous works have developed various puriﬁcation methods based on different generative models, such as GANs (Samangouei et al., 2018), autoregressive generative models (Song et al., 2018), and energy-based models (Du & Mordatch, 2019; Grathwohl et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2021). More recently, as diffusion models (or score-based models) achieve better generation quality than other generative models (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), many works consider using diffusion models for adversarial puriﬁcation (Nie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022) Although they have found good empirical results in defending against existing adversarial attacks (Nie et al., 2022), there is no provable guarantee about the robustness about such methods. On the other hand, certiﬁed defenses provide guarantees of robustness (Mirman et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019; Lecuyer et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2020; Horv´ath et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018a;b; Salman et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2021). They provide a lower bounder of model accuracy under constrained perturbations. Among them, approaches Lecuyer et al. (2019); Cohen et al. (2019); Salman et al. (2019a); Jeong & Shin (2020); Zhai et al. (2020); Horv´ath et al. (2021); Jeong et al. (2021); Salman et al. (2020); Lee (2021); Carlini et al. (2022) based on randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) show the great scalability and achieve promising performance on large network and dataset. The most similar work to us is Carlini et al. (2022), which uses diffusion models combined with standard classiﬁers for certiﬁed defense. They view diffusion model as blackbox without having a theoretical under- standing of why and how the diffusion models contribute to such nontrivial certiﬁed robustness. 7 C ONCLUSION In this work, we theoretically prove that the diffusion model could purify adversarial examples back to the corresponding clean sample with high probability, as long as the data density of the cor- responding clean samples is high enough. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the conditional distribution of the reversed samples given the adversarial input, generated by the diffusion model reverse process. Using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the deterministic reversed sample, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model re- verse process, which is potentially much larger than previous methods. Our analysis inspires us to propose an effective pipeline DensePure, for adversarial robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the effectiveness of DensePure by evaluating the certiﬁed robustness via the randomized smoothing algorithm. Note that DensePure is an off-the-shelf pipeline that does not require training a smooth classiﬁer. Our results show that DensePure achieves the new SOTA cer- tiﬁed robustness for perturbation with L2-norm. We hope that our work sheds light on an in-depth understanding of the diffusion model for adversarial robustness. 9DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Limitations. The time complexity of DensePure is high since it requires repeating the reverse process multiple times. In this paper, we use fast sampling to reduce the time complexity and show that the setting ( b = 2 and K = 10) can achieve nontrivial certiﬁed accuracy. We leave the more advanced fast sampling strategy as the future direction. ETHICS STATEMENT Our work can positively impact the society by improving the robustness and security of AI systems. We have not involved human subjects or data set releases; instead, we carefully follow the provided licenses of existing data and models for developing and evaluating our method.

Under conditions B.1, solving equation reverse-SDE starting from time tand point xa,t = √αtxa will generate a reversed random variable ˆx0 with conditional distribution P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) ∝p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t where σ2 t = 1−αt αt is the variance of the Gaussian noise added at timestamp t in the diffusion process SDE. Proof. Under the assumption, we know {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] follow the same distribution, which means P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) = P(ˆx0 = x,ˆxt = xa,t) P(ˆxt = xa,t) = P(x0 = x,xt = xa,t) P(xt = xa,t) = P(x0 = x) P(xt = xa,t|x0 = x) P(xt = xa,t) ∝P(x0 = x) 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t = p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t where the third equation is due to the chain rule of probability and the last equation is a result of the diffusion process. Theorem 3.3. Under conditions B.1 and classiﬁer f, let x0 be the sample with ground-truth label and xa be the adversarial sample, then (i) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if xa falls into the following convex set, Dsub (x0; t) := ⋂ {x′ 0:f(x′ 0)̸=f(x0)} { xa : (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + ||x′ 0 −x0||2 2 2 } , and further, (ii) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if and only if xa falls into the following set, D(G(x0); t) := ⋃ ˜x0:f(˜x0)=f(x0) Dsub (˜x0; t). In other words, D(G(x0); t) is the robust region for data regionG(x0) under P(·; t) and f. Proof. We start with part (i). 14DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness The main idea is to prove that a point x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0) should have lower density than x0 in the conditional distribution in Theorem 3.1 so thatP(xa; t) cannot be x′ 0. In other words, we should have P(ˆx0 = x0|ˆxt = xa,t) >P(ˆx0 = x′ 0 |ˆxt = xxxa,t) . By Theorem 3.1, this is equivalent to p(x0) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x0−xa||2 2 2σ2 t >p(x′ 0) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x′ 0−xa||2 2 2σ2 t ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( ||x0 −xa||2 2 −||x′ 0 −xa||2 2 ) ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( ||x0 −xa||2 2 −||x′ 0 −x0 + x0 −xa||2 2 ) ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( 2(xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) −∥x′ 0 −x0∥2 2 ) . Re-organizing the above inequality, we obtain (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + 1 2||x′ 0 −x0||2 2. Note that the order of xa is at most one in every term of the above inequality, so the inequality actually deﬁnes a half-space in Rn for every (x0,x′ 0) pair. Further, we have to satisfy the inequality for every x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0), therefore, by intersecting over all such half-spaces, we obtain a convex Dsub (x0; t). Then we prove part (ii). On the one hand, if xa ∈D (G(x0); t), then there exists one ˜x0 such that f(˜x0) = f(x0) and xa ∈Dsub (˜x0; t). By part (i), ˜x0 has higher probability than all other points with different la- bels from x0 in the conditional distribution P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) characterized by Theorem 3.1. Therefore, P(xa; t) should have the same label as x0. On the other hand, if xa /∈D (G(x0); t), then there is a point ˜x1 with different label from x0 such that for any ˜x0 with the same label as x0, P(ˆx0 = ˜x1|ˆxt = xa,t) > P(ˆx0 = ˜x0|ˆxt = xa,t). In other words, P(xa; t) would have different label from x0. Theorem 3.4. Under score-based diffusion model Song et al. (2021b) and conditions B.1, we can bound DKL(P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t)) = JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) where {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] are stochastic processes generated by reverse-SDE and score- based diffusion model respectively, JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) := 1 2 ∫ t 0 Epτ(x) [ λ(τ) ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ, sθ(x,τ) is the score function to approximate∇x log pτ(x), and λ: R →R is any weighting scheme used in the training score-based diffusion models. Proof. Similar to proof of (Song et al., 2021a, Theorem 1), let µt and νt be the path measure for reverse processes {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] respectively based on the scaled adversarial sample xa,t. Under conditions B.1, the KL-divergence can be computed via the Girsanov theorem Oksendal 15DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness (2013): DKL ( P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t) ) = −Eµt [ log dνt dµt ] (i) = Eµt [∫ t 0 g(τ) (∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)) dwτ + 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 dτ ] = Eµt [1 2 ∫ t 0 g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 dτ ] = 1 2 ∫ τ 0 Epτ(x) [ g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ = JSM ( θ,t; g(·)2) where (i) is due to Girsanov Theorem and (ii) is due to the martingale property of Itˆo integrals.

In order to reduce the time complexity, we follow the method used in (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) and sample a subsequence Sb with bvalues (i.e., Sb = {n,⌊n−n b⌋,··· ,1}    b , where Sb j is the j-th element in Sb and Sb j = ⌊n−jn b ⌋,∀j < band Sb b = 1) from the original schedule S (i.e., S = {n,n −1,··· ,1}   n , where Sj = jis the j-th element in S). Within this context, we adapt the original αschedule αS = {α1,··· ,αi,··· ,αn}used for single- step to the new schedule αSb = {αSb 1 ,··· ,αSb j ,··· ,αSb b }(i.e., αSb i = αSb i = αS⌊n−in b ⌋ is the i-th element in αSb ). We calculate the corresponding βSb = {βSb 1 ,βSb 2 ,··· ,βSb i ,··· ,βSb b }and ˜βSb = {˜βSb 1 ,˜βSb 2 ,··· ,˜βSb i ,··· ,˜βSb b }schedules, where βSb i = βSb i = 1 − αSb i αSb i−1 , ˜βSb i = ˜βSb i = 1−αSb i−1 1−αSb i βSb i . With these new schedules, we can use b times reverse steps to calculate 16DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Certiﬁed Accuracy atϵ(%) Methods Noise 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 σ= 0.25 88.0 73.8 56.2 41.6 0.0 Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022)σ= 0.5 74.2 62.0 50.4 40.2 31.0 σ= 1.0 49.4 41.4 34.2 27.8 21.8 σ= 0.25 87.6(-0.4) 76.6(+2.8) 64.6(+8.4) 50.4(+8.8) 0.0(+0.0) Ours σ= 0.5 73.6(-0.6) 65.4(+3.4) 55.6(+5.2) 46.0(+5.8) 37.4(+6.4) σ= 1.0 55.0(+5.6) 47.8(+6.4) 40.8(+6.6) 33.0(+5.2) 28.2(+6.4) Table A: Certiﬁed accuracy compared with Carlini et al.

D M ORE EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS D.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS We select three different noise levels σ ∈ {0.25,0.5,1.0}for certiﬁcation. For the parameters of DensePure , The sampling numbers when computing the certiﬁed radius are n = 100000 for CIFAR-10 andn= 10000 for ImageNet. We evaluate the certiﬁed robustness on 500 samples subset of CIFAR-10 testset and 500 samples subset of ImageNet validation set. we set K = 40 and b= 10 except the results in ablation study. The details about the baselines are in the appendix. D.2 B ASELINES . We select randomized smoothing based methods including PixelDP (Lecuyer et al., 2019), RS (Co- hen et al., 2019), SmoothAdv (Salman et al., 2019a), Consistency (Jeong & Shin, 2020), MACER (Zhai et al., 2020), Boosting (Horv ´ath et al., 2021) , SmoothMix (Jeong et al., 2021), Denoised (Salman et al., 2020), Lee (Lee, 2021), Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) as our baselines. Among them, PixelDP, RS, SmoothAdv, Consistency, MACER, and SmoothMix require training a smooth clas- siﬁer for a better certiﬁcation performance while the others do not. Salman et al. and Lee use the off-the-shelf classiﬁer but without using the diffusion model. The most similar one compared with us is Carlini et al., which also uses both the off-the-shelf diffusion model and classiﬁer. The above two settings mainly refer to Carlini et al. (2022), which makes us easier to compared with their results. D.3 M AIN RESULTS FOR CERTIFIED ACCURACY We compare with Carlini et al. (2022) in a more ﬁne-grained version.

While attempts to train improved classifiers with synthetic data have proved challenging, Azizi et al. [2] impressively demonstrated that extending the training dataset with synthetic images generated using Imagen [38] — with appropriate sampling parameters (e.g. prompt and guidance strength) — could indeed improve Imagenet classification. In a similar experiment with Stable Diffusion (SD) [ 37], Sariyildiz et al. [41] studied classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic images (i.e. no real images) and discovered improvements when training on a subset of 100 Imagenet classes. The success of generative data augmentation depends crucially on sample quality [36], so these findings irrefutably highlight the superior generative abilities of diffusion models. Despite these impressive findings, widespread adoption of diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation is constrained by high computational cost of diffusion sampling, which requires multiple steps of reverse diffusion to ensure sufficient sample quality. Furthermore, both SD and Imagen are trained on upstream datasets much larger than Imagenet and some of these improvements could also be attributed to the quality and scale of the upstream dataset [18]. For example, Bansal and Grover [4] find no advantage in synthetic examples generated from a diffusion model trained solely on Imagenet. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2306.09192v2  [cs.CV]  29 May 2024Together, these limitations motivate us to explore a diffusion-based augmentation technique that is not only computationally efficient but can also enhance classifier training without relying on extra data. To that end, we consider the following questions: 1. Can we leverage a diffusion model trained with no extra data? 2. Can we train improved classifiers with a single step of reverse diffusion? In the context of reverse diffusion sampling, the intermediate output obtained after one reverse diffusion (i.e., denoising) step is commonly interpreted as an approximation of the final image by previous works and has been utilised to define the guidance function at each step of guided reverse- diffusion (e.g., [3, 9, 10]). Similarly, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) [ 5] applies denoised smoothing [39], a certified adversarial defense for pretrained classifiers, using one reverse diffusion step. In contrast to previous work, we use the output from a single reverse diffusion step as an augmentation to train classifiers (i.e., not just at inference time) as we describe next. Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation Considering a diffusion model defined such that time t = 0 refers to the data distribution and time t = T refers to isotropic Gaussian noise, we propose to generate augmentations of train examples by first applying a Gaussian perturbation (i.e., forward- diffusion to a random time t ∈ [0, T]) and then crucially, applying a single diffusion denoising step (i.e., one-step reverse diffusion). That is, we treat these diffused-and-denoised examples as augmentations of the original train image and refer to this technique as DiffAug. A one-step diffusion denoised example derived from a Gaussian perturbed train example can also be interpreted as an intermediate sample in some reverse diffusion sequence that starts with pure noise and ends at the train example. Interpreted this way, our classifier can be viewed as having been trained on partially- synthesized images whose ostensible quality varies from unrecognizable (DiffAug using t ≈ T) to excellent (DiffAug using t ≈ 0). This is surprising because, while Ravuri and Vinyals [36] find that expanding the train dataset even with a small fraction of (lower quality) synthetic examples can lead to noticeable drops in classification accuracy, we find that classifier accuracy over test examples does not degrade despite being explicitly trained with partially synthesized train images. Instead, we show that diffusion-denoised examples offer a regularization effect when training classifiers that leads to improved classifier robustness without sacrificing clean test accuracy and without requiring additional data. Our contributions in this work are as follows: (a) DiffAug We propose DiffAug, a simple, efficient and effective diffusion-based augmentation technique. We provide a qualitative and analytical discussion on the unique regularization effect — complementary to other leading and classic augmentation methods — introduced by DiffAug. (b) Robust Classification. Using both ResNet-50 and ViT architectures, we evaluate the models in terms of their robustness to covariate shifts, adversarial examples (i.e., certified accuracy under Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)[5]) and out-of-distribution detection. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble (DE) We extend DiffAug to test-time and introduce DE, a simple test-time image augmentation/adaptation technique to improve robustness to covariate shift that is not only competitive with DDA [17], the state-of-the-art image adaptation method but also 10x faster. (d) Perceptual Gradient Alignment. Motivated by the success of DDS and evidence of perceptually aligned gradients (PAGs) in robust classifiers, we qualitatively analyse the classifier gradients and discover the perceptual alignment described in previous works. We then theoretically analyse the gradients through the score function to explain this perceptual alignment. (e) Improved Classifier-Guided Diffusion. Finally, we build on (d) to improve gradient quality in guidance classifiers and demonstrate improvements in terms of: (i) generalization, (ii) perceptual gradient alignment and (iii) image generation performance. 2 Background The stochastic diffusion framework [43] consists of two key components: 1) the forward-diffusion (i.e., data to noise) stochastic process, and 2) a learnable score-function that can then be used for the reverse-diffusion (i.e., noise to data) stochastic process. The forward diffusion stochastic process {xt}t∈[0,T] starts at data, x0, and ends at noise, xT . We let pt(x) denote the probability density of x at time t such that p0(x) is the data distribution, and pT (x) 2denotes the noise distribution. The diffusion is defined with a stochastic-differential-equation (SDE): dx = f(x, t) dt + g(t) dw, (1) where w denotes a standard Wiener process, f(x, t) is a drift coefficient, and g(t) is a diffusion coefficient. The drift and diffusion coefficients are usually specified manually such that the solution to the SDE with initial value x0 is a time-varying Gaussian distribution pt(x|x0) whose mean µ(x0, t) and standard deviation σ(t) can be exactly computed. To sample from p0(x) starting with samples from pT (x), we solve the reverse diffusion SDE [1]: dx = [f(x, t) − g(t)2∇x log pt(x)] dt + g(t) d¯ w, (2) where d¯ wis a standard Wiener process when time flows from T to 0, and dt is an infinitesimal negative timestep. In practice, the score function ∇x log pt(x) is estimated by a neural network sθ(x, t), parameterized by θ, trained using a score-matching loss [43]. Denoised Examples. Given (x0, y) ∼ p0 and x ∼ pt(x|x0) = N(x | µ(x0, t), σ2(t)I), we can compute the denoised image ˆxt using the pretrained score network sθ as: ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t) (3) Intuitively, ˆxt is an expectation over all possible images mt = µ(x0, t) that are likely to have been perturbed with N(0, σ2(t)I) to generate x and the denoised example ˆxt can be written as ˆxt = E[mt|x] = Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt (4) We note that the mean does not change with diffusion time t in variance-exploding SDEs while the mean decays to zero with diffusion time for variance-preserving SDEs (DDPMs). 3 DiffAug: Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation 𝐱! 𝐱\"!𝐱\"\" Figure 1: DiffAug Augmentations. The leftmost col- umn shows four original training examples (x0); to the right of that, we display 8 random augmentations ( ˆxt) for each image between t = 350and t = 700in steps of size 50. Augmentations generated for t <350 are closer to the input image while the augmentations for t >700 are farther from the input image. We observe that the diffusion denoised augmentations with larger values of t do not preserve the class label introducing noise in the training procedure. However, we find that this does not lead to empirical degradation of classification accuracy but instead contributes to improved robustness. Also, see Fig. 6 in appendix for a toy 2d example. In this section, we describe Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation (DiffAug, in short) and then pro- vide an analytical and qualitative discussion on the role of denoised examples in training clas- sifiers. While we are not aware of any previous study on training classifiers with denoised ex- amples, Diffusion-denoised smoothing (DDS) [5], DiffPure [33] and Diffusion Driven Adap- tation (DDA) [ 17] are test-time applications of — single-step (DDS) and multi-step (Diff- Pure/DDA) — denoised examples to promote robustness in pretrained classifiers. As implied by its name, DiffAug consists of two key steps: (i) Diffuse: first, we diffuse a train example x0 to a uniformly sampled time t ∼ U(0, T) and generate x ∼ pt(x|x0); (ii) Denoise: then, we denoise x using a single ap- plication of trained score network sθ as shown in Eq. 3 to generate ˆxt. We assume that the class label does not change upon augmentation (see discussion below) and train the classifier to minimize the following cross-entropy loss: L = Et,x0 [−log pϕ(y|ˆxt)] (5) where, t ∼ U(0, T), (x0, y) ∼ p0(x), and pϕ denotes the classifier parameterized by ϕ. In this work, we show the effectiveness of DiffAug as a standalone augmentation technique, as well as the further compounding effect of combining it with robustness-enhancing techniques such as Augmix and DeepAugment, showing that DiffAug is achieving a robustness not captured by the other approaches. When combining DiffAug with such novel augmentation techniques, we simply include Eq. 5 as an additional optimization objective instead of stacking augmentations (for example, we can alternatively apply DiffAug to images augmented with Augmix/DeepAugment or vice-versa). Also, our preliminary analysis on stacking augmentations showed limited gains over simply training the network to classify independently augmented samples likely because training on independent augmentations implicitly generalizes to stacked augmentations. 3Qualitative Analysis and Manifold Theory. When generating augmentations, it is important to ensure that the resulting augmentations lie on the image manifold. Recent studies [ 9, 34] on theoretical properties of denoised examples suggest that denoised examples can be considered to be on the data manifold under certain assumptions lending theoretical support to the idea of using denoised examples as augmentations. We can interpret training on denoised examples as a type of Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) since the denoised examples can be considered to lie in the vicinal distribution of training samples. Previous works have shown that VRM improves generalization: for example, Chapelle et al. [8] use Gaussian perturbed examples (x) as the vicinal distribution while MixUp [52] uses a convex sum of two random inputs (and their labels) as the vicinal distribution. From Eq. 4, we can observe that a denoised example is a convex sum over mt and we can interpret ˆxt as being vicinal to examples mt that have a non-trivial likelihood, pt(mt|x), of generating x. The distribution pt(mt|x) is concentrated around examples perceptually similar to µ(x0, t) when x is closer to x0 (i.e., smaller σ(t)) and becomes more entropic as the noise scale increases: we can qualitatively observe this in Fig. 1. Diffusion denoised augmentations generated from larger σ(t) can introduce label-noise into the training since the class-labels may not be preserved upon augmentation – for example, some of the diffusion denoised augmentations of the dog in Fig. 1 resemble architectural buildings. Augmenta- tions that alter the true class-label are said to cause manifold intrusion [20] leading to underfitting and lower classification accuracies. In particular, accurate predictions on class-altered augmented examples would be incorrectly penalised causing the classifier to output less confident predictions on all inputs (i.e., underfitting). Interestingly, however, diffusion denoised augmentations that alter the true-class label are also of lower sample quality. The correlation between label noise and sample qual- ity allows the model to selectively lower its prediction confidence when classifying denoised samples generated from larger perturbations applied to x0 (we empirically confirm this in Section 4). In other words, the classifier learns to observe important details in ˆxt to determine the optimal prediction estimating the class-membership probabilities of x0. On the other hand, any augmentation that alters class-label by preserving the sample quality can impede the classifier training since the classifier cannot rely on visual cues to selectively lower its confidence (for an example, see Fig. 7 in appendix). Therefore, we do not consider multi-step denoising techniques to generate augmentations — despite their potential to improve sample quality — since this would effectively decorrelate label-noise and sample-quality necessitating additional safeguards — e.g., we would then need to determine the maximum diffusion time we could use for augmentation without altering the class-label or scale down the loss terms corresponding to samples generated from larger σ(t) — that are out of scope of this work. Test-time Augmentation with DiffAug. Test-time Augmentation (TTA) [28] is a technique to improve classifier prediction using several augmented copies of a single test example. A simple yet successful TTA technique is to just average the model predictions for each augmentation of a test sample. We extend DiffAug to generate test-time augmentations of a test-example wherein we apply DiffAug using different values of diffusion times t and utilize the average predictions across all the augmentations to classify the test example x0: p(y|x0) = 1 |S| X t∈S pϕ(y|ˆxt) (6) where, S denotes the set of diffusion times considered. We refer to this as DiffAug Ensemble (DE). A forward diffusion step followed by diffusion denoising can be interpreted as projecting a test-example with unknown distribution shift into the source distribution and forms the basis of DDA, a diffusion-based image adaptation technique. Different from DE, DDA uses a novel multi-step denoising technique to transform the diffused test example into the source distribution. Since DE uses single-step denoised examples of forward diffused samples, we observe significant improvement in terms of running time while either improving over or remaining on par with DDA. 4 Experiments I: Classifier Robustness In this section, we evaluate classifiers trained with DiffAug in terms of their standard classification accuracy as well as their robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial examples. We primarily conduct our experiments on Imagenet-1k and use the unconditional 256 ×256 Improved-DDPM [13, 32] diffusion model to generate the augmentations. We apply DiffAug to train the popular ResNet-50 (RN-50) backbone as well as the recent Vision-Transformer (ViT) model (ViT-B-16, in 4Table 1: Top-1 Accuracy (%) on Imagenet-C (severity=5) and Imagenet-Test. We summarize the results for each combination of Train-augmentations and evaluation modes. The average (avg) accuracies for each classifier and evaluation mode is shown.

In addition to extending the default augmentations used to train RN-50/ViT with DiffAug, we also combine our method with the following effective robustness-enhancing augmentations: (i) AugMix (AM), (ii) DeepAugment (DA) and (iii) DeepAugment+AugMix (DAM). While we train the RN-50 from scratch, we follow DeIT-III recipe[46] for training ViTs and apply DiffAug in the second training stage; when combining with AM/DA/DAM, we finetune the official checkpoint for 10 epochs. More details are included in Appendix B.1. In the following, we will evaluate the classifier robustness to (i) covariate shifts, (ii) adversarial examples and (iii) out-of-distribution examples. Covariate Shifts To evaluate the classifiers trained with/without DiffAug in terms of their robustness to covariate-shifts, we consider the following evaluation modes: (a) DDA: A diffusion-based test-time image-adaptation technique to transform the test image into the source distribution. (b) DDA-SE: We consider the original test example as well as the DDA-adapted test-example by averaging the classifier predictions following the self-ensemble (SE) strategy proposed in [17]. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble (DE): We use a set of test-time DiffAug augmentations to classify a test example as described in Eq. (6). Following DDA, we determine the following range of diffusion times S = {0, 50, . . . ,450}. In other words, we generate 9 DiffAug augmentations for each test example. (d) Default: In the default mode, we directly evaluate the model on the test examples. We evaluate the classifiers on Imagenet-C, a dataset of 15 synthetic corruptions applied to Imagenet- test and summarize the results across all evaluation modes in Table 1. We summarize our observations as follows: (i) DiffAug introduces consistent improvements Classifiers trained with DiffAug consistently improve over their counterparts trained without these augmentations across all evaluation modes. The average relative improvements across all corruptions range from 5.3% to 28.7% in the default evaluation mode (see Table 5 in Appendix). On clean examples, we observe that DiffAug helps minimize the gap between default evaluation mode and other evaluation modes while effectively preserving the default accuracy. (ii) DE improves over DDA On average, DiffAug Ensemble (DE) yields improved detection rate as compared to direct evaluation on DDA images. Furthermore, DiffAug-trained classifiers evaluated using DE improve on average over their counterparts (trained without DiffAug) evaluated using DDA-SE. This experiment interestingly reveals that a set of one-step diffusion denoised images (DE) can achieve improvements comparable to multi-step diffusion denoised images (DDA) at a substantially faster (∼ 10x) wallclock time (see Table 7 in Appendix). We also evaluate the classifiers on Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S and include the results in the Appendix (Table 6). Although DiffAug training yields slight improvements over Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S 5in default evaluation, we observe that DE introduces some notable improvements over all other evaluation modes.

Test examples whose labels do not overlap with the labels of the train distribution are referred to as out-of-distribution examples. To evaluate the classifiers in terms of their OOD-detection rates, we use the Imagenet near-OOD detection task defined in the OpenOOD benchmark, which also includes an implementation of recent OOD de- tection algorithms such as ASH[14], ReAct[45], Scale[49] and MSP[22]. For context, while the torchvision ResNet-50 checkpoint is most commonly used to evaluate new OOD detection algorithms, AugMix provides the best OOD detection amongst the existing robustness-enhancing augmentation techniques and AugMix/ASH is placed 3rd amongst 73 methods on the OpenOOD leaderboard (ordered by near-OOD performance). Yet in Table 2 we observe that DiffAug introduces further improvement on the challenging near-OOD detection task across all considered OOD algorithms. 0 200 400 600 800 t 0 2 4 6Entropy (nats) Maximum Entropy DA +DiffAug AM +DiffAug DAM +DiffAug Figure 2: Average prediction entropy on DiffAug sam- ples vs diffusion time measured with Imagenet-Test. We observe that the models trained with DiffAug correctly yield predictions with higher entropies (lower confi- dence) for images containing imperceptible details (i.e. larger t). Surprisingly, the classifiers trained without DiffAug do not also assign random-uniform label distri- bution for diffusion denoised images at t = 999, which have no class-related information by construction. Also, see Fig. 9. Comparing our results to the leaderboard, we ob- serve AugMix+DiffAug/Scale achieves an AU- ROC of 84.81 outperforming the second best method (84.01 AUROC) and comparable to the top AUROC of 84.87. DiffAug training teaches the network to selectively lower its prediction confidence (higher prediction entropy) based on the image content (Fig. 2) and we hypothesize that this leads to improved OOD detection rates. We include the detailed OOD detection results in Appendix B.4. Interestingly, the combination of augmentations that improve robustness on covariate shifts may not necessarily lead to im- proved OOD detection rates: for example, Aug- Mix+DeepAugment improves over both Aug- Mix and DeepAugment on covariate shift but achieves lower OOD detection rates than either. On the other hand, we observe that combining with DiffAug enhances both OOD detection as well as robustness to covariate shift. Certified Adversarial Accuracy. Denoised smoothing [39] is a certified defense for pre- trained classifiers inspired from Randomized smoothing [11] wherein noisy copies of a test image are first denoised and then used as classifier input to estimate both the class-label and robust radius for each example. Using the same diffusion model as ours, DDS[5] already achieves state-of-the-art certified Imagenet accuracies with a pretrained 305M-parameter BeIT-L. Here, we evaluate the improvement in certified accuracy when applying DDS to a model trained with DiffAug and include the results in Appendix B.3. We speculate that finetuning the BeIT-L model with DiffAug should lead to similar improvements but skip this experiment since it is computationally expensive. Figure 3: PAG example using ViT+DiffAug. We diffuse the Imagenet example (left) to t = 300and visualise the min-max normalized classifier gradients (right). For easy viewing, we apply contrast maximization. More examples are shown below. Perceptually Aligned Gradients and Robustness Classifier gradients (∇z log pϕ(y|z) where z is an image) which are semantically aligned with human perception are said to be perceptually aligned gradients (PAG) [16]. While input-gradients of a typical image classifier are usually unin- telligible, gradients obtained from adversarially robust classifiers trained using randomized smoothing [26] or adversarial training [15, 40, 48] are perceptually-aligned. Motivated by the state-of-the-art certified adver- sarial accuracy achieved by DDS, we analyse the classifier gradients of one-step diffusion denoised examples — i.e., we analyse∇x log pϕ(y|ˆxt) where x = pt(x|x0) and ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t). We visualise the gra- dients in Fig. 3 and interestingly discover the same perceptual alignment 6of gradients discussed in previous works (we compare with gradients of classifiers trained with randomized smoothing later). To theoretically analyse this effect, we first decompose the input-gradient using chain rule as: d log pϕ(y|ˆxt) dx = d log pϕ(y|ˆxt) dˆxt dˆxt dx (7) Empirically, we find that the perceptual alignment is introduced due to transformation by dˆxt dx and analyse it further: Theorem 4.1. Consider a forward-diffusion SDE defined as in Eq. 1 such that pt(x|x0) = N(x | mt, σ2(t)I) where mt = µ(x0, t). If x ∼ pt(x) and ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t), for opti- mal parameters θ, the derivative of ˆxt w.r.t. x is proportional to the covariance matrix of the conditional distribution p(mt|x). See proof in Appendix B.7. ∂ˆxt ∂x = J = 1 σ2(t)Cov[mt|x] This theorem shows us that the multiplication by ∂ˆxt ∂x in Eq (7) is in fact a transformation by the covariance matrix Cov[mt|x]. Multiplying a vector by Cov[mt|x] stretches the vector along the principal directions of the conditional distribution p(mt|x). Intuitively, since the conditional distribution p(mt|x) corresponds to the distribution of candidate denoised images, the principal directions of variation are perceptually aligned (to demonstrate, we apply SVD to J and visualise the principal components in Appendix B.8) and hence stretching the gradient along these directions will yield perceptually aligned gradients. We note that our derivation complements Proposition 1 in Chung et al. [9] which proves certain properties (e.g., J = J⊤) of this derivative. In practice, however, the score-function is parameterized by unconstrained, flexible neural architectures that do not have exactly symmetric jacobian matrices J. For more details on techniques to enforce conservative properties of score-functions, we refer the reader to Chao et al. [7]. Ganz et al. [16] demonstrate that training a classifier to have perceptually aligned gradients also improves its robustness exposing the bidirectional relationship between robustness and PAGs. This works offers additional evidence supporting the co-occurrence of robustness and PAGs since we observe that classification of diffused-and-denoised images (e.g., DDS, DE, DDA) not only improve robustness but also produce PAGs. Ablation Analysis. Appendix B.5 includes an ablation study on the following: (a) Extra Training: The pretrained DA, AM, and DAM classifiers are sufficiently trained for 180 epochs and hence, we compare the DiffAug finetuned model directly with the pretrained checkpoint. For completeness, we train AugMix for another 10 epochs and confirm that there is no notable change in performance as compared to results in Tables 1, 2 and 6. (b) DiffAug Hyperparameters In our experiments, we considered the complete range of diffusion time. We investigate a simple variation where we either use t ∈ [0, 500] or t ∈ [500, 999] to generate the DiffAug augmentations. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble Hyperparameters We analyse how the choice of diffusion times considered in the set S (Eq. (6)) affects DE performance. 5 Experiments II: Classifier-Guided Diffusion Classifier guided (CG) diffusion is a conditional generation technique to generate class-conditional samples with an unconditional diffusion model. To achieve this, a time-conditional classifier is separately trained to classify noisy samples from the forward diffusion and we refer to this as a guidance classifier LCE = Et,x[−log pϕ(y|x, t)] (8) where, t ∼ U(0, T), x ∼ pt(x|x0) and (x0, y) ∼ p0(x). At each step of the classifier-guided reverse diffusion (Eq. (2)), the guidance classifier is used to compute the class-conditional score ∇x log pt(x|y) =∇x log pϕ(y|x, t) +λs∇x log pt(x) (λs is classifier scale[13]), which is used in place of unconditional score ∇x log pt(x). Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier. The guidance classifiers participate in the sampling through their gradients, which indicate the pixel-wise perturbations that maximizes log-likelihood of the target class. Perceptually aligned gradients that resemble images from data distribution lead to meaningful pixel-wise perturbations that could potentially improve classifier-guidance and forms the motivation of Kawar et al. [27], where they propose an adversarial training recipe for guidance classifiers. With 7(a) PAG: Noisy-classifer vs DA-Classifier  (b) Generated Samples: Noisy-Classifier vs DA-Classifier Figure 4: (a) Min-max normalized gradients on clean samples (left column) diffused to t = 300 (T = 999). For easy comparison between Noisy classifier gradients (middle column) and DA-classifier gradients (right column), we applied an identical enhancement to both images, i.e. contrast maximization. The unedited gradients are shown in Fig. 16. (b) Qualitative Comparison of Guidance Classifiers on the Image Generation Task using DDIM-100 with same random seed. In each pair, the first image is generated with the Noisy Classifier and the second image is generated with the Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier. We observe that the Denoising- Augmented (DA) Classifier improves overall coherence as compared to the Noisy Classifier. Also see Fig. 21 in appendix for more examples. the same motivation, we instead build on Theorem 4.1 in order to improve perceptual alignment and propose to train guidance classifiers with denoised examples ˆxt derived from x. While the obvious choice is to simply train the guidance-classifier onˆxt instead of x, we choose to provide bothx as well as ˆxt as simultaneous inputs to the classifier and instead optimize LCE = Et,x[−log pϕ(y|x, ˆxt, t)] (compare with Eq. (8)). We preserve the noisy input since the primary goal of guidance classifiers is to classify noisy examples and this approach enables the model to flexibly utilize information from both inputs. We refer to guidance-classifiers trained using both x and ˆxt as denoising-augmented (DA) classifier and use noisy classifiers to refer to guidance-classifiers trained exclusively on x. Experiment setup. We conduct our experiments on CIFAR10 and Imagenet and evaluate the advantages of DA-Classifiers over noisy classifiers. While we use the same Imagenet diffusion model described in Section 4, we use the deep NCSN++ (continuous) model released by Song et al. [43] as the score-network for CIFAR10 (VE-Diffusion). As compared to the noisy classifier, the DA-classifier has an additional input-convolution layer to process the denoised input and is identical from the second layer onwards. We describe our classifier architectures and the training details in Appendix C.1. Table 3: Summary of Test Accura- cies for CIFAR10 and Imagenet: each test example is diffused to a random uniformly sampled dif- fusion time. Both classifiers are shown the same diffused example. Method CIFAR10 Imagenet Noisy Classifier 54.79 33.78 DA-Classifier 57.16 36.11 Classification Accuracy. We first compare guidance classifiers in terms of test accuracies as a measure of their generalization (Table 3) and find that DA-classifiers generalize better to the test data. Training classifiers with Gaussian perturbed examples often leads to under- fitting [54] explaining the lower test accuracy observed with noisy classifiers. Interestingly, the additional denoised example helps ad- dress the underfitting – for example, see Fig. 15 (in appendix). One explanation of this finding could be found in Chung et al. [9], where they distinguish between noisy examples and their corresponding denoised examples as being in the ambient space and on the image manifold respectively, under certain assumptions. To determine the relative importance of noisy and denoised examples in DA-classifiers, we zeroed out one of the input images to the CIFAR10 classifier and measured classification accuracies: while zeroing the noisy input caused the average accuracy across all time-scales to drop to 50.1%, zeroing the denoised input breaks the classifier completely yielding random predictions. Classifier Gradients. In Fig. 4a, we qualitatively compare between the noisy classifier gradients (∇x log pϕ(y|x, t)) and the DA-classifier gradients(∇x log pϕ(y|x, ˆx, t)). We find that the gradients obtained from the DA-classifier are more structured and semantically aligned with the clean image as compared to the ones obtained with the noisy classifier (see Figs. 16 and 18 in Appendix for more examples). Gradients backpropagated through the denoising score network have been previously utilized (e.g., [3, 9, 10, 17, 25, 33]), but our work is the first to observe and analyze the qualitative 8Table 4: Quantitative comparison of Guidance Classifiers on the Image Generation Task using 50k samples. We also show unconditional precision/recall (P/R) and the average class-conditional ePrecision/eRecall/eDensity/eCoverage.

Image Generation. To evaluate the guidance classifiers in terms of their image generation, we generate 50k images each – see Appendix C.2 for details on the sampling parameters. We com- pare the classifiers in terms of standard generative modeling metrics such as FID, IS, and P/R/D/C (Precision/Recall/Density/Coverage). The P/R/D/C metrics compare between the manifold of gen- erated distribution and manifold of the source distribution in terms of nearest-neighbours and can be computed conditionally (i.e., classwise) or unconditionally. Following standard practice, we additionally evaluate CIFAR10 classifiers on class-conditional P/R/D/C. Our results (Table 4) show that our proposed Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier improves upon the Noisy Classifier in terms of FID and IS for both CIFAR10 and Imagenet at roughly same Precision and Recall levels (see Appendix C.3 for comparison with baselines). Our evaluation of average class-conditional precision, recall, density and coverage for each CIFAR10 class also shows that DA-classifiers outperform Noisy classifiers: for example, DA-classifiers yield classwise density and coverage of about 0.92 and 0.77 respectively on average as compared to 0.78 and 0.71 obtained with Noisy-Classifiers. We can attribute our improvements in the class-conditional precision, recall, density and coverage to the improved generalization of DA-classifier. To qualitatively analyse benefits of the DA-classifier, we generated Imagenet samples using DDIM-100 sampler with identical random seeds and λs = 2.5. In our resulting analysis, we consistently observed that the DA-classifier maintains more coherent fore- ground and background as compared to the Noisy Classifier. We show examples in Fig. 4b. Overall, we attribute improved image generation to the improved generalization and classifier gradients. 6 Related Works Synthetic Augmentation with Diffusion Models have also been explored to train semi-supervised classifiers [50] and few-shot learning [47]. Other studies on training classifiers with synthetic datasets generated with a text2image diffusion model include [4, 21, 51]. Apart from being computationally expensive, such text2image diffusion models are trained on large-scale upstream datasets and some of the reported improvements could also be attributed to the quality of the upstream dataset. Instead, we propose a efficient diffusion-based augmentation method and report improvements using a diffusion model trained with no extra data. In principle, DiffAug is complementary to synthetic training data generated with text2image diffusion models and we leave further analysis as future work. Diffusion Models for Robust Classification. Diffusion-classifier [29] is a method for zero-shot classification but also improves robustness to covariate shifts. Diff-TTA[35] is a test-time adaptation technique to update the classifier parameters at test time and is complementary to classifier training techniques such as DiffAug. In terms of OOD detection, previous works have proposed reconstruction- based metrics for ood detection [ 19, 30]. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate improved OOD detection on Imagenet using diffusion models. 7 Conclusion In this work, we introduce DiffAug to train robust classifiers with one-step diffusion denoised examples. The simplicity and computational efficiency of DiffAug enables us to also extend other data augmentation techniques, where we find that DiffAug confers additional robustness without affecting accuracy on clean examples. We qualitatively analyse DiffAug samples in an attempt to explain improved robustness. Furthermore, we extend DiffAug to test time and introduce an efficient test-time image adaptation technique to further improve robustness to covariate shifts. Finally, we 9theoretically analyse perceptually aligned gradients in denoised examples and use this to improve classifier-guided diffusion.

Limitations and Future Work In this work, we introduced DiffAug, a simple diffusion-based augmentation technique to improve classifier robustness. While we presented a unified training scheme, we follow previous works and evaluate robustness to covariate shifts, adversarial examples and out-of-distribution detection using separate evaluation pipelines (for e.g., we do not apply DDA on OOD examples). A unified evaluation pipeline for classifier robustness is an open problem and out of scope for this paper. The key advantage of our method is its computational efficiency since it requires just one reverse diffusion step to generate the augmentations; however, this is computationally more expensive than handcrafted augmentation techniques such as AugMix. Nevertheless, it is fast enough that we can generate the augmentations online during each training step. With recent advances in distilling diffusion models for fast sampling [31] such as Consistency-Models [44], it may be possible to generate better quality synthetic examples within the training loop. Since the improved robustness introduced by DiffAug can be attributed to the augmentations of varying image quality (Fig. 1), we believe that 12this complementary regularization effect can still be valuable with efficient high-quality sampling and leave further exploration to future work. Likewise, DiffAug is complementary to the use of additional synthetic data generated offline with text2image diffusion models and the extension of DiffAug to text2image diffusion models is suitable for future investigation. We also extend DiffAug to test time and propose DE, wherein we demonstrate improvements comparable to DDA at 10x wallclock time on all classifiers except ViT on Imagenet-C; while this demonstrates a limitation of single-step denoising (i.e., DE) vs. multi-step denoising(i.e., DDA), we also note that DE improves over DDA for all classifiers when considering Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S. While we demonstrate improvements over existing baselines of classifier-guidance (e.g., [6, 27, 53]), we do not compare with classifier-free guidance [24], the popular guidance method, since our primary focus is on the training of robust classifiers with DiffAug and demonstrating the potential of DiffAug. Training classifier-guided diffusion models for careful comparison requires additional computational resources and we leave this analysis to future work. Nevertheless, classifier-guidance is a computationally attractive alternative to perform conditional generation since this allows flexible reuse of a pretrained diffusion model for different class-definitions by separately training a small classifier model. We also note that computing classifier-gradients is slower for DA-classifiers as compared to noisy classifiers since it requires backpropagating through the score-network and shares this limitation with other recent works that utilize intermediate denoised examples for guidance (e.g., Bansal et al. [3], Chung et al. [9, 10], Ho et al. [25]) – the recent advances in efficient diffusion sampling could be extended to class-conditional sampling to reduce the gap. Compute Resources For this paper, we had access to 8 40GB A40 GPUs to conduct our training and evaluation. We used a maximum of 4 GPUs for each job and the longest training job was the 90-epoch RN-50 training followed by the 20-epoch ViT training. The evaluation of classifiers on Imagenet-C, Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S using DE and Default evaluation modes are fairly fast. However, generating DDA examples for the entire Imagenet-C dataset and Imagenet-test dataset is computationally expensive and takes up to a week (even while using 8 GPUs in parallel) and also requires sufficient storage capacity to save the DDA-transformed images. Likewise, evaluation of certified accuracy with DDS is also computationally expensive since it uses 10k noise samples per example to estimate the certified radius and prediction. Training CIFAR10 guidance classifiers are fairly efficient while finetuning the Imagenet guidance classifier can take up to 3 days depending on the gradient accumulation parameter (i.e., number of GPUs available) – when available, we used a maximum of 4 GPUs. On average, the 50k CIFAR10 and Imagenet images that we sample for evaluation of guidance classifiers can be done within a maximum of 36 hours depending on how we parallelize the generation. Broader Impact The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new augmentation method using diffusion models to improve classifier robustness. With increasing deployment of deep learning models in real-world settings, improved robustness is crucial to enable safe and trustworthy deployment. Since we demonstrate potential of diffusion models trained with no extra data as compared to the classifier, we anticipate that this will be useful in applications where such extra data is not easily available (e.g., medical imaging). We also extend this method to improve classifier-guided diffusion. Improvements in classifier-guided diffusion can be used in developing a myriad downstream applications, each with their own potential balance of positive and negative impacts. Leveraging and re-using a pre-trained model amplifies the importance of giving proper consideration to copyright issues associated with the data on which that model was trained. While our proposed model has the potential for generating deep-fakes or disinformation, these technologies also hold promise for positive applications, including creativity-support tools and design aids in engineering. 13A Appendix for Section 3 Figure 5: A demonstration of the DiffAug technique using a Toy 2D dataset. Figure 6: A zoomed-in view demonstrating the transformation considering a single train point. Original  Color Augmented Manifold Intrusion from Color Augmentation Figure 7: Example of Manifold Intrusion from Appendix C of Hendrycks et al. [23]. While DiffAug may alter class labels (Fig. 1), the denoised images are visually distinguishable from the original images allowing the model to also learn from noisy labels without inducing manifold intrusion. On the other hand, here is an example of manifold intrusion where the augmented image does not contain any visual cues that enable the model to be robust to noisy labels. B Appendix for Section 4 B.1 Training Details In the following, we describe the training details for the classifiers we evaluated in Section 4. In general, we optimize a sum of two losses: LTotal = 0.5 ∗ (LOrig + L) where, LOrig is the classification objective on the original augmentation policy that we aim to improve using DiffAug examples and L denotes the classification objective measured on DiffAug examples (Eq. (5)). Before applying 14DiffAug, we first resized the raw image such that at least one of the edges is of size 256 and then use a 224 × 224 center-crop as the test image since the diffusion model was not trained on random resized crops. • RN-50: We trained the model from scratch for 90 epochs using the same optimization hyperparameters used to train the official PyTorch RN-50 checkpoint. • ViT: We used the two-stage training recipe proposed in DeIT-III. In particular, the training recipe consists of an 800-epoch supervised pretraining at a lower resolution (e.g., 192×192) followed by a 20-epoch finetuning at the target resolution (e.g., 224×224). Starting with the pretrained checkpoint (i.e., after 800 epochs), we finetune the classifier exactly following the prescribed optimization and augmentation hyperparameters (e.g., AutoAugment (AA) parameters and MixUp/CutMix parameters) except that we also consider DiffAug examples. We also included DiffAug examples when applying MixUp/CutMix since we observed significant drops in standard test accuracies when training directly on DiffAug examples without label-smoothing or MixUp. We briefly explored stacking DiffAug with AA and identified that this did not introduce any noticeable change as compared to independent application of DiffAug and AA to train examples. • AugMix/DeepAugment/DeepAugment+AugMix: To evaluate the combination of DiffAug with these augmentations, we finetune the RN-50 checkpoint opensourced by the respective papers for 10 epochs with a batch-size of 256. We resume the training with the optimizer state made available along with the model weights and use a constant learning rate of 1e-6. B.2 More Results on Covariate Shift Robustness Table 5: ImageNet-C (severity=5) accuracy for each corruption type. Relative Improvements when additionally using diffusion denoised augmentations are computed with respect to the corresponding pretrained checkpoints and averaged across all corruption types. Overall, we observe improvements for each family of corruptions: in the default evaluation mode, we observe an average absolute improvement of 2.5%, 4.9%,1.0% and 0.76% for the Noise, Blur, Weather and Digital corruptions respectively. Across all evaluation modes, we observe an average absolute improvement of 1.86%, 4.74%, 1.67%, 1.51% for the Noise, Blur, Weather and Digital corruptions respectively.

The AUROC is a threshold-free evaluation of OOD detection while FPR@TPR95 measures the false positive rate at which OOD samples are incorrectly identified as in-distribution samples given that the true positive rate of detecting in-distribution samples correctly is 95%. The Near-OOD Imagenet task as defined by OpenOOD consists of SSB-Hard and NINCO datasets and we also include the performance for each dataset in the following tables. 0 200 400 600 800 t 0 2 4 6Entropy (nats) Maximum Entropy ViT ViT+DiffAug RN50 RN50+DiffAug Figure 9: The entropy plots for ViT and RN50 are shown where we observe similar trends as in Fig. 2.

Here, we observe comparable performance although we notice slight improvements in detection rates. We do not show the results for other OOD algorithms since we found those results to be significantly worse than simple MSP. This may be because the OOD research is mainly focused on deep convolution architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet. Train Augmentation AUROC FPR95 SSB-Hard NINCO Avg. SSB-Hard NINCO Avg.

B.5.1 Extra Training We train the pretrained AugMix checkpoint for extra 10 epochs to isolate the improvement obtained by DiffAug finetuning. In Table 13, we analyse the OOD detection performance as well as the robustness to covariate shift (Imagenet-C, Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S) finding no notable difference as compared to the results in Tables 1, 2 and 6. B.5.2 DiffAug Hyperparameters The time range used to generate the DiffAug train augmentations constitutes the key hyperparameter and we analyse and compare between weaker DiffAug augmentations (t ∈ [0, 500]) and stronger DiffAug augmentations (t ∈ [500, 999]). From Table 13, we find that both weak and strong DiffAug augmentations complement each other and contribute to different aspects of robustness. Overall, using the entire diffusion time range to generate DiffAug yields consistent improvements. 18Table 13: Ablation Analysis. (a) Top-1 Accuracy(%) on ImageNet-C (severity=5) and ImageNet-Test. We observe that extra AugMix training does not introduce any remarkable difference with respect to the pretrained checkpoint allowing us to clearly attribute the improved robustness to DiffAug. Further, we also analyse the choice of diffusion time-range for generating the DiffAug augmentations and find that the stronger DiffAug augmentations generated with t ∈ [500, 999] enhances robustness to Imagenet-C as compared to DiffAug [0, 500] while obtaining slightly lower accuracy on Imagenet-Test in DE and DDA evaluation modes. Using the entire diffusion time-scale tends to achieve the right balance between both. ImageNet-C (severity = 5) ImageNet-Test Train Augmentations DDA DDA (SE) DE Def. Avg DDA DDA (SE) DE Def.

B.7 Derivation of Theorem 4.1 For the forward-diffusion SDEs considered in this paper, the marginal distribution pt(x) can be expressed in terms of the data distribution p(x0): pt(x) = Z x0 pt(x|x0)p(x0)dx0 (9) where pt(x|x0) =N(x | µ(x0, t), σ2(t)I). If we denote µ(x0, t) by mt, we can rewrite pt(x) as pt(x) = Z mt pt(x|mt)p(mt)dmt since µ is linear and invertible. The optimal score-functionsθ∗(x, t) =∇x log pt(x) can be simplified as: sθ∗(x, t) = 1 pt(x) Z mt mt − x σ2(t) pt(x|mt) p(mt)dmt (10) 20Figure 12: CIFAR10 examples used for SVD Analysis Using Eq (10), we can rewrite the denoised example, ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t), as: ˆxt = 1 pt(x) Z mt mt pt(x|mt) p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt = E[mt|x] (11) That is, the denoised example ˆxt is in fact the expected value of the mean mt given input x. (See also Eq (4) in the main text ). To compute ∂ˆxt ∂x , we algebraically simplify R mt mt∇x \u0010 pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0011 p(mt)dmt as follows: ∂ˆxt ∂x = Z mt mt \u0012∇xpt(x|mt) pt(x) − pt(x|mt)∇xpt(x) p2 t (x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt \u0012pt(x|mt) pt(x) mt − x σ2(t) − pt(x|mt)∇x log pt(x) pt(x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012mt − x σ2(t) − ∇x log pt(x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012mt − x − σ2(t)∇x log pt(x) σ2(t) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012 mt σ2(t) − x + σ2(t)∇x log pt(x) σ2(t) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mtm⊤ t σ2(t) pt(mt|x)dmt − \u0012Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt \u0013 ˆx⊤ t σ2(t) = 1 σ2(t) \u0012Z mt mtm⊤ t pt(mt|x)dmt − ˆxtˆx⊤ t \u0013 = 1 σ2(t) \u0000 E[mtm⊤ t |x] − E[mt|x]E[mt|x]⊤\u0001 = 1 σ2(t)Cov[mt|x] (12) B.8 Analysis with SVD Decomposition Considering the CIFAR10 images in Fig. 12, we compute the 3072×3072 jacobian matrix J and then apply SVD decomposition J = USV using default settings in PyTorch. Then, we visualise — after min-max normalization — the columns of U and rows of V along with the (batch-averaged) value in the diagonal matrix S of the corresponding row/column. We find that the principal components of the jacobian matrix are perceptually aligned and provides additional intuition for Theorem 4.1.

C.1 Guidance Classifier Training: Experiment Details We use the pretrained noisy Imagenet classifier released by Dhariwal and Nichol [13] while we trained the noisy CIFAR10 classifier ourselves; the Imagenet classifier is the downsampling half of the UNET with attention pooling classifier-head while we use WideResNet-28-2 as the architecture for CIFAR10. For the DA-classifier, we simply add an extra convolution that can process the denoised input: for Imagenet, we finetune the pretrained noisy classifier by adding an additional input-convolution module while we train the denoising-augmented CIFAR10 classifier from scratch. The details of the optimization are as follows: (1) for Imagenet, we fine-tune the entire network along with the new convolution-module (initialized with very small weights) using AdamW optimizer with a learning-rate of 1e-5 and a weight-decay of 0.05 for 50k steps with a batch size of 128. (2) For CIFAR10, we train both noisy and DA-classifiers for 150k steps with a batch size of 512 using AdamW optimizer with a learning-rate of 3e-4 and weight decay of 0.05. For CIFAR10 classifiers, we use the Exponential Moving Average of the parameters with decay-rate equal to 0.999. 24Figure 16: Min-max normalized gradients on samples diffused to t = 300 (T = 999). Top panel: gradients obtained with noisy classifier. Bottom panel: gradients obtained with DA-classifier. Middle panel: corresponding clean Imagenet samples. We recommend zooming in to see differences between gradients, e.g. the clearer coherence in DA-classifier gradients. C.2 Classifier-Guided Diffusion: Sampling We use a PC sampler as described in Song et al. [43] with 1000 discretization steps for CIFAR10 samples while we use a DDIM [42] sampler with 25 discretization steps for Imagenet samples. We use the 256x256 class-conditional diffusion model open-sourced by Dhariwal and Nichol [12] for our Imagenet experiments and set the classifier scale λs = 2.5 following their experimental setup for DDIM-25 samples. The classifier-scale is set to 1.0 for CIFAR10 experiments. 25Figure 17: The figure shows the total derivative dlog pϕ(y|x,ˆxt,t) dx = ∂log pϕ ∂x + ∂log pϕ ∂ˆxt ∂ˆxt ∂x , the partial derivative with respect to noisy input ∂ log pϕ ∂x , the partial derivative with respect to denoised input ∂ log pϕ ∂ˆx , and ∂ log pϕ ∂ˆx ∂ˆxt ∂x .

Since Chao et al. [6] use ResNet18 backbones for their CIFAR10 experiments, we train a separate DA- Classifier for these comparisons. We compare between FID, IS and also compare the unconditional precision and recall (P/R) and the average class-conditional ePrecision/eRecall/eDensity/eCoverage.We obtain our results for Noisy Classifier (CE) and Noisy Classifier (DLSM) from Table 2 of Chao et al. [6]. While the FID and IS scores are comparable, we note that our class-wise Precision, Recall, Density and Coverage metrics are either comparable or demonstrate a significant improvement.

[53] propose two complementary techniques to improve over vanilla classifier-guidance: Entropy-Constraint Training (ECT) and Entropy-Driven Sampling (EDS). ECT consists of adding an additional loss term to the cross-entropy loss encouraging the predictions to be closer to uniform distribution (similar to the label-smoothing loss). EDS modifies the sampling to use a diffusion-time dependent scaling factor designed to address premature vanishing guidance-gradients. The sampling method (EDS/Vanilla) can be chosen independent of the training method (determined by the loss-objective and classifier-inputs). In the following, we compare between ECT and DA-Classifiers using Vanilla Sampling method using the results in Table 3 of Zheng et al.[53]. As the robust-classifier [27] was not evaluated for Imagenet-256, we fine-tuned the open-source checkpoint using the open-source code provided by robust-guidance for 50k steps with learning rate=1e-5 We observe that DA-Classifier obtains better FID/IS than both ECT and Robust-Guidance.

Introduction Historically, probabilistic models suffer from a tradeoff be- tween two conﬂicting objectives: tractability and ﬂexibil- ity. Models that are tractable can be analytically evaluated and easily ﬁt to data (e.g. a Gaussian or Laplace). However, Proceedings of the 32 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copy- right 2015 by the author(s). these models are unable to aptly describe structure in rich datasets. On the other hand, models that are ﬂexible can be molded to ﬁt structure in arbitrary data. For example, we can deﬁne models in terms of any (non-negative) function φ(x) yielding the ﬂexible distribution p(x) = φ(x) Z , where Z is a normalization constant. However, computing this normalization constant is generally intractable. Evaluating, training, or drawing samples from such ﬂexible models typ- ically requires a very expensive Monte Carlo process. A variety of analytic approximations exist which amelio- rate, but do not remove, this tradeoff–for instance mean ﬁeld theory and its expansions (T, 1982; Tanaka, 1998), variational Bayes (Jordan et al., 1999), contrastive diver- gence (Welling & Hinton, 2002; Hinton, 2002), minimum probability ﬂow (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2011b;a), minimum KL contraction (Lyu, 2011), proper scoring rules (Gneit- ing & Raftery, 2007; Parry et al., 2012), score matching (Hyv¨arinen, 2005), pseudolikelihood (Besag, 1975), loopy belief propagation (Murphy et al., 1999), and many, many more. Non-parametric methods (Gershman & Blei, 2012) can also be very effective1. 1.1. Diffusion probabilistic models We present a novel way to deﬁne probabilistic models that allows: 1. extreme ﬂexibility in model structure, 2. exact sampling, 1Non-parametric methods can be seen as transitioning smoothly between tractable and ﬂexible models. For instance, a non-parametric Gaussian mixture model will represent a small amount of data using a single Gaussian, but may represent inﬁnite data as a mixture of an inﬁnite number of Gaussians. arXiv:1503.03585v8  [cs.LG]  18 Nov 2015Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics 3. easy multiplication with other distributions, e.g. in or- der to compute a posterior, and 4. the model log likelihood, and the probability of indi- vidual states, to be cheaply evaluated. Our method uses a Markov chain to gradually convert one distribution into another, an idea used in non-equilibrium statistical physics (Jarzynski, 1997) and sequential Monte Carlo (Neal, 2001). We build a generative Markov chain which converts a simple known distribution (e.g. a Gaus- sian) into a target (data) distribution using a diffusion pro- cess. Rather than use this Markov chain to approximately evaluate a model which has been otherwise deﬁned, we ex- plicitly deﬁne the probabilistic model as the endpoint of the Markov chain. Since each step in the diffusion chain has an analytically evaluable probability, the full chain can also be analytically evaluated. Learning in this framework involves estimating small per- turbations to a diffusion process. Estimating small pertur- bations is more tractable than explicitly describing the full distribution with a single, non-analytically-normalizable, potential function. Furthermore, since a diffusion process exists for any smooth target distribution, this method can capture data distributions of arbitrary form. We demonstrate the utility of these diffusion probabilistic models by training high log likelihood models for a two- dimensional swiss roll, binary sequence, handwritten digit (MNIST), and several natural image (CIFAR-10, bark, and dead leaves) datasets. 1.2. Relationship to other work The wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton, 1995; Dayan et al., 1995) introduced the idea of training inference and gen- erative probabilistic models against each other. This approach remained largely unexplored for nearly two decades, though with some exceptions (Sminchisescu et al., 2006; Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010). There has been a re- cent explosion of work developing this idea. In (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Gregor et al., 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Ozair & Bengio, 2014) variational learning and inference algorithms were developed which allow a ﬂexible genera- tive model and posterior distribution over latent variables to be directly trained against each other. The variational bound in these papers is similar to the one used in our training objective and in the earlier work of (Sminchisescu et al., 2006). However, our motivation and model form are both quite different, and the present work retains the following differences and advantages relative to these techniques: 1. We develop our framework using ideas from physics, quasi-static processes, and annealed importance sam- pling rather than from variational Bayesian methods. 2. We show how to easily multiply the learned distribu- tion with another probability distribution (eg with a conditional distribution in order to compute a poste- rior) 3. We address the difﬁculty that training the inference model can prove particularly challenging in varia- tional inference methods, due to the asymmetry in the objective between the inference and generative mod- els. We restrict the forward (inference) process to a simple functional form, in such a way that the re- verse (generative) process will have the same func- tional form. 4. We train models with thousands of layers (or time steps), rather than only a handful of layers. 5. We provide upper and lower bounds on the entropy production in each layer (or time step) There are a number of related techniques for training prob- abilistic models (summarized below) that develop highly ﬂexible forms for generative models, train stochastic tra- jectories, or learn the reversal of a Bayesian network. Reweighted wake-sleep (Bornschein & Bengio, 2015) de- velops extensions and improved learning rules for the orig- inal wake-sleep algorithm. Generative stochastic networks (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013; Yao et al., 2014) train a Markov kernel to match its equilibrium distribution to the data distribution. Neural autoregressive distribution estimators (Larochelle & Murray, 2011) (and their recur- rent (Uria et al., 2013a) and deep (Uria et al., 2013b) ex- tensions) decompose a joint distribution into a sequence of tractable conditional distributions over each dimension. Adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) train a gen- erative model against a classiﬁer which attempts to dis- tinguish generated samples from true data. A similar ob- jective in (Schmidhuber, 1992) learns a two-way map- ping to a representation with marginally independent units. In (Rippel & Adams, 2013; Dinh et al., 2014) bijective deterministic maps are learned to a latent representation with a simple factorial density function. In (Stuhlm ¨uller et al., 2013) stochastic inverses are learned for Bayesian networks. Mixtures of conditional Gaussian scale mix- tures (MCGSMs) (Theis et al., 2012) describe a dataset using Gaussian scale mixtures, with parameters which de- pend on a sequence of causal neighborhoods. There is additionally signiﬁcant work learning ﬂexible generative mappings from simple latent distributions to data distribu- tions – early examples including (MacKay, 1995) where neural networks are introduced as generative models, and (Bishop et al., 1998) where a stochastic manifold mapping is learned from a latent space to the data space. We will compare experimentally against adversarial networks and MCGSMs. Related ideas from physics include the Jarzynski equal- ity (Jarzynski, 1997), known in machine learning as An-Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics t= 0 t= T 2 t= T q ( x(0···T)) 2  0 2 2 0 2 2  0 2 2 0 2 2  0 2 2 0 2 p ( x(0···T)) 2  0 2 2 0 2 2  0 2 2 0 2 2  0 2 2 0 2 fµ ( x(t),t ) −x(t) Figure 1.

In (Burda et al., 2014) it is shown that AIS can also be performed using the reverse rather than forward trajec- tory. Langevin dynamics (Langevin, 1908), which are the stochastic realization of the Fokker-Planck equation, show how to deﬁne a Gaussian diffusion process which has any target distribution as its equilibrium. In (Suykens & Vande- walle, 1995) the Fokker-Planck equation is used to perform stochastic optimization. Finally, the Kolmogorov forward and backward equations (Feller, 1949) show that for many forward diffusion processes, the reverse diffusion processes can be described using the same functional form. 2. Algorithm Our goal is to deﬁne a forward (or inference) diffusion pro- cess which converts any complex data distribution into a simple, tractable, distribution, and then learn a ﬁnite-time reversal of this diffusion process which deﬁnes our gener- ative model distribution (See Figure 1). We ﬁrst describe the forward, inference diffusion process. We then show how the reverse, generative diffusion process can be trained and used to evaluate probabilities. We also derive entropy bounds for the reverse process, and show how the learned distributions can be multiplied by any second distribution (e.g. as would be done to compute a posterior when in- painting or denoising an image). 2.1. Forward Trajectory We label the data distribution q ( x(0)) . The data distribu- tion is gradually converted into a well behaved (analyti- cally tractable) distribution π(y) by repeated application of a Markov diffusion kernel Tπ(y|y′; β) for π(y), where βis the diffusion rate, π(y) = ∫ dy′Tπ(y|y′; β) π(y′) (1) q ( x(t)|x(t−1) ) = Tπ ( x(t)|x(t−1); βt ) .

Binary sequence learning via binomial diffusion. A binomial diffusion model was trained on binary ‘heartbeat’ data, where a pulse occurs every 5th bin. Generated samples (left) are identical to the training data. The sampling procedure consists of initialization at independent binomial noise (right), which is then transformed into the data distribution by a binomial diffusion process, with trained bit ﬂip probabilities. Each row contains an independent sample. For ease of visualization, all samples have been shifted so that a pulse occurs in the ﬁrst column. In the raw sequence data, the ﬁrst pulse is uniformly distributed over the ﬁrst ﬁve bins. (a)  (b) (c)  (d) Figure 3.

(b) Holdout data corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance 1 (SNR = 1). (c) Denoised images, generated by sampling from the posterior distribution over denoised images conditioned on the images in (b). (d) Samples generated by the diffusion model. The forward trajectory, corresponding to starting at the data distribution and performing T steps of diffusion, is thus q ( x(0···T) ) = q ( x(0) ) T∏ t=1 q ( x(t)|x(t−1) ) (3) For the experiments shown below, q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) corre- sponds to either Gaussian diffusion into a Gaussian distri- bution with identity-covariance, or binomial diffusion into an independent binomial distribution. Table App.1 gives the diffusion kernels for both Gaussian and binomial distri- butions.Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics 2.2. Reverse Trajectory The generative distribution will be trained to describe the same trajectory, but in reverse, p ( x(T) ) = π ( x(T) ) (4) p ( x(0···T) ) = p ( x(T) ) T∏ t=1 p ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) . (5) For both Gaussian and binomial diffusion, for continuous diffusion (limit of small step size β) the reversal of the diffusion process has the identical functional form as the forward process (Feller, 1949). Since q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) is a Gaussian (binomial) distribution, and if βt is small, then q ( x(t−1)|x(t)) will also be a Gaussian (binomial) distribu- tion. The longer the trajectory the smaller the diffusion rate βcan be made. During learning only the mean and covariance for a Gaus- sian diffusion kernel, or the bit ﬂip probability for a bi- nomial kernel, need be estimated. As shown in Table App.1, fµ ( x(t),t ) and fΣ ( x(t),t ) are functions deﬁning the mean and covariance of the reverse Markov transitions for a Gaussian, and fb ( x(t),t ) is a function providing the bit ﬂip probability for a binomial distribution. The compu- tational cost of running this algorithm is the cost of these functions, times the number of time-steps. For all results in this paper, multi-layer perceptrons are used to deﬁne these functions. A wide range of regression or function ﬁtting techniques would be applicable however, including nonpa- rameteric methods. 2.3. Model Probability The probability the generative model assigns to the data is p ( x(0) ) = ∫ dx(1···T)p ( x(0···T) ) . (6) Naively this integral is intractable – but taking a cue from annealed importance sampling and the Jarzynski equality, we instead evaluate the relative probability of the forward and reverse trajectories, averaged over forward trajectories, p ( x(0) ) = ∫ dx(1···T)p ( x(0···T) )q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) (7) = ∫ dx(1···T)q ( x(1···T)|x(0) ) p ( x(0···T)) q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) (8) = ∫ dx(1···T)q ( x(1···T)|x(0) ) · p ( x(T) ) T∏ t=1 p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)). (9) This can be evaluated rapidly by averaging over samples from the forward trajectory q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) . For inﬁnites- imal β the forward and reverse distribution over trajecto- ries can be made identical (see Section 2.2). If they are identical then only a single sample from q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) is required to exactly evaluate the above integral, as can be seen by substitution. This corresponds to the case of a quasi-static process in statistical physics (Spinney & Ford, 2013; Jarzynski, 2011). 2.4. Training Training amounts to maximizing the model log likelihood, L= ∫ dx(0)q ( x(0) ) log p ( x(0) ) (10) = ∫ dx(0)q ( x(0) ) · log   ∫ dx(1···T)q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) · p ( x(T))∏T t=1 p(x(t−1)|x(t)) q(x(t)|x(t−1))  , (11) which has a lower bound provided by Jensen’s inequality, L≥ ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) · log [ p ( x(T) ) T∏ t=1 p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] . (12) As described in Appendix B, for our diffusion trajectories this reduces to, L≥K (13) K = − T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0)dx(t)q ( x(0),x(t) ) · DKL ( q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0) )⏐⏐⏐ ⏐⏐⏐p ( x(t−1)|x(t) )) + Hq ( X(T)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(1)|X(0) ) −Hp ( X(T) ) . (14) where the entropies and KL divergences can be analyt- ically computed. The derivation of this bound parallels the derivation of the log likelihood bound in variational Bayesian methods. As in Section 2.3 if the forward and reverse trajectories are identical, corresponding to a quasi-static process, then the inequality in Equation 13 becomes an equality. Training consists of ﬁnding the reverse Markov transitions which maximize this lower bound on the log likelihood, ˆp ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) = argmax p(x(t−1)|x(t)) K. (15)Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics The speciﬁc targets of estimation for Gaussian and bino- mial diffusion are given in Table App.1. Thus, the task of estimating a probability distribution has been reduced to the task of performing regression on the functions which set the mean and covariance of a sequence of Gaussians (or set the state ﬂip probability for a sequence of Bernoulli trials). 2.4.1. S ETTING THE DIFFUSION RATE βt The choice of βt in the forward trajectory is important for the performance of the trained model. In AIS, the right schedule of intermediate distributions can greatly improve the accuracy of the log partition function estimate (Grosse et al., 2013). In thermodynamics the schedule taken when moving between equilibrium distributions determines how much free energy is lost (Spinney & Ford, 2013; Jarzynski, 2011). In the case of Gaussian diffusion, we learn 2 the forward diffusion schedule β2···T by gradient ascent on K. The variance β1 of the ﬁrst step is ﬁxed to a small constant to prevent overﬁtting. The dependence of samples from q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) on β1···T is made explicit by using ‘frozen noise’ – as in (Kingma & Welling, 2013) the noise is treated as an additional auxiliary variable, and held constant while computing partial derivatives of K with respect to the pa- rameters. For binomial diffusion, the discrete state space makes gra- dient ascent with frozen noise impossible. We instead choose the forward diffusion scheduleβ1···T to erase a con- stant fraction 1 T of the original signal per diffusion step, yielding a diffusion rate of βt = (T −t+ 1)−1. 2.5. Multiplying Distributions, and Computing Posteriors Tasks such as computing a posterior in order to do signal denoising or inference of missing values requires multipli- cation of the model distribution p ( x(0)) with a second dis- tribution, or bounded positive function,r ( x(0)) , producing a new distribution ˜p ( x(0)) ∝p ( x(0)) r ( x(0)) . Multiplying distributions is costly and difﬁcult for many techniques, including variational autoencoders, GSNs, NADEs, and most graphical models. However, under a dif- fusion model it is straightforward, since the second distri- bution can be treated either as a small perturbation to each step in the diffusion process, or often exactly multiplied into each diffusion step. Figures 3 and 5 demonstrate the use of a diffusion model to perform denoising and inpaint- ing of natural images. The following sections describe how 2Recent experiments suggest that it is just as effective to in- stead use the same ﬁxed βt schedule as for binomial diffusion. to multiply distributions in the context of diffusion proba- bilistic models. 2.5.1. M ODIFIED MARGINAL DISTRIBUTIONS First, in order to compute ˜p ( x(0)) , we multiply each of the intermediate distributions by a corresponding function r ( x(t)) . We use a tilde above a distribution or Markov transition to denote that it belongs to a trajectory that has been modiﬁed in this way. ˜p ( x(0···T)) is the modiﬁed re- verse trajectory, which starts at the distribution ˜p ( x(T)) = 1 ˜ZT p ( x(T)) r ( x(T)) and proceeds through the sequence of intermediate distributions ˜p ( x(t) ) = 1 ˜Zt p ( x(t) ) r ( x(t) ) , (16) where ˜Zt is the normalizing constant for the tth intermedi- ate distribution. 2.5.2. M ODIFIED DIFFUSION STEPS The Markov kernel p ( x(t) |x(t+1)) for the reverse diffu- sion process obeys the equilibrium condition p ( x(t ) = ∫ dx(t+1)p ( xt) |x(t+1) ) p ( xt+1) ) . (17) We wish the perturbed Markov kernel ˜p ( x(t) |x(t+1)) to instead obey the equilibrium condition for the perturbed distribution, ˜p ( x(t) ) = ∫ dx(t+1) ˜p ( x(t) |x(t+1) ) ˜p ( xt+1) ) , (18) p ( x(t)) r ( x(t)) ˜Zt = ∫ dx(t+1) ˜p ( x(t) |x(t+1) ) · p ( x(t+1)) r ( x(t+1)) ˜Zt+1 , (19) p ( x(t) ) = ∫ dx(t+1) ˜p ( x(t) |x(t+1) ) · ˜Ztr ( x(t+1)) ˜Zt+1r ( x(t))p ( x(t+1) ) . (20) Equation 20 will be satisﬁed if ˜p ( x(t)|x(t+1) ) = p ( x(t)|x(t+1) ) ˜Zt+1r ( x(t)) ˜Ztr ( x(t+1)). (21) Equation 21 may not correspond to a normalized proba- bility distribution, so we choose ˜p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) to be the corresponding normalized distribution ˜p ( x(t)|x(t+1) ) = 1 ˜Zt ( x(t+1))p ( x(t)|x(t+1) ) r ( x(t) ) , (22)Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics (a) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 250 (b) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 250 (c) 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 250 Figure 4.

(b) A sample from the previous state of the art natural image model (Theis et al., 2012) trained on identical data, reproduced here with permission. (c) A sample generated by the diffusion model. Note that it demonstrates fairly consistent occlusion relationships, displays a multiscale distribution over object sizes, and produces circle-like objects, especially at smaller scales. As shown in Table 2, the diffusion model has the highest log likelihood on the test set. where ˜Zt ( x(t+1)) is the normalization constant. For a Gaussian, each diffusion step is typically very sharply peaked relative to r ( x(t)) , due to its small variance. This means that r(x(t)) r(x(t+1)) can be treated as a small perturbation to p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) . A small perturbation to a Gaussian ef- fects the mean, but not the normalization constant, so in this case Equations 21 and 22 are equivalent (see Appendix C). 2.5.3. A PPLYING r ( x(t)) If r ( x(t)) is sufﬁciently smooth, then it can be treated as a small perturbation to the reverse diffusion kernel p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) . In this case ˜p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) will have an identical functional form to p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) , but with per- turbed mean for the Gaussian kernel, or with perturbed ﬂip rate for the binomial kernel. The perturbed diffusion ker- nels are given in Table App.1, and are derived for the Gaus- sian in Appendix C. If r ( x(t)) can be multiplied with a Gaussian (or binomial) distribution in closed form, then it can be directly multi- plied with the reverse diffusion kernel p ( x(t)|x(t+1)) in closed form. This applies in the case where r ( x(t)) con- sists of a delta function for some subset of coordinates, as in the inpainting example in Figure 5. 2.5.4. C HOOSING r ( x(t)) Typically,r ( x(t)) should be chosen to change slowly over the course of the trajectory. For the experiments in this paper we chose it to be constant, r ( x(t) ) = r ( x(0) ) . (23) Another convenient choice is r ( x(t)) = r ( x(0))T−t T . Un- der this second choicer ( x(t)) makes no contribution to the starting distribution for the reverse trajectory. This guaran- tees that drawing the initial sample from ˜p ( x(T)) for the reverse trajectory remains straightforward. 2.6. Entropy of Reverse Process Since the forward process is known, we can derive upper and lower bounds on the conditional entropy of each step in the reverse trajectory, and thus on the log likelihood, Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) ≤Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≤Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) , (24) where both the upper and lower bounds depend only on q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) , and can be analytically computed. The derivation is provided in Appendix A. 3. Experiments We train diffusion probabilistic models on a variety of con- tinuous datasets, and a binary dataset. We then demonstrate sampling from the trained model and inpainting of miss- ing data, and compare model performance against other techniques. In all cases the objective function and gradi- ent were computed using Theano (Bergstra & Breuleux, 2010). Model training was with SFO (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2014), except for CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10 results used the 3 An earlier version of this paper reported higher log likeli- hood bounds on CIFAR-10. These were the result of the model learning the 8-bit quantization of pixel values in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The log likelihood bounds reported here are instead for data that has been pre-processed by adding uniform noise to re- move pixel quantization, as recommended in (Theis et al., 2015).Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics (a) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 (b) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 (c) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Figure 5.

Note the long-range spatial structure, for instance in the crack entering on the left side of the inpainted region. The sample from the posterior was generated as described in Section 2.5, where r ( x(0) ) was set to a delta function for known data, and a constant for missing data.

The log likelihood under the true distribution is log2 (1 5 ) = −2.322 bits per sequence. As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 1 learning was nearly perfect. See Appendix Section D.1.2 for more details. 3.2. Images We trained Gaussian diffusion probabilistic models on sev- eral image datasets. The multi-scale convolutional archi-Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics tecture shared by these experiments is described in Ap- pendix Section D.2.1, and illustrated in Figure D.1. 3.2.1. D ATASETS MNIST In order to allow a direct comparison against previous work on a simple dataset, we trained on MNIST digits (LeCun & Cortes, 1998). Log likelihoods relative to (Bengio et al., 2012; Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014) are given in Table 2. Samples from the MNIST model are given in Appendix Figure App.1. Our training algorithm provides an asymptotically consistent lower bound on the log likelihood. However most previous reported results on continuous MNIST log likelihood rely on Parzen-window based estimates com- puted from model samples. For this comparison we there- fore estimate MNIST log likelihood using the Parzen- window code released with (Goodfellow et al., 2014). CIFAR-10 A probabilistic model was ﬁt to the training images for the CIFAR-10 challenge dataset (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009). Samples from the trained model are pro- vided in Figure 3. Dead Leaf Images Dead leaf images (Jeulin, 1997; Lee et al., 2001) consist of layered occluding circles, drawn from a power law distribution over scales. They have an an- alytically tractable structure, but capture many of the statis- tical complexities of natural images, and therefore provide a compelling test case for natural image models. As illus- trated in Table 2 and Figure 4, we achieve state of the art performance on the dead leaves dataset. Bark Texture Images A probabilistic model was trained on bark texture images (T01-T04) from (Lazebnik et al., 2005). For this dataset we demonstrate that it is straightfor- ward to evaluate or generate from a posterior distribution, by inpainting a large region of missing data using a sample from the model posterior in Figure 5. 4. Conclusion We have introduced a novel algorithm for modeling proba- bility distributions that enables exact sampling and evalua- tion of probabilities and demonstrated its effectiveness on a variety of toy and real datasets, including challenging natu- ral image datasets. For each of these tests we used a similar basic algorithm, showing that our method can accurately model a wide variety of distributions. Most existing den- sity estimation techniques must sacriﬁce modeling power in order to stay tractable and efﬁcient, and sampling or evaluation are often extremely expensive. The core of our algorithm consists of estimating the reversal of a Markov diffusion chain which maps data to a noise distribution; as the number of steps is made large, the reversal distribution of each diffusion step becomes simple and easy to estimate. The result is an algorithm that can learn a ﬁt to any data dis- tribution, but which remains tractable to train,exactly sam- ple from, and evaluate, and under which it is straightfor- ward to manipulate conditional and posterior distributions.

Conditional Entropy Bounds Derivation The conditional entropy Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t)) of a step in the reverse trajectory is Hq ( X(t−1),X(t) ) = Hq ( X(t),X(t−1) ) (25) Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) + Hq ( X(t) ) = Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1) ) (26) Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) = Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) (27) An upper bound on the entropy change can be constructed by observing that π(y) is the maximum entropy distribution. This holds without qualiﬁcation for the binomial distribution, and holds for variance 1 training data for the Gaussian case. For the Gaussian case, training data must therefore be scaled to have unit norm for the following equalities to hold. It need not be whitened. The upper bound is derived as follows, Hq ( X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(t−1) ) (28) Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≤0 (29) Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≤Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) . (30) A lower bound on the entropy difference can be established by observing that additional steps in a Markov chain do not increase the information available about the initial state in the chain, and thus do not decrease the conditional entropy of the initial state, Hq ( X(0)|X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(0)|X(t−1) ) (31) Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(0)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(0)|X(t) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) (32) Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(0),X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(0),X(t) ) (33) Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) (34) Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) . (35) Combining these expressions, we bound the conditional entropy for a single step, Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) ≥Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≥Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) + Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) , (36) where both the upper and lower bounds depend only on the conditional forward trajectory q ( x(1···T)|x(0)) , and can be analytically computed. B. Log Likelihood Lower Bound The lower bound on the log likelihood is L≥K (37) K = ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(T) ) T∏ t=1 p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] (38) (39)Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics B.1. Entropy ofp ( X(T)) We can peel off the contribution fromp ( X(T)) , and rewrite it as an entropy, K = ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) T∑ t=1 log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] + ∫ dx(T)q ( x(T) ) log p ( x(T) ) (40) = ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) T∑ t=1 log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] + ∫ dx(T)q ( x(T) ) log π ( xT) (41) . (42) By design, the cross entropy to π ( x(t)) is constant under our diffusion kernels, and equal to the entropy of p ( x(T)) . Therefore, K = T∑ t=1 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] −Hp ( X(T) ) . (43) B.2. Remove the edge effect att= 0 In order to avoid edge effects, we set the ﬁnal step of the reverse trajectory to be identical to the corresponding forward diffusion step, p ( x(0)|x(1) ) = q ( x(1)|x(0) )π ( x(0)) π ( x(1)) = Tπ ( x(0)|x(1); β1 ) . (44) We then use this equivalence to remove the contribution of the ﬁrst time-step in the sum, K = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] + ∫ dx(0)dx(1)q ( x(0),x(1) ) log [ q ( x(1)|x(0)) π ( x(0)) q ( x(1)|x(0)) π ( x(1)) ] −Hp ( X(T) ) (45) = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) ] −Hp ( X(T) ) , (46) where we again used the fact that by design − ∫ dx(t)q ( x(t)) log π ( x(t)) = Hp ( X(T)) is a constant for all t. B.3. Rewrite in terms of posteriorq ( x(t−1)|x(0)) Because the forward trajectory is a Markov process, K = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t)|x(t−1),x(0)) ] −Hp ( X(T) ) . (47) Using Bayes’ rule we can rewrite this in terms of a posterior and marginals from the forward trajectory, K = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0))q ( x(t−1)|x(0)) q ( x(t)|x(0)) ] −Hp ( X(T) ) . (48)Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics Figure App.1. Samples from a diffusion probabilistic model trained on MNIST digits. Note that unlike many MNIST sample ﬁgures, these are true samples rather than the mean of the Gaussian or binomial distribution from which samples would be drawn. B.4. Rewrite in terms of KL divergences and entropies We then recognize that several terms are conditional entropies, K = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0)) ] + T∑ t=2 [ Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) )] −Hp ( X(T) ) (49) = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T)q ( x(0···T) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0)) ] + Hq ( X(T)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(1)|X(0) ) −Hp ( X(T) ) . (50) Finally we transform the log ratio of probability distributions into a KL divergence, K = − T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0)dx(t)q ( x(0),x(t) ) DKL ( q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0) )⏐⏐⏐ ⏐⏐⏐p ( x(t−1)|x(t) )) (51) + Hq ( X(T)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(1)|X(0) ) −Hp ( X(T) ) . Note that the entropies can be analytically computed, and the KL divergence can be analytically computed given x(0) and x(t).Gaussian Binomial Well behaved (analytically tractable) distribution π ( x(T)) = N ( x(T); 0,I ) B ( x(T); 0.5 ) Forward diffusion kernel q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) = N ( x(t); x(t−1)√1 −βt,Iβt ) B ( x(t); x(t−1) (1 −βt) + 0.5βt ) Reverse diffusion kernel p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) = N ( x(t−1); fµ ( x(t),t ) ,fΣ ( x(t),t )) B ( x(t−1); fb ( x(t),t )) Training targets fµ ( x(t),t ) , fΣ ( x(t),t ) , β1···T fb ( x(t),t ) Forward distribution q ( x(0···T)) = q ( x(0))∏T t=1 q ( x(t)|x(t−1)) Reverse distribution p ( x(0···T)) = π ( x(T))∏T t=1 p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) Log likelihood L= ∫ dx(0)q ( x(0)) log p ( x(0)) Lower bound on log likelihood K = −∑T t=2 Eq(x(0),x(t)) [ DKL ( q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0))⏐⏐⏐⏐p ( x(t−1)|x(t)))] + Hq ( X(T)|X(0)) −Hq ( X(1)|X(0)) −Hp ( X(T)) Perturbed reverse diffusion kernel ˜p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) = N ( x(t−1); fµ ( x(t),t ) + fΣ ( x(t),t )∂log r ( x(t−1)′) ∂x(t−1)′ ⏐⏐⏐⏐ x(t−1)′=fµ(x(t),t) ,fΣ ( x(t),t ) ) B ( x(t−1) i ; ct−1 i dt−1 i xt−1 i dt−1 i +(1−ct−1 i )(1−dt−1 i ) ) Table App.1. The key equations in this paper for the speciﬁc cases of Gaussian and binomial diffusion processes. N(u; µ,Σ) is a Gaussian distribution with mean µand covariance Σ. B(u; r) is the distribution for a single Bernoulli trial, with u= 1 occurring with probability r, and u= 0 occurring with probability 1 −r. Finally, for the perturbed Bernoulli trials bt i = x(t−1) (1 −βt) + 0.5βt, ct i = [ fb ( x(t+1),t )] i , and dt i = r ( x(t) i = 1 ) , and the distribution is given for a single bit i.Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics C. Perturbed Gaussian Transition We wish to compute ˜p ( x(t−1) |x(t)) . For notational simplicity, let µ = fµ ( x(t),t ) , Σ = fΣ ( x(t),t ) , and y = x(t−1). Using this notation, ˜p ( y |x(t) ) ∝p ( y |x(t) ) r(y) (52) = N(y; µ,Σ) r(y) . (53) We can rewrite this in terms of energy functions, where Er(y) = −log r(y), ˜p ( y |x(t) ) ∝exp [−E(y)] (54) E(y) = 1 2 (y −µ)T Σ−1 (y −µ) + Er(y) . (55) If Er(y) is smooth relative to 1 2 (y −µ)T Σ−1 (y −µ), then we can approximate it using its Taylor expansion around µ. One sufﬁcient condition is that the eigenvalues of the Hessian of Er(y) are everywhere much smaller magnitude than the eigenvalues of Σ−1. We then have Er(y) ≈Er(µ) + (y −µ) g (56) where g = ∂Er(y′) ∂y′ ⏐⏐⏐⏐ y′=µ . Plugging this in to the full energy, E(y) ≈1 2 (y −µ)T Σ−1 (y −µ) + (y −µ)T g + constant (57) = 1 2yTΣ−1y −1 2yTΣ−1µ−1 2µTΣ−1y + 1 2yTΣ−1Σg + 1 2gTΣΣ−1y + constant (58) = 1 2 (y −µ+ Σg)T Σ−1 (y −µ+ Σg) + constant. (59) This corresponds to a Gaussian, ˜p ( y |x(t) ) ≈N (y; µ−Σg,Σ) . (60) Substituting back in the original formalism, this is, ˜p ( x(t−1) |x(t) ) ≈N  x(t−1); fµ ( x(t),t ) + fΣ ( x(t),t )∂log r ( x(t−1)′ ) ∂x(t−1)′ ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐ x(t−1)′=fµ(x(t),t) ,fΣ ( x(t),t )  . (61)Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics D. Experimental Details D.1. Toy Problems D.1.1. S WISS ROLL A probabilistic model was built of a two dimensional swiss roll distribution. The generative model p ( x(0···T)) con- sisted of 40 time steps of Gaussian diffusion initialized at an identity-covariance Gaussian distribution. A (nor- malized) radial basis function network with a single hid- den layer and 16 hidden units was trained to generate the mean and covariance functions fµ ( x(t),t ) and a diago- nal fΣ ( x(t),t ) for the reverse trajectory. The top, read- out, layer for each function was learned independently for each time step, but for all other layers weights were shared across all time steps and both functions. The top layer out- put of fΣ ( x(t),t ) was passed through a sigmoid to restrict it between 0 and 1. As can be seen in Figure 1, the swiss roll distribution was successfully learned. D.1.2. B INARY HEARTBEAT DISTRIBUTION A probabilistic model was trained on simple binary se- quences of length 20, where a 1 occurs every 5th time bin, and the remainder of the bins are 0. The generative model consisted of 2000 time steps of binomial diffusion initialized at an independent binomial distribution with the same mean activity as the data ( p ( x(T) i = 1 ) = 0 .2). A multilayer perceptron with sigmoid nonlinearities, 20 in- put units and three hidden layers with 50 units each was trained to generate the Bernoulli rates fb ( x(t),t ) of the re- verse trajectory. The top, readout, layer was learned inde- pendently for each time step, but for all other layers weights were shared across all time steps. The top layer output was passed through a sigmoid to restrict it between 0 and 1. As can be seen in Figure 2, the heartbeat distribution was suc- cessfully learned. The log likelihood under the true gener- ating process is log2 (1 5 ) = −2.322 bits per sequence. As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 1 learning was nearly perfect. D.2. Images D.2.1. A RCHITECTURE Readout In all cases, a convolutional network was used to produce a vector of outputs yi ∈R2J for each image pixel i. The entries in yi are divided into two equal sized subsets, yµ and yΣ. Temporal Dependence The convolution output yµ is used as per-pixel weighting coefﬁcients in a sum over time- dependent “bump” functions, generating an outputzµ i ∈R for each pixel i, zµ i = J∑ j=1 yµ ijgj(t) . (62) The bump functions consist of gj(t) = exp ( − 1 2w2 (t−τj)2 ) ∑J k=1 exp ( − 1 2w2 (t−τk)2 ), (63) where τj ∈(0,T) is the bump center, and wis the spacing between bump centers. zΣ is generated in an identical way, but using yΣ. For all image experiments a number of timestepsT = 1000 was used, except for the bark dataset which used T = 500. Mean and Variance Finally, these outputs are combined to produce a diffusion mean and variance prediction for each pixel i, Σii = σ ( zΣ i + σ−1 (βt) ) , (64) µi = (xi −zµ i ) (1−Σii) + zµ i . (65) where both Σ and µ are parameterized as a perturbation around the forward diffusion kernel Tπ ( x(t)|x(t−1); βt ) , and zµ i is the mean of the equilibrium distribution that would result from applying p ( x(t−1)|x(t)) many times. Σ is restricted to be a diagonal matrix. Multi-Scale Convolution We wish to accomplish goals that are often achieved with pooling networks – specif- ically, we wish to discover and make use of long-range and multi-scale dependencies in the training data. How- ever, since the network output is a vector of coefﬁcients for every pixel it is important to generate a full resolution rather than down-sampled feature map. We therefore deﬁne multi-scale-convolution layers that consist of the following steps: 1. Perform mean pooling to downsample the image to multiple scales. Downsampling is performed in pow- ers of two. 2. Performing convolution at each scale. 3. Upsample all scales to full resolution, and sum the re- sulting images. 4. Perform a pointwise nonlinear transformation, con- sisting of a soft relu (log [1 + exp (·)]). The composition of the ﬁrst three linear operations resem- bles convolution by a multiscale convolution kernel, up to blocking artifacts introduced by upsampling. This method of achieving multiscale convolution was described in (Bar- ron et al., 2013).Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics Input Dense Multi-scale convolution Convolution 1x1 kernel Temporal coefficients Temporal coefficients Dense Multi-scale convolution Mean image Covariance image Convolution 1x1 kernel Figure D.1. Network architecture for mean function fµ ( x(t),t ) and covariance function fΣ ( x(t),t ) , for experiments in Section 3.2. The input image x(t) passes through several layers of multi- scale convolution (Section D.2.1). It then passes through several convolutional layers with 1 ×1 kernels. This is equivalent to a dense transformation performed on each pixel. A linear transfor- mation generates coefﬁcients for readout of both mean µ(t) and covariance Σ(t) for each pixel. Finally, a time dependent readout function converts those coefﬁcients into mean and covariance im- ages, as described in Section D.2.1. For CIFAR-10 a dense (or fully connected) pathway was used in parallel to the multi-scale convolutional pathway. For MNIST, the dense pathway was used to the exclusion of the multi-scale convolutional pathway. Dense Layers Dense (acting on the full image vector) and kernel-width-1 convolutional (acting separately on the feature vector for each pixel) layers share the same form. They consist of a linear transformation, followed by a tanh nonlinearity.",

Generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, ﬂows, and variational autoencoders (V AEs) have synthesized striking image and audio samples [ 14, 27, 3, 58, 38, 25, 10, 32, 44, 57, 26, 33, 45], and there have been remarkable advances in energy-based modeling and score matching that have produced images comparable to those of GANs [11, 55].

This paper presents progress in diffusion probabilistic models [53]. A diffusion probabilistic model (which we will call a “diffusion model” for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using variational inference to produce samples matching the data after ﬁnite time. Transitions of this chain are learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the data in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of small amounts of Gaussian noise, it is sufﬁcient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional Gaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization. Diffusion models are straightforward to deﬁne and efﬁcient to train, but to the best of our knowledge, there has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We show that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes better than the published results on other types of generative models (Section 4). In addition, we show that a certain parameterization of diffusion models reveals an equivalence with denoising score matching over multiple noise levels during training and with annealed Langevin dynamics during sampling (Section 3.2) [ 55, 61]. We obtained our best sample quality results using this parameterization (Section 4.2), so we consider this equivalence to be one of our primary contributions. Despite their sample quality, our models do not have competitive log likelihoods compared to other likelihood-based models (our models do, however, have log likelihoods better than the large estimates annealed importance sampling has been reported to produce for energy based models and score matching [11, 55]). We ﬁnd that the majority of our models’ lossless codelengths are consumed to describe imperceptible image details (Section 4.3). We present a more reﬁned analysis of this phenomenon in the language of lossy compression, and we show that the sampling procedure of diffusion models is a type of progressive decoding that resembles autoregressive decoding along a bit ordering that vastly generalizes what is normally possible with autoregressive models. 2 Background Diffusion models [53] are latent variable models of the form pθ(x0) := ∫ pθ(x0:T) dx1:T, where x1,..., xT are latents of the same dimensionality as the data x0 ∼q(x0). The joint distribution pθ(x0:T) is called the reverse process, and it is deﬁned as a Markov chain with learned Gaussian transitions starting at p(xT) = N(xT; 0,I): pθ(x0:T) := p(xT) T∏ t=1 pθ(xt−1|xt), p θ(xt−1|xt) := N(xt−1; µθ(xt,t),Σθ(xt,t)) (1) What distinguishes diffusion models from other types of latent variable models is that the approximate posterior q(x1:T|x0), called the forward processor diffusion process, is ﬁxed to a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data according to a variance schedule β1,...,β T: q(x1:T|x0) := T∏ t=1 q(xt|xt−1), q (xt|xt−1) := N(xt; √ 1 −βtxt−1,βtI) (2) Training is performed by optimizing the usual variational bound on negative log likelihood: E[−log pθ(x0)] ≤Eq [ −log pθ(x0:T) q(x1:T|x0) ] = Eq [ −log p(xT) − ∑ t≥1 log pθ(xt−1|xt) q(xt|xt−1) ] =: L (3) The forward process variances βt can be learned by reparameterization [ 33] or held constant as hyperparameters, and expressiveness of the reverse process is ensured in part by the choice of Gaussian conditionals in pθ(xt−1|xt), because both processes have the same functional form when βt are small [ 53]. A notable property of the forward process is that it admits sampling xt at an arbitrary timestep tin closed form: using the notation αt := 1 −βt and ¯αt := ∏t s=1 αs, we have q(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯αtx0,(1 −¯αt)I) (4) 2Efﬁcient training is therefore possible by optimizing random terms of Lwith stochastic gradient descent. Further improvements come from variance reduction by rewriting L(3) as: Eq [ DKL(q(xT|x0) ∥p(xT))   LT + ∑ t>1 DKL(q(xt−1|xt,x0) ∥pθ(xt−1|xt))   Lt−1 −log pθ(x0|x1)   L0 ] (5) (See Appendix A for details. The labels on the terms are used in Section 3.) Equation (5) uses KL divergence to directly compare pθ(xt−1|xt) against forward process posteriors, which are tractable when conditioned on x0: q(xt−1|xt,x0) = N(xt−1; ˜µt(xt,x0),˜βtI), (6) where ˜µt(xt,x0) := √¯αt−1βt 1 −¯αt x0 + √αt(1 −¯αt−1) 1 −¯αt xt and ˜βt := 1 −¯αt−1 1 −¯αt βt (7) Consequently, all KL divergences in Eq. (5) are comparisons between Gaussians, so they can be calculated in a Rao-Blackwellized fashion with closed form expressions instead of high variance Monte Carlo estimates. 3 Diffusion models and denoising autoencoders Diffusion models might appear to be a restricted class of latent variable models, but they allow a large number of degrees of freedom in implementation. One must choose the variances βt of the forward process and the model architecture and Gaussian distribution parameterization of the reverse process. To guide our choices, we establish a new explicit connection between diffusion models and denoising score matching (Section 3.2) that leads to a simpliﬁed, weighted variational bound objective for diffusion models (Section 3.4). Ultimately, our model design is justiﬁed by simplicity and empirical results (Section 4). Our discussion is categorized by the terms of Eq. (5). 3.1 Forward process and LT We ignore the fact that the forward process variances βt are learnable by reparameterization and instead ﬁx them to constants (see Section 4 for details). Thus, in our implementation, the approximate posterior qhas no learnable parameters, so LT is a constant during training and can be ignored. 3.2 Reverse process and L1:T−1 Now we discuss our choices in pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; µθ(xt,t),Σθ(xt,t)) for 1 <t ≤T. First, we set Σθ(xt,t) = σ2 tI to untrained time dependent constants. Experimentally, both σ2 t = βt and σ2 t = ˜βt = 1−¯αt−1 1−¯αt βt had similar results. The ﬁrst choice is optimal for x0 ∼N (0,I), and the second is optimal for x0 deterministically set to one point. These are the two extreme choices corresponding to upper and lower bounds on reverse process entropy for data with coordinatewise unit variance [53]. Second, to represent the mean µθ(xt,t), we propose a speciﬁc parameterization motivated by the following analysis of Lt. With pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; µθ(xt,t),σ2 tI), we can write: Lt−1 = Eq [ 1 2σ2 t ∥˜µt(xt,x0) −µθ(xt,t)∥2 ] + C (8) where Cis a constant that does not depend on θ. So, we see that the most straightforward parameteri- zation of µθ is a model that predicts ˜µt, the forward process posterior mean. However, we can expand Eq. (8) further by reparameterizing Eq. (4) as xt(x0,ϵ) = √¯αtx0 + √1 −¯αtϵ for ϵ ∼N(0,I) and applying the forward process posterior formula (7): Lt−1 −C = Ex0,ϵ [ 1 2σ2 t ˜µt ( xt(x0,ϵ), 1√¯αt (xt(x0,ϵ) − √ 1 −¯αtϵ) ) −µθ(xt(x0,ϵ),t)  2] (9) = Ex0,ϵ [ 1 2σ2 t  1√αt ( xt(x0,ϵ) − βt√1 −¯αt ϵ ) −µθ(xt(x0,ϵ),t)  2] (10) 3Algorithm 1 Training 1: repeat 2: x0 ∼q(x0) 3: t∼Uniform({1,...,T }) 4: ϵ ∼N(0,I) 5: Take gradient descent step on ∇θ ϵ −ϵθ(√¯αtx0 + √1 −¯αtϵ,t) 2 6: until converged Algorithm 2 Sampling 1: xT ∼N(0,I) 2: for t= T,..., 1 do 3: z ∼N(0,I) if t> 1, else z = 0 4: xt−1 = 1√αt ( xt − 1−αt√1−¯αt ϵθ(xt,t) ) + σtz 5: end for 6: return x0 Equation (10) reveals that µθ must predict 1√αt ( xt − βt√1−¯αt ϵ ) given xt. Since xt is available as input to the model, we may choose the parameterization µθ(xt,t) = ˜µt ( xt, 1√¯αt (xt − √ 1 −¯αtϵθ(xt)) ) = 1√αt ( xt − βt√1 −¯αt ϵθ(xt,t) ) (11) where ϵθ is a function approximator intended to predict ϵ from xt. To sample xt−1 ∼pθ(xt−1|xt) is to compute xt−1 = 1√αt ( xt − βt√1−¯αt ϵθ(xt,t) ) +σtz, where z ∼N(0,I). The complete sampling procedure, Algorithm 2, resembles Langevin dynamics with ϵθ as a learned gradient of the data density. Furthermore, with the parameterization (11), Eq. (10) simpliﬁes to: Ex0,ϵ [ β2 t 2σ2 tαt(1 −¯αt) ϵ −ϵθ(√¯αtx0 + √ 1 −¯αtϵ,t) 2 ] (12) which resembles denoising score matching over multiple noise scales indexed by t[55]. As Eq. (12) is equal to (one term of) the variational bound for the Langevin-like reverse process (11), we see that optimizing an objective resembling denoising score matching is equivalent to using variational inference to ﬁt the ﬁnite-time marginal of a sampling chain resembling Langevin dynamics. To summarize, we can train the reverse process mean function approximator µθ to predict ˜µt, or by modifying its parameterization, we can train it to predict ϵ. (There is also the possibility of predicting x0, but we found this to lead to worse sample quality early in our experiments.) We have shown that the ϵ-prediction parameterization both resembles Langevin dynamics and simpliﬁes the diffusion model’s variational bound to an objective that resembles denoising score matching. Nonetheless, it is just another parameterization of pθ(xt−1|xt), so we verify its effectiveness in Section 4 in an ablation where we compare predicting ϵ against predicting ˜µt. 3.3 Data scaling, reverse process decoder, and L0 We assume that image data consists of integers in {0,1,..., 255}scaled linearly to [−1,1]. This ensures that the neural network reverse process operates on consistently scaled inputs starting from the standard normal prior p(xT). To obtain discrete log likelihoods, we set the last term of the reverse process to an independent discrete decoder derived from the Gaussian N(x0; µθ(x1,1),σ2 1I): pθ(x0|x1) = D∏ i=1 ∫ δ+(xi 0) δ−(xi 0) N(x; µi θ(x1,1),σ2 1) dx δ+(x) = {∞ if x= 1 x+ 1 255 if x< 1 δ−(x) = {−∞ if x= −1 x− 1 255 if x> −1 (13) where D is the data dimensionality and the i superscript indicates extraction of one coordinate. (It would be straightforward to instead incorporate a more powerful decoder like a conditional autoregressive model, but we leave that to future work.) Similar to the discretized continuous distributions used in V AE decoders and autoregressive models [34, 52], our choice here ensures that the variational bound is a lossless codelength of discrete data, without need of adding noise to the data or incorporating the Jacobian of the scaling operation into the log likelihood. At the end of sampling, we display µθ(x1,1) noiselessly. 3.4 Simpliﬁed training objective With the reverse process and decoder deﬁned above, the variational bound, consisting of terms derived from Eqs. (12) and (13), is clearly differentiable with respect to θand is ready to be employed for 4Table 1: CIFAR10 results. NLL measured in bits/dim.

However, we found it beneﬁcial to sample quality (and simpler to implement) to train on the following variant of the variational bound: Lsimple(θ) := Et,x0,ϵ [ϵ −ϵθ(√¯αtx0 + √ 1 −¯αtϵ,t) 2] (14) where tis uniform between 1 and T. The t = 1 case corresponds to L0 with the integral in the discrete decoder deﬁnition (13) approximated by the Gaussian probability density function times the bin width, ignoring σ2 1 and edge effects. The t >1 cases correspond to an unweighted version of Eq. (12), analogous to the loss weighting used by the NCSN denoising score matching model [55]. (LT does not appear because the forward process variances βt are ﬁxed.) Algorithm 1 displays the complete training procedure with this simpliﬁed objective. Since our simpliﬁed objective (14) discards the weighting in Eq. (12), it is a weighted variational bound that emphasizes different aspects of reconstruction compared to the standard variational bound [18, 22]. In particular, our diffusion process setup in Section 4 causes the simpliﬁed objective to down-weight loss terms corresponding to small t. These terms train the network to denoise data with very small amounts of noise, so it is beneﬁcial to down-weight them so that the network can focus on more difﬁcult denoising tasks at larger tterms. We will see in our experiments that this reweighting leads to better sample quality. 4 Experiments We set T = 1000 for all experiments so that the number of neural network evaluations needed during sampling matches previous work [53, 55]. We set the forward process variances to constants increasing linearly from β1 = 10 −4 to βT = 0 .02. These constants were chosen to be small relative to data scaled to [−1,1], ensuring that reverse and forward processes have approximately the same functional form while keeping the signal-to-noise ratio at xT as small as possible (LT = DKL(q(xT|x0) ∥N(0,I)) ≈10−5 bits per dimension in our experiments). To represent the reverse process, we use a U-Net backbone similar to an unmasked PixelCNN++ [52, 48] with group normalization throughout [66]. Parameters are shared across time, which is speciﬁed to the network using the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding [60]. We use self-attention at the 16 ×16 feature map resolution [63, 60]. Details are in Appendix B. 4.1 Sample quality Table 1 shows Inception scores, FID scores, and negative log likelihoods (lossless codelengths) on CIFAR10. With our FID score of 3.17, our unconditional model achieves better sample quality than most models in the literature, including class conditional models. Our FID score is computed with respect to the training set, as is standard practice; when we compute it with respect to the test set, the score is 5.24, which is still better than many of the training set FID scores in the literature. 5Figure 3: LSUN Church samples.

See Fig. 1 for CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ 256 ×256 samples, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 for LSUN 256 ×256 samples [71], and Appendix D for more. 4.2 Reverse process parameterization and training objective ablation In Table 2, we show the sample quality effects of reverse process parameterizations and training objectives (Section 3.2). We ﬁnd that the baseline option of predicting ˜µ works well only when trained on the true variational bound instead of unweighted mean squared error, a simpliﬁed objective akin to Eq. (14). We also see that learning reverse process variances (by incorporating a parameterized diagonal Σθ(xt) into the variational bound) leads to unstable training and poorer sample quality compared to ﬁxed variances. Predicting ϵ, as we proposed, performs approximately as well as predicting ˜µ when trained on the variational bound with ﬁxed variances, but much better when trained with our simpliﬁed objective. 4.3 Progressive coding Table 1 also shows the codelengths of our CIFAR10 models. The gap between train and test is at most 0.03 bits per dimension, which is comparable to the gaps reported with other likelihood-based models and indicates that our diffusion model is not overﬁtting (see Appendix D for nearest neighbor visualizations). Still, while our lossless codelengths are better than the large estimates reported for energy based models and score matching using annealed importance sampling [ 11], they are not competitive with other types of likelihood-based generative models [7]. Since our samples are nonetheless of high quality, we conclude that diffusion models have an inductive bias that makes them excellent lossy compressors. Treating the variational bound termsL1 +···+LT as rate and L0 as distortion, our CIFAR10 model with the highest quality samples has a rate of 1.78 bits/dim and a distortion of 1.97 bits/dim, which amounts to a root mean squared error of 0.95 on a scale from 0 to 255. More than half of the lossless codelength describes imperceptible distortions. Progressive lossy compression We can probe further into the rate-distortion behavior of our model by introducing a progressive lossy code that mirrors the form of Eq. (5): see Algorithms 3 and 4, which assume access to a procedure, such as minimal random coding [19, 20], that can transmit a sample x ∼q(x) using approximately DKL(q(x) ∥p(x)) bits on average for any distributions pand q, for which onlypis available to the receiver beforehand. When applied tox0 ∼q(x0), Algorithms 3 and 4 transmit xT,..., x0 in sequence using a total expected codelength equal to Eq. (5). The receiver, 6at any time t, has the partial information xt fully available and can progressively estimate: x0 ≈ˆx0 = ( xt − √ 1 −¯αtϵθ(xt) ) /√¯αt (15) due to Eq. (4). (A stochastic reconstruction x0 ∼pθ(x0|xt) is also valid, but we do not consider it here because it makes distortion more difﬁcult to evaluate.) Figure 5 shows the resulting rate- distortion plot on the CIFAR10 test set. At each time t, the distortion is calculated as the root mean squared error √ ∥x0 −ˆx0∥2/D, and the rate is calculated as the cumulative number of bits received so far at time t. The distortion decreases steeply in the low-rate region of the rate-distortion plot, indicating that the majority of the bits are indeed allocated to imperceptible distortions. 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 0 20 40 60 80 Reverse process steps (T −t) Distortion (RMSE) 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 0 0.5 1 1.5 Reverse process steps (T −t) Rate (bits/dim) 0 0.5 1 1.5 0 20 40 60 80 Rate (bits/dim) Distortion (RMSE) Figure 5: Unconditional CIFAR10 test set rate-distortion vs. time. Distortion is measured in root mean squared error on a [0,255] scale. See Table 4 for details. Progressive generation We also run a progressive unconditional generation process given by progressive decompression from random bits. In other words, we predict the result of the reverse process, ˆx0, while sampling from the reverse process using Algorithm 2. Figures 6 and 10 show the resulting sample quality of ˆx0 over the course of the reverse process. Large scale image features appear ﬁrst and details appear last. Figure 7 shows stochastic predictions x0 ∼pθ(x0|xt) with xt frozen for various t. When tis small, all but ﬁne details are preserved, and when tis large, only large scale features are preserved. Perhaps these are hints of conceptual compression [18]. Figure 6: Unconditional CIFAR10 progressive generation (ˆx0 over time, from left to right). Extended samples and sample quality metrics over time in the appendix (Figs. 10 and 14). Figure 7: When conditioned on the same latent, CelebA-HQ 256 ×256 samples share high-level attributes. Bottom-right quadrants are xt, and other quadrants are samples from pθ(x0|xt). Connection to autoregressive decoding Note that the variational bound (5) can be rewritten as: L= DKL(q(xT) ∥p(xT)) + Eq [∑ t≥1 DKL(q(xt−1|xt) ∥pθ(xt−1|xt)) ] + H(x0) (16) (See Appendix A for a derivation.) Now consider setting the diffusion process length T to the dimensionality of the data, deﬁning the forward process so that q(xt|x0) places all probability mass on x0 with the ﬁrst tcoordinates masked out (i.e. q(xt|xt−1) masks out the tth coordinate), setting p(xT) to place all mass on a blank image, and, for the sake of argument, taking pθ(xt−1|xt) to 7Figure 8: Interpolations of CelebA-HQ 256x256 images with 500 timesteps of diffusion. be a fully expressive conditional distribution. With these choices, DKL(q(xT) ∥p(xT)) = 0, and minimizing DKL(q(xt−1|xt) ∥pθ(xt−1|xt)) trains pθ to copy coordinates t+ 1,...,T unchanged and to predict the tth coordinate given t+ 1,...,T . Thus, training pθ with this particular diffusion is training an autoregressive model. We can therefore interpret the Gaussian diffusion model (2) as a kind of autoregressive model with a generalized bit ordering that cannot be expressed by reordering data coordinates. Prior work has shown that such reorderings introduce inductive biases that have an impact on sample quality [38], so we speculate that the Gaussian diffusion serves a similar purpose, perhaps to greater effect since Gaussian noise might be more natural to add to images compared to masking noise. Moreover, the Gaussian diffusion length is not restricted to equal the data dimension; for instance, we useT = 1000, which is less than the dimension of the 32 ×32 ×3 or 256 ×256 ×3 images in our experiments. Gaussian diffusions can be made shorter for fast sampling or longer for model expressiveness. 4.4 Interpolation We can interpolate source images x0,x′ 0 ∼q(x0) in latent space using q as a stochastic encoder, xt,x′ t ∼q(xt|x0), then decoding the linearly interpolated latent ¯xt = (1 −λ)x0 + λx′ 0 into image space by the reverse process, ¯x0 ∼p(x0|¯xt). In effect, we use the reverse process to remove artifacts from linearly interpolating corrupted versions of the source images, as depicted in Fig. 8 (left). We ﬁxed the noise for different values of λ so xt and x′ t remain the same. Fig. 8 (right) shows interpolations and reconstructions of original CelebA-HQ 256 ×256 images (t= 500). The reverse process produces high-quality reconstructions, and plausible interpolations that smoothly vary attributes such as pose, skin tone, hairstyle, expression and background, but not eyewear. Larger tresults in coarser and more varied interpolations, with novel samples at t= 1000 (Appendix Fig. 9). 5 Related Work While diffusion models might resemble ﬂows [ 9, 46, 10, 32, 5, 16, 23] and V AEs [33, 47, 37], diffusion models are designed so that qhas no parameters and the top-level latent xT has nearly zero mutual information with the data x0. Our ϵ-prediction reverse process parameterization establishes a connection between diffusion models and denoising score matching over multiple noise levels with annealed Langevin dynamics for sampling [55, 56]. Diffusion models, however, admit straightforward log likelihood evaluation, and the training procedure explicitly trains the Langevin dynamics sampler using variational inference (see Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse implication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational inference to train a Langevin-like sampler. Other methods for learning transition operators of Markov chains include infusion training [2], variational walkback [15], generative stochastic networks [1], and others [50, 54, 36, 42, 35, 65]. By the known connection between score matching and energy-based modeling, our work could have implications for other recent work on energy-based models [67–69, 12, 70, 13, 11, 41, 17, 8]. Our rate-distortion curves are computed over time in one evaluation of the variational bound, reminiscent of how rate-distortion curves can be computed over distortion penalties in one run of annealed importance sampling [24]. Our progressive decoding argument can be seen in convolutional DRAW and related models [ 18, 40] and may also lead to more general designs for subscale orderings or sampling strategies for autoregressive models [38, 64]. 86 Conclusion We have presented high quality image samples using diffusion models, and we have found connections among diffusion models and variational inference for training Markov chains, denoising score matching and annealed Langevin dynamics (and energy-based models by extension), autoregressive models, and progressive lossy compression. Since diffusion models seem to have excellent inductive biases for image data, we look forward to investigating their utility in other data modalities and as components in other types of generative models and machine learning systems. Broader Impact Our work on diffusion models takes on a similar scope as existing work on other types of deep generative models, such as efforts to improve the sample quality of GANs, ﬂows, autoregressive models, and so forth. Our paper represents progress in making diffusion models a generally useful tool in this family of techniques, so it may serve to amplify any impacts that generative models have had (and will have) on the broader world. Unfortunately, there are numerous well-known malicious uses of generative models. Sample gen- eration techniques can be employed to produce fake images and videos of high proﬁle ﬁgures for political purposes. While fake images were manually created long before software tools were avail- able, generative models such as ours make the process easier. Fortunately, CNN-generated images currently have subtle ﬂaws that allow detection [62], but improvements in generative models may make this more difﬁcult. Generative models also reﬂect the biases in the datasets on which they are trained. As many large datasets are collected from the internet by automated systems, it can be difﬁcult to remove these biases, especially when the images are unlabeled. If samples from generative models trained on these datasets proliferate throughout the internet, then these biases will only be reinforced further. On the other hand, diffusion models may be useful for data compression, which, as data becomes higher resolution and as global internet trafﬁc increases, might be crucial to ensure accessibility of the internet to wide audiences. Our work might contribute to representation learning on unlabeled raw data for a large range of downstream tasks, from image classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning, and diffusion models might also become viable for creative uses in art, photography, and music.

We replaced weight normalization [49] with group normalization [66] to make the implementation simpler. Our 32 ×32 models use four feature map resolutions (32 ×32 to 4 ×4), and our 256 ×256 models use six. All models have two convolutional residual blocks per resolution level and self-attention blocks at the 16 ×16 resolution between the convolutional blocks [6]. Diffusion time tis speciﬁed by adding the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding [60] into each residual block. Our CIFAR10 model has 35.7 million parameters, and our LSUN and CelebA-HQ models have 114 million parameters. We also trained a larger variant of the LSUN Bedroom model with approximately 256 million parameters by increasing ﬁlter count. We used TPU v3-8 (similar to 8 V100 GPUs) for all experiments. Our CIFAR model trains at 21 steps per second at batch size 128 (10.6 hours to train to completion at 800k steps), and sampling a batch of 256 images takes 17 seconds. Our CelebA-HQ/LSUN (256 2) models train at 2.2 steps per second at batch size 64, and sampling a batch of 128 images takes 300 seconds. We trained on CelebA-HQ for 0.5M steps, LSUN Bedroom for 2.4M steps, LSUN Cat for 1.8M steps, and LSUN Church for 1.2M steps. The larger LSUN Bedroom model was trained for 1.15M steps. Apart from an initial choice of hyperparameters early on to make network size ﬁt within memory constraints, we performed the majority of our hyperparameter search to optimize for CIFAR10 sample quality, then transferred the resulting settings over to the other datasets: • We chose the βt schedule from a set of constant, linear, and quadratic schedules, all constrained so that LT ≈0. We set T = 1000 without a sweep, and we chose a linear schedule from β1 = 10−4 to βT = 0.02. • We set the dropout rate on CIFAR10 to0.1 by sweeping over the values {0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4}. Without dropout on CIFAR10, we obtained poorer samples reminiscent of the overﬁtting artifacts in an unregularized PixelCNN++ [52]. We set dropout rate on the other datasets to zero without sweeping. • We used random horizontal ﬂips during training for CIFAR10; we tried training both with and without ﬂips, and found ﬂips to improve sample quality slightly. We also used random horizontal ﬂips for all other datasets except LSUN Bedroom. • We tried Adam [31] and RMSProp early on in our experimentation process and chose the former. We left the hyperparameters to their standard values. We set the learning rate to 2 ×10−4 without any sweeping, and we lowered it to 2 ×10−5 for the 256 ×256 images, which seemed unstable to train with the larger learning rate. 14• We set the batch size to 128 for CIFAR10 and 64 for larger images. We did not sweep over these values. • We used EMA on model parameters with a decay factor of 0.9999. We did not sweep over this value. Final experiments were trained once and evaluated throughout training for sample quality. Sample quality scores and log likelihood are reported on the minimum FID value over the course of training. On CIFAR10, we calculated Inception and FID scores on 50000 samples using the original code from the OpenAI [ 51] and TTUR [ 21] repositories, respectively. On LSUN, we calculated FID scores on 50000 samples using code from the StyleGAN2 [30] repository. CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ were loaded as provided by TensorFlow Datasets ( https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), and LSUN was prepared using code from StyleGAN. Dataset splits (or lack thereof) are standard from the papers that introduced their usage in a generative modeling context. All details can be found in the source code release. C Discussion on related work Our model architecture, forward process deﬁnition, and prior differ from NCSN [55, 56] in subtle but important ways that improve sample quality, and, notably, we directly train our sampler as a latent variable model rather than adding it after training post-hoc. In greater detail: 1. We use a U-Net with self-attention; NCSN uses a ReﬁneNet with dilated convolutions. We condition all layers on tby adding in the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding, rather than only in normalization layers (NCSNv1) or only at the output (v2). 2. Diffusion models scale down the data with each forward process step (by a √1 −βt factor) so that variance does not grow when adding noise, thus providing consistently scaled inputs to the neural net reverse process. NCSN omits this scaling factor. 3. Unlike NCSN, our forward process destroys signal (DKL(q(xT|x0) ∥N(0,I)) ≈0), ensur- ing a close match between the prior and aggregate posterior of xT. Also unlike NCSN, our βt are very small, which ensures that the forward process is reversible by a Markov chain with conditional Gaussians. Both of these factors prevent distribution shift when sampling. 4. Our Langevin-like sampler has coefﬁcients (learning rate, noise scale, etc.) derived rig- orously from βt in the forward process. Thus, our training procedure directly trains our sampler to match the data distribution after T steps: it trains the sampler as a latent variable model using variational inference. In contrast, NCSN’s sampler coefﬁcients are set by hand post-hoc, and their training procedure is not guaranteed to directly optimize a quality metric of their sampler. D Samples Additional samples Figure 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19 show uncurated samples from the diffusion models trained on CelebA-HQ, CIFAR10 and LSUN datasets. Latent structure and reverse process stochasticity During sampling, both the prior xT ∼ N(0,I) and Langevin dynamics are stochastic. To understand the signiﬁcance of the second source of noise, we sampled multiple images conditioned on the same intermediate latent for the CelebA 256 ×256 dataset. Figure 7 shows multiple draws from the reverse process x0 ∼pθ(x0|xt) that share the latent xt for t∈{1000,750,500,250}. To accomplish this, we run a single reverse chain from an initial draw from the prior. At the intermediate timesteps, the chain is split to sample multiple images. When the chain is split after the prior draw at xT=1000, the samples differ signiﬁcantly. However, when the chain is split after more steps, samples share high-level attributes like gender, hair color, eyewear, saturation, pose and facial expression. This indicates that intermediate latents like x750 encode these attributes, despite their imperceptibility. Coarse-to-ﬁne interpolation Figure 9 shows interpolations between a pair of source CelebA 256 ×256 images as we vary the number of diffusion steps prior to latent space interpolation. Increasing the number of diffusion steps destroys more structure in the source images, which the 15model completes during the reverse process. This allows us to interpolate at both ﬁne granularities and coarse granularities. In the limiting case of 0 diffusion steps, the interpolation mixes source images in pixel space. On the other hand, after 1000 diffusion steps, source information is lost and interpolations are novel samples. Source Rec. λ=0.1 λ=0.2 λ=0.3 λ=0.4 λ=0.5 λ=0.6 λ=0.7 λ=0.8 λ=0.9 Rec.

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a com- plex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient ﬁeld (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic mod- eling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efﬁciency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demon- strated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high ﬁdelity generation of 1024 ˆ1024 images for the ﬁrst time from a score-based generative model. 1 I NTRODUCTION Two successful classes of probabilistic generative models involve sequentially corrupting training data with slowly increasing noise, and then learning to reverse this corruption in order to form a generative model of the data. Score matching with Langevin dynamics (SMLD) (Song & Ermon, 2019) estimates the score (i.e., the gradient of the log probability density with respect to data) at each noise scale, and then uses Langevin dynamics to sample from a sequence of decreasing noise scales during generation. Denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) trains a sequence of probabilistic models to reverse each step of the noise corruption, using knowledge of the functional form of the reverse distributions to make training tractable. For continuous state spaces, the DDPM training objective implicitly computes scores at each noise scale. We therefore refer to these two model classes together as score-based generative models. Score-based generative models, and related techniques (Bordes et al., 2017; Goyal et al., 2017; Du & Mordatch, 2019), have proven effective at generation of images (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020; Ho et al., 2020), audio (Chen et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2020), graphs (Niu et al., 2020), and shapes (Cai ˚Work partially done during an internship at Google Brain. 1 arXiv:2011.13456v2  [cs.LG]  10 Feb 2021Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021        Forward SDE (data  →  noise)  Reverse SDE (noise →  data)  score function Figure 1: Solving a reverse- time SDE yields a score-based generative model. Transform- ing data to a simple noise dis- tribution can be accomplished with a continuous-time SDE. This SDE can be reversed if we know the score of the distribu- tion at each intermediate time step, ∇x log ptpxq. et al., 2020). To enable new sampling methods and further extend the capabilities of score-based generative models, we propose a uniﬁed framework that generalizes previous approaches through the lens of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Speciﬁcally, instead of perturbing data with a ﬁnite number of noise distributions, we consider a continuum of distributions that evolve over time according to a diffusion process. This process progressively diffuses a data point into random noise, and is given by a prescribed SDE that does not depend on the data and has no trainable parameters. By reversing this process, we can smoothly mold random noise into data for sample generation. Crucially, this reverse process satisﬁes a reverse-time SDE (Anderson, 1982), which can be derived from the forward SDE given the score of the marginal probability densities as a function of time. We can therefore approximate the reverse-time SDE by training a time-dependent neural network to estimate the scores, and then produce samples using numerical SDE solvers. Our key idea is summarized in Fig. 1. Our proposed framework has several theoretical and practical contributions: Flexible sampling and likelihood computation: We can employ any general-purpose SDE solver to integrate the reverse-time SDE for sampling. In addition, we propose two special methods not viable for general SDEs: (i) Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers that combine numerical SDE solvers with score-based MCMC approaches, such as Langevin MCMC (Parisi, 1981) and HMC (Neal et al., 2011); and (ii) deterministic samplers based on the probability ﬂow ordinary differential equation (ODE). The former uniﬁes and improves over existing sampling methods for score-based models. The latter allows for fast adaptive sampling via black-box ODE solvers, ﬂexible data manipulation via latent codes, a uniquely identiﬁable encoding, and notably, exact likelihood computation. Controllable generation: We can modulate the generation process by conditioning on information not available during training, because the conditional reverse-time SDE can be efﬁciently estimated from unconditional scores. This enables applications such as class-conditional generation, image inpainting, colorization and other inverse problems, all achievable using a single unconditional score-based model without re-training. Uniﬁed framework: Our framework provides a uniﬁed way to explore and tune various SDEs for improving score-based generative models. The methods of SMLD and DDPM can be amalgamated into our framework as discretizations of two separate SDEs. Although DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) was recently reported to achieve higher sample quality than SMLD (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020), we show that with better architectures and new sampling algorithms allowed by our framework, the latter can catch up—it achieves new state-of-the-art Inception score (9.89) and FID score (2.20) on CIFAR-10, as well as high-ﬁdelity generation of 1024 ˆ1024 images for the ﬁrst time from a score-based model. In addition, we propose a new SDE under our framework that achieves a likelihood value of 2.99 bits/dim on uniformly dequantized CIFAR-10 images, setting a new record on this task. 2 B ACKGROUND 2.1 D ENOISING SCORE MATCHING WITH LANGEVIN DYNAMICS (SMLD) Let pσp˜x |xq:“Np˜x; x,σ2Iqbe a perturbation kernel, andpσp˜xq:“ ş pdatapxqpσp˜x |xqdx, where pdatapxqdenotes the data distribution. Consider a sequence of positive noise scales σmin “σ1 ă σ2 ă¨¨¨ă σN “σmax. Typically, σmin is small enough such that pσmin pxq« pdatapxq, and σmax is 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 large enough such that pσmax pxq« Npx; 0,σ2 maxIq. Song & Ermon (2019) propose to train a Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN), denoted by sθpx,σq, with a weighted sum of denoising score matching (Vincent, 2011) objectives: θ˚ “arg min θ Nÿ i“1 σ2 iEpdatapxqEpσip˜x|xq “ ∥sθp˜x,σiq´ ∇˜x log pσip˜x |xq∥2 2 ‰ .

For each training data point x0 „ pdatapxq, a discrete Markov chain tx0,x1,¨¨¨ ,xNuis constructed such that ppxi |xi´1q“ Npxi; ?1 ´βixi´1,βiIq, and therefore pαipxi |x0q“ Npxi; ?αix0,p1 ´αiqIq, where αi :“śi j“1p1 ´βjq. Similar to SMLD, we can denote the perturbed data distribution as pαip˜xq:“ ş pdatapxqpαip˜x |xqdx. The noise scales are pre- scribed such that xN is approximately distributed according to Np0,Iq. A variational Markov chain in the reverse direction is parameterized withpθpxi´1|xiq“ Npxi´1; 1?1´βi pxi`βisθpxi,iqq,βiIq, and trained with a re-weighted variant of the evidence lower bound (ELBO): θ˚ “arg min θ Nÿ i“1 p1 ´αiqEpdatapxqEpαip˜x|xqr∥sθp˜x,iq´ ∇˜x log pαip˜x |xq∥2 2s. (3) After solving Eq.

(4) We call this method ancestral sampling, since it amounts to performing ancestral sampling from the graphical model śN i“1 pθpxi´1 |xiq. The objective Eq. (3) described here is Lsimple in Ho et al. (2020), written in a form to expose more similarity to Eq. (1). Like Eq. (1), Eq. (3) is also a weighted sum of denoising score matching objectives, which implies that the optimal model,sθ˚p˜x,iq, matches the score of the perturbed data distribution, ∇x log pαipxq. Notably, the weights of the i-th summand in Eq. (1) and Eq.

We propose to generalize this idea further to an inﬁnite number of noise scales, such that perturbed data distributions evolve according to an SDE as the noise intensiﬁes. An overview of our framework is given in Fig. 2. 3.1 P ERTURBING DATA WITH SDE S Our goal is to construct a diffusion processtxptquT t“0 indexed by a continuous time variabletPr0,Ts, such that xp0q„ p0, for which we have a dataset of i.i.d. samples, and xpTq„ pT, for which we have a tractable form to generate samples efﬁciently. In other words, p0 is the data distribution and pT is the prior distribution. This diffusion process can be modeled as the solution to an Itˆo SDE: dx “fpx,tqdt`gptqdw, (5) 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021      Forward SDEData Prior DataReverse SDE    Figure 2: Overview of score-based generative modeling through SDEs . We can map data to a noise distribution (the prior) with an SDE (Section 3.1), and reverse this SDE for generative modeling (Section 3.2). We can also reverse the associated probability ﬂow ODE (Section 4.3), which yields a deterministic process that samples from the same distribution as the SDE. Both the reverse-time SDE and probability ﬂow ODE can be obtained by estimating the score ∇x log ptpxq(Section 3.3). where w is the standard Wiener process (a.k.a., Brownian motion), fp¨,tq: Rd ÑRd is a vector- valued function called the drift coefﬁcient of xptq, and gp¨q: R ÑR is a scalar function known as the diffusion coefﬁcient of xptq. For ease of presentation we assume the diffusion coefﬁcient is a scalar (instead of a dˆdmatrix) and does not depend on x, but our theory can be generalized to hold in those cases (see Appendix A). The SDE has a unique strong solution as long as the coefﬁcients are globally Lipschitz in both state and time (Øksendal, 2003). We hereafter denote by ptpxqthe probability density of xptq, and use pstpxptq| xpsqqto denote the transition kernel from xpsqto xptq, where 0 ďsătďT. Typically, pT is an unstructured prior distribution that contains no information of p0, such as a Gaussian distribution with ﬁxed mean and variance. There are various ways of designing the SDE in Eq. (5) such that it diffuses the data distribution into a ﬁxed prior distribution. We provide several examples later in Section 3.4 that are derived from continuous generalizations of SMLD and DDPM. 3.2 G ENERATING SAMPLES BY REVERSING THE SDE By starting from samples of xpTq„ pT and reversing the process, we can obtain samples xp0q„ p0. A remarkable result from Anderson (1982) states that the reverse of a diffusion process is also a diffusion process, running backwards in time and given by the reverse-time SDE: dx “rfpx,tq´ gptq2∇x log ptpxqsdt`gptqd ¯w, (6) where ¯w is a standard Wiener process when time ﬂows backwards from T to 0, and dt is an inﬁnitesimal negative timestep. Once the score of each marginal distribution, ∇x log ptpxq, is known for all t, we can derive the reverse diffusion process from Eq. (6) and simulate it to sample from p0. 3.3 E STIMATING SCORES FOR THE SDE The score of a distribution can be estimated by training a score-based model on samples with score matching (Hyv ¨arinen, 2005; Song et al., 2019a). To estimate ∇x log ptpxq, we can train a time-dependent score-based model sθpx,tqvia a continuous generalization to Eqs. (1) and (3): θ˚ “arg min θ Et ! λptqExp0qExptq|xp0q “sθpxptq,tq´ ∇xptqlog p0tpxptq| xp0qq 2 2 ‰) . (7) Here λ : r0,Ts ÑRą0 is a positive weighting function, t is uniformly sampled over r0,Ts, xp0q„ p0pxqand xptq„ p0tpxptq| xp0qq. With sufﬁcient data and model capacity, score matching ensures that the optimal solution to Eq. (7), denoted by sθ˚px,tq, equals ∇x log ptpxqfor almost all x and t. As in SMLD and DDPM, we can typically choose λ91{E “∇xptqlog p0tpxptq| xp0qq 2 2 ‰ . Note that Eq. (7) uses denoising score matching, but other score matching objectives, such as sliced 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 score matching (Song et al., 2019a) and ﬁnite-difference score matching (Pang et al., 2020) are also applicable here. We typically need to know the transition kernelp0tpxptq| xp0qqto efﬁciently solve Eq. (7). When fp¨,tqis afﬁne, the transition kernel is always a Gaussian distribution, where the mean and variance are often known in closed-forms and can be obtained with standard techniques (see Section 5.5 in S¨arkk¨a & Solin (2019)). For more general SDEs, we may solve Kolmogorov’s forward equation (Øksendal, 2003) to obtain p0tpxptq| xp0qq. Alternatively, we can simulate the SDE to sample from p0tpxptq| xp0qqand replace denoising score matching in Eq. (7) with sliced score matching for model training, which bypasses the computation of ∇xptqlog p0tpxptq| xp0qq(see Appendix A). 3.4 E XAMPLES : VE, VP SDE S AND BEYOND The noise perturbations used in SMLD and DDPM can be regarded as discretizations of two different SDEs. Below we provide a brief discussion and relegate more details to Appendix B. When using a total of N noise scales, each perturbation kernel pσipx |x0qof SMLD corresponds to the distribution of xi in the following Markov chain: xi “xi´1 ` b σ2 i ´σ2 i´1zi´1, i “1,¨¨¨ ,N, (8) where zi´1 „Np0,Iq, and we have introduced σ0 “0 to simplify the notation. In the limit of N Ñ8, tσiuN i“1 becomes a function σptq, zi becomes zptq, and the Markov chain txiuN i“1 becomes a continuous stochastic process txptqu1 t“0, where we have used a continuous time variable tPr0,1s for indexing, rather than an integer i. The process txptqu1 t“0 is given by the following SDE dx “ c d rσ2ptqs dt dw. (9) Likewise for the perturbation kernels tpαipx |x0quN i“1 of DDPM, the discrete Markov chain is xi “ a 1 ´βixi´1 ` a βizi´1, i “1,¨¨¨ ,N. (10) As N Ñ8, Eq. (10) converges to the following SDE, dx “´ 1 2βptqx dt` a βptqdw. (11) Therefore, the noise perturbations used in SMLD and DDPM correspond to discretizations of SDEs Eqs. (9) and (11). Interestingly, the SDE of Eq. (9) always gives a process with exploding variance when tÑ8, whilst the SDE of Eq. (11) yields a process with a ﬁxed variance of one when the initial distribution has unit variance (proof in Appendix B). Due to this difference, we hereafter refer to Eq. (9) as the Variance Exploding (VE) SDE, and Eq. (11) the Variance Preserving (VP) SDE. Inspired by the VP SDE, we propose a new type of SDEs which perform particularly well on likelihoods (see Section 4.3), given by dx “´ 1 2βptqx dt` b βptqp1 ´e´2 şt 0 βpsqdsqdw. (12) When using the same βptqand starting from the same initial distribution, the variance of the stochastic process induced by Eq. (12) is always bounded by the VP SDE at every intermediate time step (proof in Appendix B). For this reason, we name Eq. (12) the sub-VP SDE. Since VE, VP and sub-VP SDEs all have afﬁne drift coefﬁcients, their perturbation kernels p0tpxptq| xp0qqare all Gaussian and can be computed in closed-forms, as discussed in Section 3.3. This makes training with Eq. (7) particularly efﬁcient. 4 S OLVING THE REVERSE SDE After training a time-dependent score-based model sθ, we can use it to construct the reverse-time SDE and then simulate it with numerical approaches to generate samples from p0. 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Table 1: Comparing different reverse-time SDE solvers on CIFAR-10.

Many general-purpose numerical methods exist for solving SDEs, such as Euler-Maruyama and stochastic Runge-Kutta methods (Kloe- den & Platen, 2013), which correspond to different discretizations of the stochastic dynamics. We can apply any of them to the reverse-time SDE for sample generation. Ancestral sampling, the sampling method of DDPM (Eq. (4)), actually corresponds to one special discretization of the reverse-time VP SDE (Eq. (11)) (see Appendix E). Deriving the ancestral sampling rules for new SDEs, however, can be non-trivial. To remedy this, we propose reverse diffusion samplers (details in Appendix E), which discretize the reverse-time SDE in the same way as the forward one, and thus can be readily derived given the forward discretization. As shown in Table 1, reverse diffusion samplers perform slightly better than ancestral sampling for both SMLD and DDPM models on CIFAR-10 (DDPM-type ancestral sampling is also applicable to SMLD models, see Appendix F.) 4.2 P REDICTOR -CORRECTOR SAMPLERS Unlike generic SDEs, we have additional information that can be used to improve solutions. Since we have a score-based model sθ˚px,tq« ∇x log ptpxq, we can employ score-based MCMC approaches, such as Langevin MCMC (Parisi, 1981; Grenander & Miller, 1994) or HMC (Neal et al., 2011) to sample from pt directly, and correct the solution of a numerical SDE solver. Speciﬁcally, at each time step, the numerical SDE solver ﬁrst gives an estimate of the sample at the next time step, playing the role of a “predictor”. Then, the score-based MCMC approach corrects the marginal distribution of the estimated sample, playing the role of a “corrector”. The idea is analogous to Predictor-Corrector methods, a family of numerical continuation techniques for solving systems of equations (Allgower & Georg, 2012), and we similarly name our hybrid sampling algorithms Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers. Please ﬁnd pseudo-code and a complete description in Appendix G. PC samplers generalize the original sampling methods of SMLD and DDPM: the former uses an identity function as the predictor and annealed Langevin dynamics as the corrector, while the latter uses ancestral sampling as the predictor and identity as the corrector. We test PC samplers on SMLD and DDPM models (see Algorithms 2 and 3 in Appendix G) trained with original discrete objectives given by Eqs. (1) and (3). This exhibits the compatibility of PC samplers to score-based models trained with a ﬁxed number of noise scales. We summarize the performance of different samplers in Table 1, where probability ﬂow is a predictor to be discussed in Section 4.3. Detailed experimental settings and additional results are given in Appendix G. We observe that our reverse diffusion sampler always outperform ancestral sampling, and corrector-only methods (C2000) perform worse than other competitors (P2000, PC1000) with the same computation (In fact, we need way more corrector steps per noise scale, and thus more computation, to match the performance of other samplers.) For all predictors, adding one corrector step for each predictor step (PC1000) doubles computation but always improves sample quality (against P1000). Moreover, it is typically better than doubling the number of predictor steps without adding a corrector (P2000), where we have to interpolate between noise scales in an ad hoc manner (detailed in Appendix G) for SMLD/DDPM models. In Fig. 9 (Appendix G), we additionally provide qualitative comparison for 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Table 2: NLLs and FIDs (ODE) on CIFAR-10.

For all diffusion processes, there exists a corresponding deterministic process whose trajectories share the same marginal probability densities tptpxquT t“0 as the SDE. This deterministic process satisﬁes an ODE (more details in Appendix D.1): dx “ ” fpx,tq´ 1 2gptq2∇x log ptpxq ı dt, (13) which can be determined from the SDE once scores are known. We name the ODE in Eq. (13) the probability ﬂow ODE. When the score function is approximated by the time-dependent score-based model, which is typically a neural network, this is an example of a neural ODE (Chen et al., 2018). Exact likelihood computation Leveraging the connection to neural ODEs, we can compute the density deﬁned by Eq. (13) via the instantaneous change of variables formula (Chen et al., 2018). This allows us to compute the exact likelihood on any input data (details in Appendix D.2). As an example, we report negative log-likelihoods (NLLs) measured in bits/dim on the CIFAR-10 dataset in Table 2. We compute log-likelihoods on uniformly dequantized data, and only compare to models evaluated in the same way (omitting models evaluated with variational dequantization (Ho et al., 2019) or discrete data), except for DDPM ( L/Lsimple) whose ELBO values (annotated with *) are reported on discrete data. Main results: (i) For the same DDPM model in Ho et al. (2020), we obtain better bits/dim than ELBO, since our likelihoods are exact; (ii) Using the same architecture, we trained another DDPM model with the continuous objective in Eq. (7) ( i.e., DDPM cont.), which further improves the likelihood; (iii) With sub-VP SDEs, we always get higher likelihoods compared to VP SDEs; (iv) With improved architecture (i.e., DDPM++ cont., details in Section 4.4) and the sub-VP SDE, we can set a new record bits/dim of 2.99 on uniformly dequantized CIFAR-10 even without maximum likelihood training. Manipulating latent representations By integrating Eq. (13), we can encode any datapoint xp0q into a latent space xpTq. Decoding can be achieved by integrating a corresponding ODE for the reverse-time SDE. As is done with other invertible models such as neural ODEs and normalizing ﬂows (Dinh et al., 2016; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), we can manipulate this latent representation for image editing, such as interpolation, and temperature scaling (see Fig. 3 and Appendix D.4). Uniquely identiﬁable encoding Unlike most current invertible models, our encoding is uniquely identiﬁable, meaning that with sufﬁcient training data, model capacity, and optimization accuracy, the encoding for an input is uniquely determined by the data distribution (Roeder et al., 2020). This is because our forward SDE, Eq. (5), has no trainable parameters, and its associated probability ﬂow 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 100 101 102 103 Evaluation number 0.0 0.5 1.0Evaluation timepoint ODE Evaluation Points Precision 1e-1 1e-3 1e-5 NFE=14    NFE=86    NFE=548     Interpolation Figure 3: Probability ﬂow ODE enables fast sampling with adaptive stepsizes as the numerical precision is varied (left), and reduces the number of score function evaluations (NFE) without harming quality (middle). The invertible mapping from latents to images allows for interpolations (right). ODE, Eq. (13), provides the same trajectories given perfectly estimated scores. We provide additional empirical veriﬁcation on this property in Appendix D.5. Efﬁcient sampling As with neural ODEs, we can sample xp0q „p0 by solving Eq. (13) from different ﬁnal conditions xpTq„ pT. Using a ﬁxed discretization strategy we can generate com- petitive samples, especially when used in conjuction with correctors (Table 1, “probability ﬂow sampler”, details in Appendix D.3). Using a black-box ODE solver (Dormand & Prince, 1980) not only produces high quality samples (Table 2, details in Appendix D.4), but also allows us to explicitly trade-off accuracy for efﬁciency. With a larger error tolerance, the number of function evaluations can be reduced by over 90% without affecting the visual quality of samples (Fig. 3). 4.4 A RCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS We explore several new architecture designs for score-based models using both VE and VP SDEs (details in Appendix H), where we train models with the same discrete objectives as in SMLD/DDPM. We directly transfer the architectures for VP SDEs to sub-VP SDEs due to their similarity. Our optimal architecture for the VE SDE, named NCSN++, achieves an FID of 2.45 on CIFAR-10 with PC samplers, while our optimal architecture for the VP SDE, called DDPM++, achieves 2.78. By switching to the continuous training objective in Eq. (7), and increasing the network depth, we can further improve sample quality for all models. The resulting architectures are denoted as NCSN++ cont. and DDPM++ cont. in Table 3 for VE and VP/sub-VP SDEs respectively. Results reported in Table 3 are for the checkpoint with the smallest FID over the course of training, where samples are generated with PC samplers. In contrast, FID scores and NLL values in Table 2 are reported for the last training checkpoint, and samples are obtained with black-box ODE solvers. As shown in Table 3, VE SDEs typically provide better sample quality than VP/sub-VP SDEs, but we also empirically observe that their likelihoods are worse than VP/sub-VP SDE counterparts. This indicates that practitioners likely need to experiment with different SDEs for varying domains and architectures. Our best model for sample quality, NCSN++ cont. (deep, VE), doubles the network depth and sets new records for both inception score and FID on unconditional generation for CIFAR-10. Surprisingly, we can achieve better FID than the previous best conditional generative model without requiring labeled data. With all improvements together, we also obtain the ﬁrst set of high-ﬁdelity samples on CelebA-HQ 1024 ˆ1024 from score-based models (see Appendix H.3). Our best model for likelihoods, DDPM++ cont. (deep, sub-VP), similarly doubles the network depth and achieves a log-likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim with the continuous objective in Eq. (7). To our best knowledge, this is the highest likelihood on uniformly dequantized CIFAR-10. 5 C ONTROLLABLE GENERATION The continuous structure of our framework allows us to not only produce data samples from p0, but also from p0pxp0q| yqif ptpy |xptqqis known. Given a forward SDE as in Eq. (5), we can sample 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Figure 4: Left: Class-conditional samples on 32 ˆ32 CIFAR-10. Top four rows are automobiles and bottom four rows are horses. Right: Inpainting (top two rows) and colorization (bottom two rows) results on 256 ˆ256 LSUN.

(14) In general, we can use Eq. (14) to solve a large family ofinverse problemswith score-based generative models, once given an estimate of the gradient of the forward process, ∇x log ptpy |xptqq. In some cases, it is possible to train a separate model to learn the forward process log ptpy | xptqqand compute its gradient. Otherwise, we may estimate the gradient with heuristics and domain knowledge. In Appendix I.4, we provide a broadly applicable method for obtaining such an estimate without the need of training auxiliary models. We consider three applications of controllable generation with this approach: class-conditional generation, image imputation and colorization. When y represents class labels, we can train a time-dependent classiﬁer ptpy | xptqqfor class-conditional sampling. Since the forward SDE is tractable, we can easily create training data pxptq,yqfor the time-dependent classiﬁer by ﬁrst sampling pxp0q,yqfrom a dataset, and then sampling xptq „p0tpxptq |xp0qq. Afterwards, we may employ a mixture of cross-entropy losses over different time steps, like Eq. (7), to train the time-dependent classiﬁer ptpy |xptqq. We provide class-conditional CIFAR-10 samples in Fig. 4 (left), and relegate more details and results to Appendix I. Imputation is a special case of conditional sampling. Suppose we have an incomplete data point y where only some subset, Ωpyqis known. Imputation amounts to sampling from ppxp0q| Ωpyqq, which we can accomplish using an unconditional model (see Appendix I.2). Colorization is a special case of imputation, except that the known data dimensions are coupled. We can decouple these data dimensions with an orthogonal linear transformation, and perform imputation in the transformed space (details in Appendix I.3). Fig. 4 (right) shows results for inpainting and colorization achieved with unconditional time-dependent score-based models. 6 C ONCLUSION We presented a framework for score-based generative modeling based on SDEs. Our work enables a better understanding of existing approaches, new sampling algorithms, exact likelihood computation, uniquely identiﬁable encoding, latent code manipulation, and brings new conditional generation abilities to the family of score-based generative models. While our proposed sampling approaches improve results and enable more efﬁcient sampling, they remain slower at sampling than GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) on the same datasets. Identifying ways of combining the stable learning of score-based generative models with the fast sampling of implicit models like GANs remains an important research direction. Additionally, the breadth of samplers one can use when given access to score functions introduces a number of hyper-parameters. Future work would beneﬁt from improved methods to automatically select and tune these hyper- parameters, as well as more extensive investigation on the merits and limitations of various samplers. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Nanxin Chen, Ruiqi Gao, Jonathan Ho, Kevin Murphy, Tim Salimans and Han Zhang for their insightful discussions during the course of this project.

Our framework allows general SDEs with matrix-valued diffusion coefﬁcients that depend on the state, for which we provide a detailed discussion in Appendix A. We give a full derivation of VE, VP and sub-VP SDEs in Appendix B, and discuss how to use them from a practitioner’s perspective in Appendix C. We elaborate on the probability ﬂow formulation of our framework in Appendix D, including a derivation of the probability ﬂow ODE (Appendix D.1), exact likelihood computation (Appendix D.2), probability ﬂow sampling with a ﬁxed discretization strategy (Appendix D.3), sampling with black- box ODE solvers (Appendix D.4), and experimental veriﬁcation on uniquely identiﬁable encoding (Appendix D.5). We give a full description of the reverse diffusion sampler in Appendix E, the DDPM-type ancestral sampler for SMLD models in Appendix F, and Predictor-Corrector samplers in Appendix G. We explain our model architectures and detailed experimental settings in Appendix H, with 1024 ˆ1024 CelebA-HQ samples therein. Finally, we detail on the algorithms for controllable generation in Appendix I, and include extended results for class-conditional generation (Appendix I.1), image inpainting (Appendix I.2), colorization (Appendix I.3), and a strategy for solving general inverse problems (Appendix I.4). A T HE FRAMEWORK FOR MORE GENERAL SDE S In the main text, we introduced our framework based on a simpliﬁed SDE Eq. (5) where the diffusion coefﬁcient is independent of xptq. It turns out that our framework can be extended to hold for more general diffusion coefﬁcients. We can consider SDEs in the following form: dx “fpx,tqdt`Gpx,tqdw, (15) where fp¨,tq : Rd Ñ Rd and Gp¨,tq : Rd Ñ Rdˆd. We follow the It ˆo interpretation of SDEs throughout this paper. According to (Anderson, 1982), the reverse-time SDE is given by (cf ., Eq.

The probability ﬂow ODE corresponding to Eq. (15) has the following form ( cf ., Eq.

(18) When the drift and diffusion coefﬁcient of an SDE are not afﬁne, it can be difﬁcult to compute the transition kernel p0tpxptq| xp0qqin closed form. This hinders the training of score-based models, because Eq. (7) requires knowing ∇xptqlog p0tpxptq| xp0qq. To overcome this difﬁculty, we can replace denoising score matching in Eq. (7) with other efﬁcient variants of score matching that do not require computing ∇xptqlog p0tpxptq| xp0qq. For example, when using sliced score matching (Song et al., 2019a), our training objective Eq. (7) becomes θ˚ “arg min θ Et \" λptqExp0qExptqEv„pv „1 2 ∥sθpxptq,tq∥2 2 `vTsθpxptq,tqv * , (19) where λ: r0,TsÑ R` is a positive weighting function, t„Up0,Tq, Ervs“ 0, and Covrvs“ I. We can always simulate the SDE to sample from p0tpxptq| xp0qq, and solve Eq. (19) to train the time-dependent score-based model sθpx,tq. 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 B VE, VP AND SUB -VP SDE S Below we provide detailed derivations to show that the noise perturbations of SMLD and DDPM are discretizations of the Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) SDEs respectively. We additionally introduce sub-VP SDEs, a modiﬁcation to VP SDEs that often achieves better performance in both sample quality and likelihoods. First, when using a total of N noise scales, each perturbation kernel pσipx |x0qof SMLD can be derived from the following Markov chain: xi “xi´1 ` b σ2 i ´σ2 i´1zi´1, i “1,¨¨¨ ,N, (20) where zi´1 „Np0,Iq, x0 „pdata, and we have introduced σ0 “0 to simplify the notation. In the limit of N Ñ 8, the Markov chain txiuN i“1 becomes a continuous stochastic process txptqu1 t“0, tσiuN i“1 becomes a functionσptq, and zibecomes zptq, where we have used a continuous time variable t P r0,1sfor indexing, rather than an integer i P t1,2,¨¨¨ ,Nu. Let x ` i N ˘ “ xi, σ ` i N ˘ “ σi, and z ` i N ˘ “ zi for i “ 1,2,¨¨¨ ,N. We can rewrite Eq. (20) as follows with ∆t “ 1 N and tP ␣ 0, 1 N,¨¨¨ ,N´1 N ( : xpt`∆tq“ xptq` a σ2pt`∆tq´ σ2ptqzptq« xptq` c d rσ2ptqs dt ∆tzptq, where the approximate equality holds when ∆t!1. In the limit of ∆tÑ0, this converges to dx “ c d rσ2ptqs dt dw, (21) which is the VE SDE. For the perturbation kernels tpαipx |x0quN i“1 used in DDPM, the discrete Markov chain is xi “ a 1 ´βixi´1 ` a βizi´1, i “1,¨¨¨ ,N, (22) where zi´1 „ Np0,Iq. To obtain the limit of this Markov chain when N Ñ 8, we deﬁne an auxiliary set of noise scales t¯βi “NβiuN i“1, and re-write Eq. (22) as below xi “ c 1 ´ ¯βi Nxi´1 ` c ¯βi Nzi´1, i “1,¨¨¨ ,N. (23) In the limit of N Ñ8, t¯βiuN i“1 becomes a function βptqindexed by t Pr0,1s. Let β ` i N ˘ “ ¯βi, xpi Nq“ xi, zpi Nq“ zi. We can rewrite the Markov chain Eq. (23) as the following with∆t“ 1 N and tPt0,1,¨¨¨ ,N´1 N u: xpt`∆tq“ a 1 ´βpt`∆tq∆txptq` a βpt`∆tq∆tzptq «xptq´ 1 2βpt`∆tq∆txptq` a βpt`∆tq∆tzptq «xptq´ 1 2βptq∆txptq` a βptq∆tzptq, (24) where the approximate equality holds when ∆t !1. Therefore, in the limit of ∆t Ñ0, Eq. (24) converges to the following VP SDE: dx “´ 1 2βptqx dt` a βptqdw. (25) So far, we have demonstrated that the noise perturbations used in SMLD and DDPM correspond to discretizations of VE and VP SDEs respectively. The VE SDE always yields a process with exploding variance when tÑ8. In contrast, the VP SDE yields a process with bounded variance. In addition, the process has a constant unit variance for all tPr0,8qwhen ppxp0qqhas a unit variance. Since the VP SDE has afﬁne drift and diffusion coefﬁcients, we can use Eq. (5.51) in S¨arkk¨a & Solin (2019) to obtain an ODE that governs the evolution of variance dΣVPptq dt “βptqpI ´ΣVPptqq, 14Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 where ΣVPptq:“Covrxptqsfor txptqu1 t“0 obeying a VP SDE. Solving this ODE, we obtain ΣVPptq“ I `e şt 0 ´βpsqdspΣVPp0q´ Iq, (26) from which it is clear that the varianceΣVPptqis always bounded givenΣVPp0q. Moreover, ΣVPptq” I if ΣVPp0q“ I. Due to this difference, we name Eq. (9) as the Variance Exploding (VE) SDE, and Eq. (11) the Variance Preserving (VP) SDE. Inspired by the VP SDE, we propose a new SDE called the sub-VP SDE, namely dx “´ 1 2βptqx dt` b βptqp1 ´e´2 şt 0 βpsqdsqdw. (27) Following standard derivations, it is straightforward to show thatErxptqsis the same for both VP and sub-VP SDEs; the variance function of sub-VP SDEs is different, given by Σsub-VPptq“ I `e´2 şt 0 βpsqdsI `e´ şt 0 βpsqdspΣsub-VPp0q´ 2Iq, (28) where Σsub-VPptq:“Covrxptqsfor a process txptqu1 t“0 obtained by solving Eq. (27). In addition, we observe that (i) Σsub-VPptqď ΣVPptqfor all tě0 with Σsub-VPp0q“ ΣVPp0qand shared βpsq; and (ii) limtÑ8Σsub-VPptq“ limtÑ8ΣVPptq“ I if limtÑ8 şt 0 βpsqds“8. The former is why we name Eq. (27) the sub-VP SDE—its variance is always upper bounded by the corresponding VP SDE. The latter justiﬁes the use of sub-VP SDEs for score-based generative modeling, since they can perturb any data distribution to standard Gaussian under suitable conditions, just like VP SDEs. VE, VP and sub-VP SDEs all have afﬁne drift coefﬁcients. Therefore, their perturbation kernels p0tpxptq| xp0qqare all Gaussian and can be computed with Eqs. (5.50) and (5.51) in S¨arkk¨a & Solin (2019): p0tpxptq| xp0qq“ $ ’& ’% N ` xptq; xp0q,rσ2ptq´ σ2p0qsI ˘ , (VE SDE) N ` xptq; xp0qe´1 2 şt 0 βpsqds,I ´Ie´ şt 0 βpsqds˘ (VP SDE) N ` xptq; xp0qe´1 2 şt 0 βpsqds,r1 ´e´ şt 0 βpsqdss2I ˘ (sub-VP SDE) . (29) As a result, all SDEs introduced here can be efﬁciently trained with the objective in Eq. (7). C SDE S IN THE WILD Below we discuss concrete instantiations of VE and VP SDEs whose discretizations yield SMLD and DDPM models, and the speciﬁc sub-VP SDE used in our experiments. In SMLD, the noise scales tσiuN i“1 is typically a geometric sequence where σmin is ﬁxed to 0.01 and σmax is chosen according to Technique 1 in Song & Ermon (2020). Usually, SMLD models normalize image inputs to the range r0,1s. Since tσiuN i“1 is a geometric sequence, we have σpi Nq“ σi “σmin ´ σmax σmin ¯ i´1 N´1 for i “ 1,2,¨¨¨ ,N. In the limit of N Ñ 8, we have σptq “σmin ´ σmax σmin ¯t for t P p0,1s. The corresponding VE SDE is dx “σmin ˆσmax σmin ˙tc 2 log σmax σmin dw, t Pp0,1s, (30) and the perturbation kernel can be derived via Eq. (29): p0tpxptq| xp0qq“ N ˆ xptq; xp0q,σ2 min ´σmax σmin ¯2t I ˙ , t Pp0,1s. (31) There is one subtlety whent“0: by deﬁnition, σp0q“ σ0 “0 (following the convention in Eq. (20)), but σp0`q:“limtÑ0` σptq“ σmin ‰0. In other words, σptqfor SMLD is not differentiable since σp0q‰ σp0`q, causing the VE SDE in Eq. (21) undeﬁned for t“0. In practice, we bypass this issue by always solving the SDE and its associated probability ﬂow ODE in the range tPrϵ,1sfor some small constant ϵą0, and we use ϵ“10´5 in our VE SDE experiments. 15Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 t 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500Variance Variance of Perturbation Kernels SMLD original VE SDE (a) SMLD 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 t 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Scaling Factor of Means Mean of Perturbation Kernels DDPM original VP SDE (b) DDPM (mean) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 t 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Variance Variance of Perturbation Kernels DDPM original VP SDE (c) DDPM (variance) Figure 5: Discrete-time perturbation kernels and our continuous generalizations match each other almost exactly. (a) compares the variance of perturbation kernels for SMLD and VE SDE; (b) compares the scaling factors of means of perturbation kernels for DDPM and VP SDE; and (c) compares the variance of perturbation kernels for DDPM and VP SDE. For DDPM models, tβiuN i“1 is typically an arithmetic sequence where βi “ ¯βmin N ` i´1 NpN´1qp¯βmax ´ ¯βminqfor i “1,2,¨¨¨ ,N. Therefore, βptq “¯βmin `tp¯βmax ´ ¯βminqfor t P r0,1sin the limit of N Ñ8. This corresponds to the following instantiation of the VP SDE: dx “´ 1 2p¯βmin `tp¯βmax ´¯βminqqxdt` b ¯βmin `tp¯βmax ´¯βminqdw, t Pr0,1s, (32) where xp0q„ pdatapxq. In our experiments, we let ¯βmin “0.1 and ¯βmax “20 to match the settings in Ho et al. (2020). The perturbation kernel is given by p0tpxptq| xp0qq “N ´ xptq; e´1 4 t2p¯βmax´¯βminq´1 2 t¯βmin xp0q,I ´Ie´1 2 t2p¯βmax´¯βminq´t¯βmin ¯ , t Pr0,1s. (33) For DDPM, there is no discontinuity issue with the corresponding VP SDE; yet, there are numerical instability issues for training and sampling at t“0, due to the vanishing variance of xptqas tÑ0. Therefore, same as the VE SDE, we restrict computation to tPrϵ,1sfor a small ϵą0. For sampling, we choose ϵ“10´3 so that the variance of xpϵqin VP SDE matches the variance of x1 in DDPM; for training and likelihood computation, we adopt ϵ“10´5 which empirically gives better results. As a sanity check for our SDE generalizations to SMLD and DDPM, we compare the perturbation kernels of SDEs and original discrete Markov chains in Fig. 5. The SMLD and DDPM models both use N “1000 noise scales. For SMLD, we only need to compare the variances of perturbation kernels since means are the same by deﬁnition. For DDPM, we compare the scaling factors of means and the variances. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the discrete perturbation kernels of original SMLD and DDPM models align well with perturbation kernels derived from VE and VP SDEs. For sub-VP SDEs, we use exactly the sameβptqas VP SDEs. This leads to the following perturbation kernel p0tpxptq| xp0qq “N ´ xptq; e´1 4 t2p¯βmax´¯βminq´1 2 t¯βmin xp0q,r1 ´e´1 2 t2p¯βmax´¯βminq´t¯βmin s2I ¯ , t Pr0,1s. (34) We also restrict numerical computation to the same interval of rϵ,1sas VP SDEs. Empirically, we observe that smaller ϵgenerally yields better likelihood values for all SDEs. For sampling, it is important to use an appropriate ϵ for better Inception scores and FIDs, although samples across different ϵlook visually the same to human eyes. D P ROBABILITY FLOW ODE D.1 D ERIVATION The idea of probability ﬂow ODE is inspired by Maoutsa et al. (2020), and one can ﬁnd the derivation of a simpliﬁed case therein. Below we provide a derivation for the fully general ODE in Eq. (17). We 16Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 consider the SDE in Eq. (15), which possesses the following form: dx “fpx,tqdt`Gpx,tqdw, where fp¨,tq : Rd Ñ Rd and Gp¨,tq : Rd Ñ Rdˆd.

(36) to obtain Bptpxq Bt “´ dÿ i“1 B Bxi rfipx,tqptpxqs` 1 2 dÿ i“1 B Bxi ” dÿ j“1 B Bxj ” dÿ k“1 Gikpx,tqGjkpx,tqptpxq ıı “´ dÿ i“1 B Bxi rfipx,tqptpxqs `1 2 dÿ i“1 B Bxi ” ptpxq∇ ¨rGpx,tqGpx,tqTs` ptpxqGpx,tqGpx,tqT∇x log ptpxq ı “´ dÿ i“1 B Bxi ! fipx,tqptpxq ´1 2 ” ∇ ¨rGpx,tqGpx,tqTs` Gpx,tqGpx,tqT∇x log ptpxq ı ptpxq ) “´ dÿ i“1 B Bxi r˜fipx,tqptpxqs, (37) where we deﬁne ˜fpx,tq:“fpx,tq´ 1 2∇ ¨rGpx,tqGpx,tqTs´ 1 2Gpx,tqGpx,tqT∇x log ptpxq. Inspecting Eq. (37), we observe that it equals Kolmogorov’s forward equation of the following SDE with ˜Gpx,tq:“0 (Kolmogorov’s forward equation in this case is also known as the Liouville equation.) dx “˜fpx,tqdt` ˜Gpx,tqdw, which is essentially an ODE: dx “˜fpx,tqdt, same as the probability ﬂow ODE given by Eq. (17). Therefore, we have shown that the probability ﬂow ODE Eq. (17) induces the same marginal probability density ptpxqas the SDE in Eq. (15). 17Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 D.2 L IKELIHOOD COMPUTATION The probability ﬂow ODE in Eq. (17) has the following form when we replace the score∇x log ptpxq with the time-dependent score-based model sθpx,tq: dx “ \" fpx,tq´ 1 2∇ ¨rGpx,tqGpx,tqTs´ 1 2Gpx,tqGpx,tqTsθpx,tq * loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooomoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon “:˜fθpx,tq dt. (38) With the instantaneous change of variables formula (Chen et al., 2018), we can compute the log- likelihood of p0pxqusing log p0pxp0qq“ log pTpxpTqq` żT 0 ∇ ¨˜fθpxptq,tqdt, (39) where the random variable xptqas a function of tcan be obtained by solving the probability ﬂow ODE in Eq. (38). In many cases computing ∇ ¨˜fθpx,tqis expensive, so we follow Grathwohl et al. (2018) to estimate it with the Skilling-Hutchinson trace estimator (Skilling, 1989; Hutchinson, 1990). In particular, we have ∇ ¨˜fθpx,tq“ EppϵqrϵT∇˜fθpx,tqϵs, (40) where ∇˜fθ denotes the Jacobian of ˜fθp¨,tq, and the random variable ϵ satisﬁes Eppϵqrϵs“ 0 and Covppϵqrϵs“ I. The vector-Jacobian product ϵT∇˜fθpx,tqcan be efﬁciently computed using reverse- mode automatic differentiation, at approximately the same cost as evaluating ˜fθpx,tq. As a result, we can sample ϵ „ ppϵqand then compute an efﬁcient unbiased estimate to ∇ ¨˜fθpx,tqusing ϵT∇˜fθpx,tqϵ. Since this estimator is unbiased, we can attain an arbitrarily small error by averaging over a sufﬁcient number of runs. Therefore, by applying the Skilling-Hutchinson estimator Eq. (40) to Eq. (39), we can compute the log-likelihood to any accuracy. In our experiments, we use the RK45 ODE solver (Dormand & Prince, 1980) provided by scipy.integrate.solve_ivp in all cases. The bits/dim values in Table 2 are computed with atol=1e-5 and rtol=1e-5, same as Grathwohl et al. (2018). To give the likelihood results of our models in Table 2, we average the bits/dim obtained on the test dataset over ﬁve different runs with ϵ“10´5 (see deﬁnition of ϵin Appendix C). D.3 P ROBABILITY FLOW SAMPLING Suppose we have a forward SDE dx “fpx,tqdt`Gptqdw, and one of its discretization xi`1 “xi `fipxiq` Gizi, i “0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1, (41) where zi „Np0,Iq. We assume the discretization schedule of time is ﬁxed beforehand, and thus we absorb the dependency on ∆tinto the notations of fi and Gi. Using Eq. (17), we can obtain the following probability ﬂow ODE: dx “ \" fpx,tq´ 1 2GptqGptqT∇x log ptpxq * dt. (42) We may employ any numerical method to integrate the probability ﬂow ODE backwards in time for sample generation. In particular, we propose a discretization in a similar functional form to Eq. (41): xi “xi`1 ´fi`1pxi`1q` 1 2Gi`1GT i`1sθ˚pxi`1,i `1q, i “0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1, where the score-based model sθ˚pxi,iqis conditioned on the iteration number i. This is a determin- istic iteration rule. Unlike reverse diffusion samplers or ancestral sampling, there is no additional randomness once the initial sample xN is obtained from the prior distribution. When applied to SMLD models, we can get the following iteration rule for probability ﬂow sampling: xi “xi`1 `1 2pσ2 i`1 ´σ2 iqsθ˚pxi`1,σi`1q, i “0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1. (43) Similarly, for DDPM models, we have xi “p2 ´ a 1 ´βi`1qxi`1 `1 2βi`1sθ˚pxi`1,i `1q, i “0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1. (44) 18Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 D.4 S AMPLING WITH BLACK -BOX ODE SOLVERS For producing ﬁgures in Fig. 3, we use a DDPM model trained on 256 ˆ256 CelebA-HQ with the same settings in Ho et al. (2020). All FID scores of our models in Table 2 are computed on samples from the RK45 ODE solver implemented inscipy.integrate.solve_ivp with atol=1e-5 and rtol=1e-5. We use ϵ“10´5 for VE SDEs and ϵ“10´3 for VP SDEs (see also Appendix C). Aside from the interpolation results in Fig. 3, we demonstrate more examples of latent space manipulation in Fig. 6, including interpolation and temperature scaling. The model tested here is a DDPM model trained with the same settings in Ho et al. (2020). Although solvers for the probability ﬂow ODE allow fast sampling, their samples typically have higher (worse) FID scores than those from SDE solvers if no corrector is used. We have this empirical observation for both the discretization strategy in Appendix D.3, and black-box ODE solvers introduced above. Moreover, the performance of probability ﬂow ODE samplers depends on the choice of the SDE—their sample quality for VE SDEs is much worse than VP SDEs especially for high-dimensional data. D.5 U NIQUELY IDENTIFIABLE ENCODING As a sanity check, we train two models (denoted as “Model A” and “Model B”) with different architectures using the VE SDE on CIFAR-10. Here Model A is an NCSN++ model with 4 layers per resolution trained using the continuous objective in Eq. (7), and Model B is all the same except that it uses 8 layers per resolution. Model deﬁnitions are in Appendix H. We report the latent codes obtained by Model A and Model B for a random CIFAR-10 image in Fig. 7. In Fig. 8, we show the dimension-wise differences and correlation coefﬁcients between latent encodings on a total of 16 CIFAR-10 images. Our results demonstrate that for the same inputs, Model A and Model B provide encodings that are close in every dimension, despite having different model architectures and training runs. E R EVERSE DIFFUSION SAMPLING Given a forward SDE dx “fpx,tqdt`Gptqdw, and suppose the following iteration rule is a discretization of it: xi`1 “xi `fipxiq` Gizi, i “0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1 (45) where zi „Np0,Iq. Here we assume the discretization schedule of time is ﬁxed beforehand, and thus we can absorb it into the notations of fi and Gi. Based on Eq. (45), we propose to discretize the reverse-time SDE dx “rfpx,tq´ GptqGptqT∇x log ptpxqsdt`Gptqd ¯w, with a similar functional form, which gives the following iteration rule for iPt0,1,¨¨¨ ,N ´1u: xi “xi`1 ´fi`1pxi`1q` Gi`1GT i`1sθ˚pxi`1,i `1q` Gi`1zi`1, (46) where our trained score-based model sθ˚pxi,iqis conditioned on iteration number i. When applying Eq. (46) to Eqs. (10) and (20), we obtain a new set of numerical solvers for the reverse-time VE and VP SDEs, resulting in sampling algorithms as shown in the “predictor” part of Algorithms 2 and 3. We name these sampling methods (that are based on the discretization strategy in Eq. (46)) reverse diffusion samplers. As expected, the ancestral sampling of DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) (Eq. (4)) matches its reverse diffusion counterpart when βi Ñ0 for all i(which happens when ∆tÑ0 since βi “ ¯βi∆t, see Appendix B), 19Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Figure 6: Samples from the probability ﬂow ODE for VP SDE on 256 ˆ256 CelebA-HQ.

Therefore, the original ancestral sampler of Eq. (4) is essentially a different discretization to the same reverse-time SDE. This uniﬁes the sampling method in Ho et al. (2020) as a numerical solver to the reverse-time VP SDE in our continuous framework. F A NCESTRAL SAMPLING FOR SMLD MODELS The ancestral sampling method for DDPM models can also be adapted to SMLD models. Consider a sequence of noise scales σ1 ăσ2 ă¨¨¨ă σN as in SMLD.

G P REDICTOR -CORRECTOR SAMPLERS Predictor-Corrector (PC) sampling The predictor can be any numerical solver for the reverse- time SDE with a ﬁxed discretization strategy. The corrector can be any score-based MCMC approach. In PC sampling, we alternate between the predictor and corrector, as described in Algorithm 1. For example, when using the reverse diffusion SDE solver (Appendix E) as the predictor, and annealed Langevin dynamics (Song & Ermon, 2019) as the corrector, we have Algorithms 2 and 3 for VE and VP SDEs respectively, where tϵiuN´1 i“0 are step sizes for Langevin dynamics as speciﬁed below. The corrector algorithms We take the schedule of annealed Langevin dynamics in Song & Ermon (2019), but re-frame it with slight modiﬁcations in order to get better interpretability and empirical performance. We provide the corrector algorithms in Algorithms 4 and 5 respectively, where we call rthe “signal-to-noise” ratio. We determine the step sizeϵusing the norm of the Gaussian noise ∥z∥2, norm of the score-based model ∥sθ˚∥2 and the signal-to-noise ratio r. When sampling a large batch of samples together, we replace the norm ∥¨∥2 with the average norm across the mini-batch. When the batch size is small, we suggest replacing ∥z∥2 with ? d, where dis the dimensionality of z. 22Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Algorithm 2 PC sampling (VE SDE) 1: xN „Np0,σ2 maxIq 2: for i“N ´1 to 0 do 3: x1 i Ðxi`1 `pσ2 i`1 ´σ2 i qsθ˚pxi`1,σi`1q 4: z „Np0,Iq 5: xi Ðx1 i ` b σ2 i`1 ´σ2 i z 6: for j “1 to M do 7: z „Np0,Iq 8: xi Ðxi `ϵisθ˚pxi,σiq` ?2ϵiz 9: return x0 Algorithm 3 PC sampling (VP SDE) 1: xN „Np0,Iq 2: for i“N ´1 to 0 do 3: x1 i Ðp2 ´?1 ´βi`1qxi`1 `βi`1sθ˚pxi`1,i`1q 4: z „Np0,Iq 5: xi Ðx1 i `?βi`1z 6: for j “1 to M do 7: z „Np0,Iq 8: xi Ðxi `ϵisθ˚pxi,iq` ?2ϵiz 9: return x0 Algorithm 4 Corrector algorithm (VE SDE).

As noted by Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. (2020), FIDs can be signiﬁcantly worse without removing this noise. This unfortunate sensitivity to noise is also part of the reason why NCSN models trained with SMLD has been performing worse than DDPM models in terms of FID, because the former does not use a denoising step at the end of sampling, while the latter does. In all experiments of this paper we ensure there is a single denoising step at the end of sampling, using Tweedie’s formula (Efron, 2011). Figure 9: PC sampling for LSUN bedroom and church. The vertical axis corresponds to the total computation, and the horizontal axis represents the amount of computation allocated to the corrector. Samples are the best when computation is split between the predictor and corrector. Training We use the same architecture in Ho et al. (2020) for our score-based models. For the VE SDE, we train a model with the original SMLD objective in Eq. (1); similarly for the VP SDE, we use the original DDPM objective in Eq. (3). We apply a total number of 1000 noise scales for training both models. For results in Fig. 9, we train an NCSN++ model (deﬁnition in Appendix H) on 23Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Table 4: Comparing different samplers on CIFAR-10, where “P2000” uses the rounding interpolation between noise scales.

(7). The batch size is ﬁxed to 128 on CIFAR-10 and 64 on LSUN. Ad-hoc interpolation methods for noise scales Models in this experiment are all trained with 1000 noise scales. To get results for P2000 (predictor-only sampler using 2000 steps) which requires 2000 noise scales, we need to interpolate between 1000 noise scales at test time. The speciﬁc architecture of the noise-conditional score-based model in Ho et al. (2020) uses sinusoidal positional embeddings for conditioning on integer time steps. This allows us to interpolate between noise scales at test time in an ad-hoc way (while it is hard to do so for other architectures like the one in Song & Ermon (2019)). Speciﬁcally, for SMLD models, we keep σmin and σmax ﬁxed and double the number of time steps. For DDPM models, we halve βmin and βmax before doubling the number of time steps. Suppose tsθpx,iquN´1 i“0 is a score-based model trained on N time steps, and let ts1 θpx,iqu2N´1 i“0 denote the corresponding interpolated score-based model at 2N time steps. We test two different interpolation strategies for time steps: linear interpolation where s1 θpx,iq“ sθpx,i{2qand rounding interpolation where s1 θpx,iq“ sθpx,ti{2uq. We provide results with linear interpolation in Table 1, and give results of rounding interpolation in Table 4. We observe that different interpolation methods result in performance differences but maintain the general trend of predictor-corrector methods performing on par or better than predictor-only or corrector-only samplers. Hyper-parameters of the samplers For Predictor-Corrector and corrector-only samplers on CIFAR-10, we search for the best signal-to-noise ratio ( r) over a grid that increments at 0.01. We report the best r in Table 5. For LSUN bedroom/church outdoor, we ﬁx r to 0.075. Unless otherwise noted, we use one corrector step per noise scale for all PC samplers. We use two corrector steps per noise scale for corrector-only samplers on CIFAR-10. For sample generation, the batch size is 1024 on CIFAR-10 and 8 on LSUN bedroom/church outdoor. H A RCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS We explored several architecture designs to improve score-based models for both VE and VP SDEs. Our endeavor gives rise to new state-of-the-art sample quality on CIFAR-10, new state-of-the-art likelihood on uniformly dequantized CIFAR-10, and enables the ﬁrst high-ﬁdelity image samples of resolution 1024 ˆ1024 from score-based generative models. Code and checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/yang-song/score sde. 24Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 H.1 S ETTINGS FOR ARCHITECTURE EXPLORATION Unless otherwise noted, all models are trained for 1.3M iterations, and we save one checkpoint per 50k iterations. For VE SDEs, we consider two datasets: 32 ˆ32 CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and 64 ˆ64 CelebA (Liu et al., 2015), pre-processed following Song & Ermon (2020). We compare different conﬁgurations based on their FID scores averaged over checkpoints after 0.5M iterations. For VP SDEs, we only consider the CIFAR-10 dataset to save computation, and compare models based on the average FID scores over checkpoints obtained between 0.25M and 0.5M iterations, because FIDs turn to increase after 0.5M iterations for VP SDEs. All FIDs are computed on 50k samples with tensorflow gan. For sampling, we use the PC sampler discretized at 1000 time steps. We choose reverse diffusion (see Appendix E) as the predictor. We use one corrector step per update of the predictor for VE SDEs with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.16, but save the corrector step for VP SDEs since correctors there only give slightly better results but require double computation. We follow Ho et al. (2020) for optimization, including the learning rate, gradient clipping, and learning rate warm-up schedules. Unless otherwise noted, models are trained with the original discrete SMLD and DDPM objectives in Eqs. (1) and (3) and use a batch size of 128. The optimal architectures found under these settings are subsequently transferred to continuous objectives and deeper models. We also directly transfer the best architecture for VP SDEs to sub-VP SDEs, given the similarity of these two SDEs.

Our architecture is mostly based on Ho et al. (2020). We additionally introduce the following components to maximize the potential improvement of score-based models. 1. Upsampling and downsampling images with anti-aliasing based on Finite Impulse Re- sponse (FIR) (Zhang, 2019). We follow the same implementation and hyper-parameters in StyleGAN-2 (Karras et al., 2020b). 2. Rescaling all skip connections by 1{ ? 2. This has been demonstrated effective in several best- in-class GAN models, including ProgressiveGAN (Karras et al., 2018), StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019) and StyleGAN-2 (Karras et al., 2020b). 3. Replacing the original residual blocks in DDPM with residual blocks from BigGAN (Brock et al., 2018). 4. Increasing the number of residual blocks per resolution from 2 to 4. 25Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 5. Incorporating progressive growing architectures. We consider two progressive architectures for input: “input skip” and “residual”, and two progressive architectures for output: “output skip” and “residual”. These progressive architectures are deﬁned and implemented according to StyleGAN-2. We also tested equalized learning rates, a trick used in very successful models like Progressive- GAN (Karras et al., 2018) and StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019). However, we found it harmful at an early stage of our experiments, and therefore decided not to explore more on it. The exponential moving average (EMA) rate has a signiﬁcant impact on performance. For models trained with VE perturbations, we notice that 0.999 works better than 0.9999, whereas for models trained with VP perturbations it is the opposite. We therefore use an EMA rate of 0.999 and 0.9999 for VE and VP models respectively. H.2 R ESULTS ON CIFAR-10 All architecture components introduced above can improve the performance of score-based models trained with VE SDEs, as shown in Fig. 10. The box plots demonstrate the importance of each component when other components can vary freely. On both CIFAR-10 and CelebA, the additional components that we explored always improve the performance on average for VE SDEs. For progressive growing, it is not clear which combination of conﬁgurations consistently performs the best, but the results are typically better than when no progressive growing architecture is used. Our best score-based model for VE SDEs 1) uses FIR upsampling/downsampling, 2) rescales skip connections, 3) employs BigGAN-type residual blocks, 4) uses 4 residual blocks per resolution instead of 2, and 5) uses “residual” for input and no progressive growing architecture for output. We name this model “NCSN++”, following the naming convention of previous SMLD models (Song & Ermon, 2019; 2020). We followed a similar procedure to examine these architecture components for VP SDEs, except that we skipped experiments on CelebA due to limited computing resources. The NCSN++ architecture worked decently well for VP SDEs, ranked 4th place over all 144 possible conﬁgurations. The top con- ﬁguration, however, has a slightly different structure, which uses no FIR upsampling/downsampling and no progressive growing architecture compared to NCSN++. We name this model “DDPM++”, following the naming convention of Ho et al. (2020). The basic NCSN++ model with 4 residual blocks per resolution achieves an FID of 2.45 on CIFAR-10, whereas the basic DDPM++ model achieves an FID of 2.78. Here in order to match the convention used in Karras et al. (2018); Song & Ermon (2019) and Ho et al. (2020), we report the lowest FID value over the course of training, rather than the average FID value over checkpoints after 0.5M iterations (used for comparing different models of VE SDEs) or between 0.25M and 0.5M iterations (used for comparing VP SDE models) in our architecture exploration. Switching from discrete training objectives to continuous ones in Eq. (7) further improves the FID values for all SDEs. To condition the NCSN++ model on continuous time variables, we change positional embeddings, the layers in Ho et al. (2020) for conditioning on discrete time steps, to random Fourier feature embeddings (Tancik et al., 2020). The scale parameter of these random Fourier feature embeddings is ﬁxed to 16. We also reduce the number of training iterations to 0.95M to suppress overﬁtting. These changes improve the FID on CIFAR-10 from 2.45 to 2.38 for NCSN++ trained with the VE SDE, resulting in a model called “NCSN++ cont.”. In addition, we can further improve the FID from 2.38 to 2.20 by doubling the number of residual blocks per resolution for NCSN++ cont., resulting in the model denoted as “NCSN++ cont. (deep)”. All quantitative results are summarized in Table 3, and we provide random samples from our best model in Fig. 11. Similarly, we can also condition the DDPM++ model on continuous time steps, resulting in a model “DDPM++ cont.”. When trained with the VP SDE, it improves the FID of 2.78 from DDPM++ to 2.55. When trained with the sub-VP SDE, it achieves an FID of 2.61. To get better performance, we used the Euler-Maruyama solver as the predictor for continuously-trained models, instead of the ancestral sampling predictor or the reverse diffusion predictor. This is because the discretization strategy of the original DDPM method does not match the variance of the continuous process well when tÑ0, which signiﬁcantly hurts FID scores. As shown in Table 2, the likelihood values are 3.21 and 3.05 bits/dim for VP and sub-VP SDEs respectively. Doubling the depth, and trainin with 26Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 Figure 11: Unconditional CIFAR-10 samples from NCSN++ cont.

(deep)”. Its FID score is 2.41, same for both VP and sub-VP SDEs. When trained with the sub-VP SDE, it can achieve a likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim. Here all likelihood values are reported for the last checkpoint during training. H.3 H IGH RESOLUTION IMAGES Encouraged by the success of NCSN++ on CIFAR-10, we proceed to test it on 1024 ˆ1024 CelebA- HQ (Karras et al., 2018), a task that was previously only achievable by some GAN models and VQ-V AE-2 (Razavi et al., 2019). We used a batch size of 8, increased the EMA rate to 0.9999, and trained a model similar to NCSN++ with the continuous objective (Eq. (7)) for around 2.4M iterations (please ﬁnd the detailed architecture in our code release.) We use the PC sampler discretized at 2000 steps with the reverse diffusion predictor, one Langevin step per predictor update and a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.15. The scale parameter for the random Fourier feature embeddings is ﬁxed to 16. We use the “input skip” progressive architecture for the input, and “output skip” progressive architecture for the output. We provide samples in Fig. 12. Although these samples are not perfect (e.g., there are visible ﬂaws on facial symmetry), we believe these results are encouraging and can demonstrate the scalability of our approach. Future work on more effective architectures are likely to signiﬁcantly advance the performance of score-based generative models on this task. I C ONTROLLABLE GENERATION Consider a forward SDE with the following general form dx “fpx,tqdt`Gpx,tqdw, and suppose the initial state distribution is p0pxp0q| yq. The density at time tis ptpxptq| yqwhen conditioned on y. Therefore, using Anderson (1982), the reverse-time SDE is given by dx “tfpx,tq´ ∇ ¨rGpx,tqGpx,tqTs´ Gpx,tqGpx,tqT∇x log ptpx |yqudt`Gpx,tqd ¯w. (48) Since ptpxptq| yq9ptpxptqqppy |xptqq, the score ∇x log ptpxptq| yqcan be computed easily by ∇x log ptpxptq| yq“ ∇x log ptpxptqq` ∇x log ppy |xptqq. (49) This subsumes the conditional reverse-time SDE in Eq. (14) as a special case. All sampling methods we have discussed so far can be applied to the conditional reverse-time SDE for sample generation. I.1 C LASS -CONDITIONAL SAMPLING When y represents class labels, we can train a time-dependent classiﬁer ptpy | xptqqfor class- conditional sampling. Since the forward SDE is tractable, we can easily create a pair of training data pxptq,yqby ﬁrst sampling pxp0q,yqfrom a dataset and then obtaining xptq„ p0tpxptq| xp0qq. Afterwards, we may employ a mixture of cross-entropy losses over different time steps, like Eq. (7), to train the time-dependent classiﬁer ptpy |xptqq. To test this idea, we trained a Wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) (Wide-ResNet-28-10) on CIFAR-10 with VE perturbations. The classiﬁer is condi- tioned on log σi using random Fourier features (Tancik et al., 2020), and the training objective is a simple sum of cross-entropy losses sampled at different scales. We provide a plot to show the accuracy of this classiﬁer over noise scales in Fig. 13. The score-based model is an unconditional NCSN++ (4 blocks/resolution) in Table 3, and we generate samples using the PC algorithm with 2000 discretization steps. The class-conditional samples are provided in Fig. 4, and an extended set of conditional samples is given in Fig. 13. I.2 I MPUTATION Imputation is a special case of conditional sampling.

We provided an extended set of inpainting results in Figs. 14 and 15. I.3 C OLORIZATION Colorization is a special case of imputation, except that the known data dimensions are coupled. We can decouple these data dimensions by using an orthogonal linear transformation to map the gray-scale image to a separate channel in a different space, and then perform imputation to complete the other channels before transforming everything back to the original image space. The orthogonal matrix we used to decouple color channels is ˜0.577 ´0.816 0 0.577 0 .408 0 .707 0.577 0 .408 ´0.707 ¸ . Because the transformations are all orthogonal matrices, the standard Wiener process wptqwill still be a standard Wiener process in the transformed space, allowing us to build an SDE and use the same imputation method in Appendix I.2. We provide an extended set of colorization results in Figs. 16 and 17. I.4 S OLVING GENERAL INVERSE PROBLEMS Suppose we have two random variables x and y, and we know the forward process of generating y from x, given by ppy |xq. The inverse problem is to obtain x from y, that is, generating samples from ppx |yq. In principle, we can estimate the prior distribution ppxqand obtain ppx |yqusing Bayes’ rule: ppx |yq“ ppxqppy |xq{ppyq. In practice, however, both estimating the prior and performing Bayesian inference are non-trivial. Leveraging Eq. (48), score-based generative models provide one way to solve the inverse problem. Suppose we have a diffusion process txptquT t“0 generated by perturbing x with an SDE, and a 31Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021 time-dependent score-based model sθ˚pxptq,tqtrained to approximate ∇x log ptpxptqq. Once we have an estimate of ∇x log ptpxptq| yq, we can simulate the reverse-time SDE in Eq. (48) to sample from p0pxp0q| yq“ ppx |yq. To obtain this estimate, we ﬁrst observe that ∇x log ptpxptq| yq“ ∇x log ż ptpxptq| yptq,yqppyptq| yqdyptq, where yptqis deﬁned via xptqand the forward process ppyptq| xptqq. Now assume two conditions: • ppyptq| yqis tractable. We can often derive this distribution from the interaction between the forward process and the SDE, like in the case of image imputation and colorization. • ptpxptq |yptq,yq «ptpxptq |yptqq. For small t, yptqis almost the same as y so the approximation holds. For large t, y becomes further away from xptqin the Markov chain, and thus have smaller impact on xptq. Moreover, the approximation error for large tmatter less for the ﬁnal sample, since it is used early in the sampling process. Given these two assumptions, we have ∇x log ptpxptq| yq« ∇x log ż ptpxptq| yptqqppyptq| yqdy «∇x log ptpxptq| ˆyptqq “∇x log ptpxptqq` ∇x log ptpˆyptq| xptqq «sθ˚pxptq,tq` ∇x log ptpˆyptq| xptqq, (50) where ˆyptqis a sample from ppyptq |yq.

They are also rapidly ﬁnding use in other domains such as audio [28, 38] and video [19] generation, image segmentation [4, 57] and language translation [35]. As such, there is great interest in applying these models and improving them further in terms of image/distribution quality, training cost, and generation speed. The literature on these models is dense on theory, and derivations of sampling schedule, training dynamics, noise level parameterization, etc., tend to be based as directly as possible on theoretical frameworks, which ensures that the models are on a solid theoretical footing. However, this approach has a danger of obscuring the available design space — a proposed model may appear as a tightly coupled package where no individual component can be modiﬁed without breaking the entire system. As our ﬁrst contribution, we take a look at the theory behind these models from a practical standpoint, focusing more on the “tangible” objects and algorithms that appear in the training and sampling phases, and less on the statistical processes from which they might be derived. The goal is to obtain better insights into how these components are linked together and what degrees of freedom are available in the design of the overall system. We focus on the broad class of models where a neural network is used to model the score [22] of a noise level dependent marginal distribution of the training data corrupted by Gaussian noise. Thus, our work is in the context of denoising score matching[54]. Our second set of contributions concerns the sampling processes used to synthesize images using diffusion models. We identify the best-performing time discretization for sampling, apply a higher- order Runge–Kutta method for the sampling process, evaluate different sampler schedules, and analyze the usefulness of stochasticity in the sampling process. The result of these improvements is a signiﬁcant drop in the number of sampling steps required during synthesis, and the improved sampler can be used as a drop-in replacement with several widely used diffusions models [37, 49]. 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022). arXiv:2206.00364v2  [cs.CV]  11 Oct 2022σ=0 0.2 0.5 1 2 3 5 7 10 20 50 σ=0 0.2 0.5 1 2 3 5 7 10 20 50 (a) Noisy images drawn from p(x; σ) (b) Ideal denoiser outputs D(x; σ) Figure 1: Denoising score matching on CIFAR-10.

(b) Optimal denoising result from minimizing Eq. 2 analytically (see Appendix B.3). With increasing noise level, the result approaches dataset mean. The third set of contributions focuses on the training of the score-modeling neural network. While we continue to rely on the commonly used network architectures (DDPM [ 16], NCSN [48]), we provide the ﬁrst principled analysis of the preconditioning of the networks’ inputs, outputs, and loss functions in a diffusion model setting and derive best practices for improving the training dynamics. We also suggest an improved distribution of noise levels during training, and note that non-leaking augmentation [25] — typically used with GANs — is beneﬁcial for diffusion models as well. Taken together, our contributions enable signiﬁcant improvements in result quality, e.g., leading to record FIDs of 1.79 for CIFAR-10 [29] and 1.36 for ImageNet [8] in 64×64 resolution. With all key ingredients of the design space explicitly tabulated, we believe that our approach will allow easier innovation on the individual components, and thus enable more extensive and targeted exploration of the design space of diffusion models. Our implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/edm 2 Expressing diffusion models in a common framework Let us denote the data distribution by pdata(x), with standard deviation σdata, and consider the family of molliﬁed distributions p(x; σ) obtained by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise of standard deviation σto the data. For σmax ≫σdata, p(x; σmax) is practically indistinguishable from pure Gaussian noise. The idea of diffusion models is to randomly sample a noise image x0 ∼N(0,σ2 maxI), and sequentially denoise it into images xi with noise levels σ0 = σmax >σ1 >··· >σN = 0 so that at each noise level xi ∼p(xi; σi). The endpoint xN of this process is thus distributed according to the data. Song et al. [49] present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that maintains the desired distribution pas sample xevolves over time. This allows the above process to be implemented using a stochastic solver that both removes and adds noise at each iteration. They also give a corresponding “probability ﬂow” ordinary differential equation (ODE) where the only source of randomness is the initial noise image x0. Contrary to the usual order of treatment, we begin by examining the ODE, as it offers a fruitful setting for analyzing sampling trajectories and their discretizations. The insights carry over to stochastic sampling, which we reintroduce as a generalization in Section 4. ODE formulation. A probability ﬂow ODE [49] continuously increases or reduces noise level of the image when moving forward or backward in time, respectively. To specify the ODE, we must ﬁrst choose a schedule σ(t) that deﬁnes the desired noise level at time t. For example, setting σ(t) ∝ √ t is mathematically natural, as it corresponds to constant-speed heat diffusion [12]. However, we will show in Section 3 that the choice of schedule has major practical implications and should not be made on the basis of theoretical convenience. The deﬁning characteristic of the probability ﬂow ODE is that evolving a sample xa ∼p ( xa; σ(ta) ) from time ta to tb (either forward or backward in time) yields a samplexb ∼p ( xb; σ(tb) ) . Following previous work [49], this requirement is satisﬁed (see Appendix B.1 and B.2) by dx= −˙σ(t) σ(t) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt, (1) where the dot denotes a time derivative. ∇xlog p(x; σ) is the score function[22], a vector ﬁeld that points towards higher density of data at a given noise level. Intuitively, an inﬁnitesimal forward step of this ODE nudges the sample away from the data, at a rate that depends on the change in noise level. Equivalently, a backward step nudges the sample towards the data distribution. Denoising score matching. The score function has the remarkable property that it does not depend on the generally intractable normalization constant of the underlying density function p(x; σ) [22], 2Table 1: Speciﬁc design choices employed by different model families. N is the number of ODE solver iterations that we wish to execute during sampling. The corresponding sequence of time steps is {t0,t1,...,t N}, where tN = 0. If the model was originally trained for speciﬁc choices of N and {ti}, the originals are denoted by M and {uj}, respectively. The denoiser is deﬁned as Dθ(x; σ) = cskip(σ)x+ cout(σ)Fθ ( cin(σ)x; cnoise(σ) ) ; Fθ represents the raw neural network layers.

In this light, the score function isolates the noise component from the signal in x, and Eq. 1 ampliﬁes (or diminishes) it over time. Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of ideal Din practice. The key observation in diffusion models is that D(x; σ) can be implemented as a neural network Dθ(x; σ) trained according to Eq. 2. Note that Dθ may include additional pre- and post-processing steps, such as scaling xto an appropriate dynamic range; we will return to such preconditioning in Section 5. Time-dependent signal scaling. Some methods (see Appendix C.1) introduce an additional scale schedule s(t) and consider x= s(t)ˆxto be a scaled version of the original, non-scaled variable ˆx. This changes the time-dependent probability density, and consequently also the ODE solution trajectories. The resulting ODE is a generalization of Eq. 1: dx= [˙s(t) s(t) x−s(t)2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) ∇xlog p ( x s(t); σ(t) )] dt. (4) Note that we explicitly undo the scaling ofxwhen evaluating the score function to keep the deﬁnition of p(x; σ) independent of s(t). Solution by discretization. The ODE to be solved is obtained by substituting Eq. 3 into Eq. 4 to deﬁne the point-wise gradient, and the solution can be found by numerical integration, i.e., taking ﬁnite steps over discrete time intervals. This requires choosing both the integration scheme (e.g., Euler or a variant of Runge–Kutta), as well as the discrete sampling times {t0,t1,...,t N}. Many prior works rely on Euler’s method, but we show in Section 3 that a 2nd order solver offers a better computational tradeoff. For brevity, we do not provide a separate pseudocode for Euler’s method applied to our ODE here, but it can be extracted from Algorithm 1 by omitting lines 6–8. Putting it together. Table 1 presents formulas for reproducing deterministic variants of three earlier methods in our framework.

Some of our formulas appear quite different from the original papers as indirection and recursion have been removed; see Appendix C for details. The main purpose of this reframing is to bring into light all the independent components that often appear tangled together in previous work. In our framework, there are no implicit dependencies between the components — any choices (within reason) for the individual formulas will, in principle, lead to a functioning model. In other words, changing one component does not necessitate changes elsewhere in order to, e.g., maintain the property that the model converges to the data in the limit. In practice, some choices and combinations will of course work better than others. 3 Improvements to deterministic sampling Improving the output quality and/or decreasing the computational cost of sampling are common topics in diffusion model research (e.g., [10, 24, 31, 32, 33, 37, 44, 53, 55, 56, 59]). Our hypothesis is that the choices related to the sampling process are largely independent of the other components, such as network architecture and training details. In other words, the training procedure of Dθ should not dictate σ(t), s(t), and {ti}, nor vice versa; from the viewpoint of the sampler, Dθ is simply a black box [55, 56]. We test this by evaluating different samplers on three pre-trained models, each representing a different theoretical framework and model family. We ﬁrst measure baseline results for these models using their original sampler implementations, and then bring these samplers into our uniﬁed framework using the formulas in Table 1, followed by our improvements. This allows us to evaluate different practical choices and propose general improvements to the sampling process that are applicable to all models. We evaluate the “DDPM++ cont. (VP)” and “NCSN ++ cont. (VE)” models by Song et al. [ 49] trained on unconditional CIFAR-10 [29] at 32×32, corresponding to the variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE) formulations [49], originally inspired by DDPM [16] and SMLD [48]. We also evaluate the “ADM (dropout)” model by Dhariwal and Nichol [9] trained on class-conditional Im- ageNet [8] at 64×64, corresponding to the improved DDPM (iDDPM) formulation [37]. This model was trained using a discrete set of M = 1000 noise levels. Further details are given in Appendix C. We evaluate the result quality in terms of Fréchet inception distance (FID) [15] computed between 50,000 generated images and all available real images. Figure 2 shows FID as a function of neural function evaluations (NFE), i.e., how many times Dθ is evaluated to produce a single image. Given that the sampling process is dominated entirely by the cost of Dθ, improvements in NFE translate directly to sampling speed. The original deterministic samplers are shown in blue, and the reimple- mentations of these methods in our uniﬁed framework (orange) yield similar but consistently better results. The differences are explained by certain oversights in the original implementations as well as our more careful treatment of discrete noise levels in the case of DDIM; see Appendix C. Note that our reimplementations are fully speciﬁed by Algorithm 1 and Table 1, even though the original codebases are structured very differently from each other. Discretization and higher-order integrators. Solving an ODE numerically is necessarily an approximation of following the true solution trajectory. At each step, the solver introduces truncation error that accumulates over the course of N steps. The local error generally scales superlinearly with respect to step size, and thus increasing N improves the accuracy of the solution. The commonly used Euler’s method is a ﬁrst order ODE solver withO(h2) local error with respect to step size h. Higher-order Runge–Kutta methods [50] scale more favorably but require multiple 4Algorithm 1 Deterministic sampling using Heun’s 2nd order method with arbitrary σ(t) and s(t). 1: procedure HEUN SAMPLER (Dθ(x; σ), σ(t), s(t), ti∈{0,...,N}) 2: sample x0 ∼N ( 0, σ2(t0) s2(t0) I ) ⊿Generate initial sample at t0 3: for i∈{0,...,N −1}do ⊿Solve Eq. 4 over N time steps 4: di ← (˙σ(ti) σ(ti) + ˙s(ti) s(ti) ) xi − ˙σ(ti)s(ti) σ(ti) Dθ ( xi s(ti); σ(ti) ) ⊿Evaluate dx/dtat ti 5: xi+1 ←xi + (ti+1 −ti)di ⊿Take Euler step from ti to ti+1 6: if σ(ti+1) ̸= 0 then ⊿Apply 2nd order correction unless σgoes to zero 7: d′ i ← (˙σ(ti+1) σ(ti+1) + ˙s(ti+1) s(ti+1) ) xi+1 −˙σ(ti+1)s(ti+1) σ(ti+1) Dθ ( xi+1 s(ti+1);σ(ti+1) ) ⊿Eval. dx/dtat ti+1 8: xi+1 ←xi + (ti+1 −ti) (1 2 di + 1 2 d′ i ) ⊿Explicit trapezoidal rule at ti+1 9: return xN ⊿Return noise-free sample at tN evaluations of Dθ per step. Linear multistep methods have also been recently proposed for sampling diffusion models [31, 59]. Through extensive tests, we have found Heun’s 2 nd order method [2] (a.k.a. improved Euler, trapezoidal rule) — previously explored in the context of diffusion models by Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. [24] — to provide an excellent tradeoff between truncation error and NFE. As illustrated in Algorithm 1, it introduces an additional correction step forxi+1 to account for change in dx/dtbetween ti and ti+1. This correction leads to O(h3) local error at the cost of one additional evaluation of Dθ per step. Note that stepping to σ= 0 would result in a division by zero, so we revert to Euler’s method in this case. We discuss the general family of 2nd order solvers in Appendix D.2. The time steps {ti}determine how the step sizes and thus truncation errors are distributed between different noise levels. We provide a detailed analysis in Appendix D.1, concluding that the step size should decrease monotonically with decreasing σand it does not need to vary on a per-sample basis. We adopt a parameterized scheme where the time steps are deﬁned according to a sequence of noise levels {σi}, i.e., ti = σ−1(σi). We set σi<N = (Ai+ B)ρ and select the constants Aand Bso that σ0 = σmax and σN−1 = σmin, which gives σi<N = ( σmax 1 ρ + i N−1 (σmin 1 ρ −σmax 1 ρ) )ρ and σN = 0. (5) Here ρcontrols how much the steps near σmin are shortened at the expense of longer steps near σmax. Our analysis in Appendix D.1 shows that setting ρ= 3 nearly equalizes the truncation error at each step, but that ρin range of 5 to 10 performs much better for sampling images. This suggests that errors near σmin have a large impact. We set ρ= 7 for the remainder of this paper. Results for Heun’s method and Eq. 5 are shown as the green curves in Figure 2. We observe consistent improvement in all cases: Heun’s method reaches the same FID as Euler’s method with considerably lower NFE. Trajectory curvature and noise schedule. The shape of the ODE solution trajectories is deﬁned by functions σ(t) and s(t). The choice of these functions offers a way to reduce the truncation errors discussed above, as their magnitude can be expected to scale proportional to the curvature of dx/dt. We argue that the best choice for these functions is σ(t) = tand s(t) = 1, which is also the choice made in DDIM [47]. With this choice, the ODE of Eq. 4 simpliﬁes to dx/dt= ( x−D(x; t) ) /tand σand tbecome interchangeable. An immediate consequence is that at any xand t, a single Euler step to t= 0 yields the denoised image Dθ(x; t). The tangent of the solution trajectory therefore always points towards the denoiser output. This can be expected to change only slowly with the noise level, which corresponds to largely linear solution trajectories. The 1D ODE sketch of Figure 3c supports this intuition; the solution trajectories approach linear at both large and small noise levels, and have substantial curvature in only a small region in between. The same effect can be seen with real data in Figure 1b, where the change between different denoiser targets occurs in a relatively narrow σrange. With the advocated schedule, this corresponds to high ODE curvature being limited to this same range. The effect of setting σ(t) = tand s(t) = 1 is shown as the red curves in Figure 2. As DDIM already employs these same choices, the red curve is identical to the green one for ImageNet-64. However, VP and VE beneﬁt considerably from switching away from their original schedules. 5/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001b /uni00000015 /uni00000014 /uni00000013 /uni00000014 /uni00000015 x /uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000017/uni00000013  x /uni00000013/uni00000018/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000018/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000015/uni00000018 /uni00000017/uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000013 /uni00000015/uni00000013 /uni00000017/uni00000013  x t= t= t= (a) Variance preserving ODE [49] (b) Variance exploding ODE [49] (c) DDIM [47] / Our ODE Figure 3: A sketch of ODE curvature in 1D where pdata is two Dirac peaks at x= ±1.

As σ→0, the trajectories become linear and point towards the data manifold. Discussion. The choices that we made in this section to improve deterministic sampling are summarized in the Sampling part of Table 1. Together, they reduce the NFE needed to reach high- quality results by a large factor: 7.3×for VP, 300×for VE, and 3.2×for DDIM, corresponding to the highlighted NFE values in Figure 2. In practice, we can generate 26.3 high-quality CIFAR-10 images per second on a single NVIDIA V100. The consistency of improvements corroborates our hypothesis that the sampling process is orthogonal to how each model was originally trained. As further validation, we show results for the adaptive RK45 method [ 11] using our schedule as the dashed black curves in Figure 2; the cost of this sophisticated ODE solver outweighs its beneﬁts. 4 Stochastic sampling Deterministic sampling offers many beneﬁts, e.g., the ability to turn real images into their corre- sponding latent representations by inverting the ODE. However, it tends to lead to worse output quality [47, 49] than stochastic sampling that injects fresh noise into the image in each step. Given that ODEs and SDEs recover the same distributions in theory, what exactly is the role of stochasticity? Background. The SDEs of Song et al. [49] can be generalized [20, 58] as a sum of the probability ﬂow ODE of Eq. 1 and a time-varying Langevin diffusionSDE [14] (see Appendix B.5): dx±= −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt   probability ﬂow ODE (Eq. 1) ±β(t)σ(t)2∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt   deterministic noise decay + √ 2β(t)σ(t) dωt   noise injection    Langevin diffusion SDE , (6) where ωt is the standard Wiener process. dx+ and dx−are now separate SDEs for moving forward and backward in time, related by the time reversal formula of Anderson [1]. The Langevin term can further be seen as a combination of a deterministic score-based denoising term and a stochastic noise injection term, whose net noise level contributions cancel out. As such, β(t) effectively expresses the relative rate at which existing noise is replaced with new noise. The SDEs of Song et al. [ 49] are recovered with the choice β(t) = ˙σ(t)/σ(t), whereby the score vanishes from the forward SDE. This perspective reveals why stochasticity is helpful in practice: The implicit Langevin diffusion drives the sample towards the desired marginal distribution at a given time, actively correcting for any errors made in earlier sampling steps. On the other hand, approximating the Langevin term with discrete SDE solver steps introduces error in itself. Previous results [3, 24, 47, 49] suggest that non-zero β(t) is helpful, but as far as we can tell, the implicit choice forβ(t) in Song et al. [49] enjoys no special properties. Hence, the optimal amount of stochasticity should be determined empirically. Our stochastic sampler. We propose a stochastic sampler that combines our 2nd order deterministic ODE integrator with explicit Langevin-like “churn” of adding and removing noise. A pseudocode is given in Algorithm 2. At each step i, given the sample xi at noise level ti (= σ(ti)), we perform two 6Algorithm 2 Our stochastic sampler with σ(t) = tand s(t) = 1. 1: procedure STOCHASTIC SAMPLER (Dθ(x; σ), ti∈{0,...,N}, γi∈{0,...,N−1}, Snoise) 2: sample x0 ∼N ( 0, t2 0 I ) 3: for i∈{0,...,N −1}do ⊿γi = { min ( Schurn N ,√2−1 ) if ti∈[Stmin,Stmax] 0 otherwise4: sample ϵi ∼N ( 0, S2 noise I ) 5: ˆti ←ti + γiti ⊿Select temporarily increased noise level ˆti 6: ˆxi ←xi + √ˆt2 i −t2 i ϵi ⊿Add new noise to move from ti to ˆti 7: di ← ( ˆxi −Dθ(ˆxi; ˆti) ) /ˆti ⊿Evaluate dx/dtat ˆti 8: xi+1 ←ˆxi + (ti+1 −ˆti)di ⊿Take Euler step from ˆti to ti+1 9: if ti+1 ̸= 0 then 10: d′ i ← ( xi+1 −Dθ(xi+1; ti+1) ) /ti+1 ⊿Apply 2nd order correction 11: xi+1 ←ˆxi + (ti+1 −ˆti) (1 2 di + 1 2 d′ i ) 12: return xN sub-steps. First, we add noise to the sample according to a factor γi ≥0 to reach a higher noise level ˆti = ti + γiti. Second, from the increased-noise sample ˆxi, we solve the ODE backward from ˆti to ti+1 with a single step. This yields a sample xi+1 with noise level ti+1, and the iteration continues. We stress that this is not a general-purpose SDE solver, but a sampling procedure tailored for the speciﬁc problem. Its correctness stems from the alternation of two sub-steps that each maintain the correct distribution (up to truncation error in the ODE step). The predictor-corrector sampler of Song et al. [49] has a conceptually similar structure to ours. To analyze the main difference between our method and Euler–Maruyama, we ﬁrst note a subtle discrepancy in the latter when discretizing Eq. 6. One can interpret Euler–Maruyama as ﬁrst adding noise and then performing an ODE step, not from the intermediate state after noise injection, but assuming that xand σ remained at the initial state at the beginning of the iteration step. In our method, the parameters used to evaluate Dθ on line 7 of Algorithm 2 correspond to the state after noise injection, whereas an Euler–Maruyama -like method would use xi; ti instead of ˆxi; ˆti. In the limit of ∆t approaching zero there may be no difference between these choices, but the distinction appears to become signiﬁcant when pursuing low NFE with large steps. Practical considerations. Increasing the amount of stochasticity is effective in correcting errors made by earlier sampling steps, but it has its own drawbacks. We have observed (see Appendix E.1) that excessive Langevin-like addition and removal of noise results in gradual loss of detail in the generated images with all datasets and denoiser networks. There is also a drift toward oversaturated colors at very low and high noise levels. We suspect that practical denoisers induce a slightly non- conservative vector ﬁeld in Eq. 3, violating the premises of Langevin diffusion and causing these detrimental effects. Notably, our experiments with analytical denoisers (such as the one in Figure 1b) have not shown such degradation. If the degradation is caused by ﬂaws in Dθ(x; σ), they can only be remedied using heuristic means during sampling. We address the drift toward oversaturated colors by only enabling stochasticity within a speciﬁc range of noise levels ti ∈[Stmin,Stmax]. For these noise levels, we deﬁne γi = Schurn/N, where Schurn controls the overall amount of stochasticity. We further clamp γi to never introduce more new noise than what is already present in the image. Finally, we have found that the loss of detail can be partially counteracted by setting Snoise slightly above 1 to inﬂate the standard deviation for the newly added noise. This suggests that a major component of the hypothesized non-conservativity of Dθ(x; σ) is a tendency to remove slightly too much noise — most likely due to regression toward the mean that can be expected to happen with any L2-trained denoiser [30]. Evaluation. Figure 4 shows that our stochastic sampler outperforms previous samplers [24, 37, 49] by a signiﬁcant margin, especially at low step counts. Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. [24] use a standard higher-order adaptive SDE solver [41] and its performance is a good baseline for such solvers in general. Our sampler has been tailored to the use case by, e.g., performing noise injection and ODE step sequentially, and it is not adaptive. It is an open question if adaptive solvers can be a net win over a well-tuned ﬁxed schedule in sampling diffusion models. Through sampler improvements alone, we are able to bring the ImageNet-64 model that originally achieved FID 2.07 [9] to 1.55 that is very close to the state-of-the-art; previously, FID 1.48 has been 7NFE=1632 64 12825651210242048 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2FID 2.27 Deterministic Stmin,tmax= [0,∞]Stmin,tmax+Snoise= 1 Optimal settingsSnoise= 1 Original samplerJolicoeur-Martineau et al.

The purple curve corresponds to optimal choices for {Schurn,Stmin,Stmax,Snoise}; orange, blue, and green correspond to disabling the effects of Stmin,tmax and/or Snoise. The red curves show reference results for our deterministic sampler (Algorithm 1), equivalent to setting Schurn = 0. The dashed black curves correspond to the original stochastic samplers from previous work: Euler–Maruyama [49] for VP, predictor-corrector [49] for VE, and iDDPM [37] for ImageNet-64. The dots indicate lowest observed FID. reported for cascaded diffusion [17], 1.55 for classiﬁer-free guidance [18], and 1.52 for StyleGAN- XL [45]. While our results showcase the potential gains achievable through sampler improvements, they also highlight the main shortcoming of stochasticity: For best results, one must make several heuristic choices — either implicit or explicit — that depend on the speciﬁc model. Indeed, we had to ﬁnd the optimal values of {Schurn,Stmin,Stmax,Snoise}on a case-by-case basis using grid search (Appendix E.2). This raises a general concern that using stochastic sampling as the primary means of evaluating model improvements may inadvertently end up inﬂuencing the design choices related to model architecture and training. 5 Preconditioning and training There are various known good practices for training neural networks in a supervised fashion. For example, it is advisable to keep input and output signal magnitudes ﬁxed to, e.g., unit variance, and to avoid large variation in gradient magnitudes on a per-sample basis [5, 21]. Training a neural network to model Ddirectly would be far from ideal — for example, as the input x= y+ nis a combination of clean signal yand noise n∼N(0,σ2I), its magnitude varies immensely depending on noise level σ. For this reason, the common practice is to not represent Dθ as a neural network directly, but instead train a different network Fθ from which Dθ is derived. Previous methods [37, 47, 49] address the input scaling via a σ-dependent normalization factor and attempt to precondition the output by training Fθ to predict nscaled to unit variance, from which the signal is then reconstructed via Dθ(x; σ) = x−σFθ(·). This has the drawback that at large σ, the network needs to ﬁne-tune its output carefully to cancel out the existing noise nexactly and give the output at the correct scale; note that any errors made by the network are ampliﬁed by a factor of σ. In this situation, it would seem much easier to predict the expected output D(x; σ) directly. In the same spirit as previous parameterizations that adaptively mix signal and noise (e.g., [ 10, 44, 53]), we propose to precondition the neural network with a σ-dependent skip connection that allows it to estimate either yor n, or something in between. We thus write Dθ in the following form: Dθ(x; σ) = cskip(σ) x+ cout(σ) Fθ ( cin(σ) x; cnoise(σ) ) , (7) where Fθ is the neural network to be trained, cskip(σ) modulates the skip connection, cin(σ) and cout(σ) scale the input and output magnitudes, and cnoise(σ) maps noise level σinto a conditioning in- put for Fθ. Taking a weighted expectation of Eq. 2 over the noise levels givesthe overall training loss Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ) ∥D(y+ n; σ) −y∥2 2 ] , where σ∼ptrain, y∼pdata, and n∼N(0,σ2I). The probabil- ity of sampling a given noise level σis given by ptrain(σ) and the corresponding weight is given by λ(σ). We can equivalently express this loss with respect to the raw network output Fθ in Eq. 7: Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ) cout(σ)2    effective weight Fθ ( cin(σ) ·(y+ n); cnoise(σ) )    network output − 1 cout(σ) ( y−cskip(σ) ·(y+ n) )    effective training target 2 2 ] . (8) This form reveals the effective training target of Fθ, allowing us to determine suitable choices for the preconditioning functions from ﬁrst principles. As detailed in Appendix B.6, we derive our choices 8Table 2: Evaluation of our training improvements. The starting point (conﬁg A) is VP & VE using our deterministic sampler. At the end (conﬁgs E,F), VP & VE only differ in the architecture of Fθ.

The formula for cnoise is chosen empirically. Table 2 shows FID for a series of training setups, evaluated using our deterministic sampler from Section 3. We start with the baseline training setup of Song et al. [49], which differs considerably between the VP and VE cases; we provide separate results for each (conﬁg A). To obtain a more meaningful point of comparison, we re-adjust the basic hyperparameters (conﬁg B) and improve the expressive power of the model (conﬁg C) by removing the lowest-resolution layers and doubling the capacity of the highest-resolution layers instead; see Appendix F.3 for further details. We then replace the original choices of {cin,cout,cnoise,cskip}with our preconditioning (conﬁg D), which keeps the results largely unchanged — except for VE that improves considerably at 64 ×64 resolution. Instead of improving FID per se, the main beneﬁt of our preconditioning is that it makes the training more robust, enabling us to turn our focus on redesigning the loss function without adverse effects. Loss weighting and sampling. Eq. 8 shows that training Fθ as preconditioned in Eq. 7 incurs an effective per-sample loss weight of λ(σ)cout(σ)2. To balance the effective loss weights, we set λ(σ) = 1/cout(σ)2, which also equalizes the initial training loss over the entire σrange as shown in Figure 5a (green curve). Finally, we need to select ptrain(σ), i.e., how to choose noise levels during training. Inspecting the per-σloss after training (blue and orange curves) reveals that a signiﬁcant reduction is possible only at intermediate noise levels; at very low levels, it is both difﬁcult and irrelevant to discern the vanishingly small noise component, whereas at high levels the training targets are always dissimilar from the correct answer that approaches dataset average. Therefore, we target the training efforts to the relevant range using a simple log-normal distribution forptrain(σ) as detailed in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 5a (red curve). Table 2 shows that our proposed ptrain and λ (conﬁg E) lead to a dramatic improvement in FID in all cases when used in conjunction with our preconditioning (conﬁg D). In concurrent work, Choi et al. [6] propose a similar scheme to prioritize noise levels that are most relevant w.r.t. forming the perceptually recognizable content of the image. However, they only consider the choice of λin isolation, which results in a smaller overall improvement. Augmentation regularization. To prevent potential overﬁtting that often plagues diffusion models with smaller datasets, we borrow an augmentation pipeline from the GAN literature [25]. The pipeline consists of various geometric transformations (see Appendix F.2) that we apply to a training image prior to adding noise. To prevent the augmentations from leaking to the generated images, we provide the augmentation parameters as a conditioning input to Fθ; during inference we set the them to zero to guarantee that only non-augmented images are generated. Table 2 shows that data augmentation provides a consistent improvement (conﬁg F) that yields new state-of-the-art FIDs of 1.79 and 1.97 for conditional and unconditional CIFAR-10, beating the previous records of 1.85 [45] and 2.10 [53]. Stochastic sampling revisited. Interestingly, the relevance of stochastic sampling appears to di- minish as the model itself improves, as shown in Figure 5b,c. When using our training setup in CIFAR-10 (Figure 5b), the best results were obtained with deterministic sampling, and any amount of stochastic sampling was detrimental. ImageNet-64. As a ﬁnal experiment, we trained a class-conditional ImageNet-64 model from scratch using our proposed training improvements.

(b) Effect of Schurn on unconditional CIFAR-10 with 256 steps (NFE = 511). For the original training setup of Song et al. [49], stochastic sampling is highly beneﬁcial (blue, green), while deterministic sampling (Schurn = 0) leads to relatively poor FID. For our training setup, the situation is reversed (orange, red); stochastic sampling is not only unnecessary but harmful. (c) Effect of Schurn on class-conditional ImageNet-64 with 256 steps (NFE = 511). In this more challenging scenario, stochastic sampling turns out to be useful again. Our training setup improves the results for both deterministic and stochastic sampling. 1.36 compared to the previous record of 1.48 [17]. We used the ADM architecture [9] with no changes, and trained it using our conﬁg E with minimal tuning; see Appendix F.3 for details. We did not ﬁnd overﬁtting to be a concern, and thus chose to not employ augmentation regularization. As shown in Figure 5c, the optimal amount of stochastic sampling was much lower than with the pre-trained model, but unlike with CIFAR-10, stochastic sampling was clearly better than deterministic sampling. This suggests that more diverse datasets continue to beneﬁt from stochastic sampling. 6 Conclusions Our approach of putting diffusion models to a common framework exposes a modular design. This allows a targeted investigation of individual components, potentially helping to better cover the viable design space. In our tests this let us simply replace the samplers in various earlier models, drastically improving the results. For example, in ImageNet-64 our sampler turned an average model (FID 2.07) to a challenger (1.55) for the previous SOTA model (1.48) [ 17], and with training improvements achieved SOTA FID of 1.36. We also obtained new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 while using only 35 model evaluations, deterministic sampling, and a small network. The current high-resolution diffusion models rely either on separate super-resolution steps [17, 36, 40], subspace projection [23], very large networks [9, 49], or hybrid approaches [39, 42, 53] — we believe that our contributions are orthogonal to these extensions. That said, many of our parameter values may need to be re-adjusted for higher resolution datasets. Furthermore, we feel that the precise interaction between stochastic sampling and the training objective remains an interesting question for future work. Societal impact. Our advances in sample quality can potentially amplify negative societal effects when used in a large-scale system like DALL·E 2, including types of disinformation or emphasizing sterotypes and harmful biases [34]. The training and sampling of diffusion models needs a lot of electricity; our project consumed ∼250MWh on an in-house cluster of NVIDIA V100s. Acknowledgments.

The original DDIM [47] and iDDPM [37] samplers are compared to ours in both deterministic and stochastic settings (Sections 3 and 4). Figure 7 shows the corresponding results that we obtain by training the model from scratch using our improved training conﬁguration (Section 5). The original samplers and training conﬁgurations by Song et al. [ 49] are compared to ours in Figures 8 and 9 (unconditional CIFAR-10 [ 29]), Figure 10 (class-conditional CIFAR-10), and Figure 11 (FFHQ [27] and AFHQv2 [7]). For ease of comparison, the same latent codes x0 are used for each dataset/scenario across different training conﬁgurations and ODE choices. Figure 12 shows generated image quality with various NFE when using deterministic sampling. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the numerical results on deterministic and stochastic sampling methods in various datasets, previously shown as functions of NFE in Figures 2 and 4. B Derivation of formulas B.1 Original ODE / SDE formulation from previous work Song et al. [49] deﬁne their forward SDE (Eq. 5 in [49]) as dx= f(x,t) dt+ g(t) dωt, (9) where ωt is the standard Wiener process and f(·,t) : Rd →Rd and g(·) : R →R are the drift and diffusion coefﬁcients, respectively, where dis the dimensionality of the dataset. These coefﬁcients are selected differently for the variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE) formulations, and f(·) is always of the form f(x,t) = f(t) x, where f(·) : R →R. Thus, the SDE can be equivalently written as dx= f(t) xdt+ g(t) dωt. (10) The perturbation kernels of this SDE (Eq. 29 in [49]) have the general form p0t ( x(t) |x(0) ) = N ( x(t); s(t) x(0), s(t)2 σ(t)2 I ) , (11) where N(x; µ,Σ) denotes the probability density function of N(µ,Σ) evaluated at x, s(t) = exp (∫ t 0 f(ξ) dξ ) , and σ(t) = √∫ t 0 g(ξ)2 s(ξ)2 dξ. (12) The marginal distribution pt(x) is obtained by integrating the perturbation kernels over x(0): pt(x) = ∫ Rd p0t(x|x0) pdata(x0) dx0. (13) Song et al. [49] deﬁne the probability ﬂow ODE (Eq. 13 in [49]) so that it obeys this same pt(x): dx= [ f(t) x−1 2 g(t)2 ∇xlog pt(x) ] dt. (14) B.2 Our ODE formulation (Eq. 1 and Eq. 4) The original ODE formulation (Eq. 14) is built around the functions f and gthat correspond directly to speciﬁc terms that appear in the formula; the properties of the marginal distribution (Eq. 12) can only be derived indirectly based on these functions. However, f and gare of little practical interest in themselves, whereas the marginal distributions are of utmost importance in terms of training the model in the ﬁrst place, bootstrapping the sampling process, and understanding how the ODE behaves in practice.

Let us start by expressing the marginal distribution of Eq. 13 in closed form: pt(x) = ∫ Rd p0t(x|x0) pdata(x0) dx0 (15) = ∫ Rd pdata(x0) [ N ( x; s(t) x0, s(t)2 σ(t)2 I )] dx0 (16) = ∫ Rd pdata(x0) [ s(t)−d N ( x/s(t); x0, σ(t)2 I )] dx0 (17) = s(t)−d ∫ Rd pdata(x0) N ( x/s(t); x0, σ(t)2 I ) dx0 (18) = s(t)−d [ pdata ∗N ( 0, σ(t)2 I )]( x/s(t) ) , (19) where pa ∗pb denotes the convolution of probability density functions pa and pb. The expression inside the brackets corresponds to a molliﬁed version of pdata obtained by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the samples. Let us denote this distribution by p(x; σ): p(x; σ) = pdata ∗N ( 0, σ(t)2 I ) and pt(x) = s(t)−d p ( x/s(t); σ(t) ) . (20) We can now express the probability ﬂow ODE (Eq. 14) using p(x; σ) instead of pt(x): dx = [ f(t)x−1 2 g(t)2 ∇xlog [ pt(x) ]] dt (21) = [ f(t)x−1 2 g(t)2 ∇xlog [ s(t)−d p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )]] dt (22) = [ f(t)x−1 2 g(t)2 [ ∇xlog s(t)−d + ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )]] dt (23) = [ f(t)x−1 2 g(t)2 ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] dt. (24) 21Next, let us rewrite f(t) in terms of s(t) based on Eq. 12: exp (∫ t 0 f(ξ) dξ ) = s(t) (25) ∫ t 0 f(ξ) dξ = log s(t) (26) d [∫ t 0 f(ξ) dξ ]/ dt = d [ log s(t) ] /dt (27) f(t) = ˙ s(t)/s(t). (28) Similarly, we can also rewrite g(t) in terms of σ(t): √∫ t 0 g(ξ)2 s(ξ)2 dξ = σ(t) (29) ∫ t 0 g(ξ)2 s(ξ)2 dξ = σ(t)2 (30) d [∫ t 0 g(ξ)2 s(ξ)2 dξ ]/ dt = d [ σ(t)2] /dt (31) g(t)2/s(t)2 = 2 ˙ σ(t) σ(t) (32) g(t)/s(t) = √ 2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) (33) g(t) = s(t) √ 2 ˙σ(t) σ(t). (34) Finally, substitute f (Eq. 28) and g(Eq. 34) into the ODE of Eq. 24: dx = [ [f(t)] x−1 2 [g(t)]2 ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] dt (35) = [[ ˙s(t)/s(t) ] x−1 2 [ s(t) √ 2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) ]2 ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] dt (36) = [[ ˙s(t)/s(t) ] x−1 2 [ 2 s(t)2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) ] ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] dt (37) = [˙s(t) s(t) x−s(t)2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) ∇xlog p ( x s(t); σ(t) )] dt. (38) Thus we have obtained Eq. 4 in the main paper, and Eq. 1 is recovered by setting s(t) = 1: dx= −˙σ(t) σ(t) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt. (39) Our formulation (Eq. 4) highlights the fact that every realization of the probability ﬂow ODE is simply a reparameterization of the same canonical ODE; changing σ(t) corresponds to reparameterizing t, whereas changing s(t) corresponds to reparameterizing x. B.3 Denoising score matching (Eq. 2 and Eq. 3) For the sake of completeness, we derive the connection between score matching and denoising for a ﬁnite dataset. For a more general treatment and further background on the topic, see Hyvärinen [22] and Vincent [54]. Let us assume that our training set consists of a ﬁnite number of samples {y1,..., yY}. This implies pdata(x) is represented by a mixture of Dirac delta distributions: pdata(x) = 1 Y Y∑ i=1 δ ( x−yi ) , (40) 22which allows us to also express p(x; σ) in closed form based on Eq. 20: p(x; σ) = pdata ∗N ( 0, σ(t)2 I ) (41) = ∫ Rd pdata(x0) N ( x; x0, σ2 I ) dx0 (42) = ∫ Rd [ 1 Y Y∑ i=1 δ ( x0 −yi ) ] N ( x; x0, σ2 I ) dx0 (43) = 1 Y Y∑ i=1 ∫ Rd N ( x; x0, σ2 I ) δ ( x0 −yi ) dx0 (44) = 1 Y Y∑ i=1 N ( x; yi, σ2 I ) . (45) Let us now consider the denoising score matching loss of Eq. 2. By expanding the expectations, we can rewrite the formula as an integral over the noisy samples x: L(D; σ) = Ey∼pdata En∼N(0,σ2I) D(y+ n; σ) −y 2 2 (46) = Ey∼pdata Ex∼N(y,σ2I) D(x; σ) −y 2 2 (47) = Ey∼pdata ∫ Rd N(x; y, σ2 I) D(x; σ) −y 2 2 dx (48) = 1 Y Y∑ i=1 ∫ Rd N(x; yi, σ2 I) D(x; σ) −yi 2 2 dx (49) = ∫ Rd 1 Y Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) D(x; σ) −yi 2 2    =: L(D;x,σ) dx. (50) Eq. 50 means that we can minimize L(D; σ) by minimizing L(D; x,σ) independently for each x: D(x; σ) = arg minD(x;σ) L(D; x,σ). (51) This is a convex optimization problem; its solution is uniquely identiﬁed by setting the gradient w.r.t. D(x; σ) to zero: 0 = ∇D(x;σ) [ L(D; x,σ) ] (52) 0 = ∇D(x;σ) [ 1 Y Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) D(x; σ) −yi 2 2 ] (53) 0 = Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) ∇D(x;σ) [D(x; σ) −yi 2 2 ] (54) 0 = Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) [ 2 D(x; σ) −2 yi ] (55) 0 = [ Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) ] D(x; σ) − Y∑ i=1 N(x; yi, σ2 I) yi (56) D(x; σ) = ∑ iN(x; yi, σ2 I) yi∑ iN(x; yi, σ2 I) , (57) which gives a closed-form solution for the ideal denoiser D(x; σ). Note that Eq. 57 is feasible to compute in practice for small datasets — we show the results for CIFAR-10 in Figure 1b. 23Next, let us consider the score of the distribution p(x; σ) deﬁned in Eq. 45: ∇xlog p(x; σ) = ∇xp(x; σ) p(x; σ) (58) = ∇x [ 1 Y ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I )] [ 1 Y ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I )] (59) = ∑ i∇xN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) . (60) We can simplify the numerator of Eq. 60 further: ∇xN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) = ∇x [ ( 2πσ2)−d 2 exp ∥x−yi∥2 2 −2 σ2 ] (61) = ( 2πσ2)−d 2 ∇x [ exp ∥x−yi∥2 2 −2 σ2 ] (62) = [ ( 2πσ2)−d 2 exp ∥x−yi∥2 2 −2 σ2 ] ∇x [ ∥x−yi∥2 2 −2 σ2 ] (63) = N ( x; yi, σ2 I ) ∇x [ ∥x−yi∥2 2 −2 σ2 ] (64) = N ( x; yi, σ2 I )[yi −x σ2 ] . (65) Let us substitute the result back to Eq. 60: ∇xlog p(x; σ) = ∑ i∇xN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) (66) = ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I )[ yi−x σ2 ] ∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) (67) = (∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) yi∑ iN ( x; yi, σ2 I ) −x ) / σ2. (68) Notice that the fraction in Eq. 68 is identical to Eq. 57. We can thus equivalently write Eq. 68 as ∇xlog p(x; σ) = ( D(x; σ) −x ) /σ2, (69) which matches Eq. 3 in the main paper. B.4 Evaluating our ODE in practice (Algorithm 1) Let us considerxto be a scaled version of an original, non-scaled variableˆxand substitute x= s(t) ˆx into the score term that appears in our scaled ODE (Eq. 4): ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) ) (70) = ∇[s(t)ˆx] log p ( [s(t) ˆx]/s(t); σ(t) ) (71) = ∇s(t)ˆxlog p (ˆx; σ(t) ) (72) = 1 s(t) ∇ˆxlog p (ˆx; σ(t) ) . (73) We can further rewrite this with respect to D(·) using Eq. 3: ∇xlog p ( x/s(t); σ(t) ) = 1 s(t)σ(t)2 ( D (ˆx; σ(t) ) −ˆx ) . (74) 24Let us now substitute Eq. 74 into Eq. 4, approximating the ideal denoiserD(·) with our trained model Dθ(·): dx = [ ˙s(t) x/s(t) −s(t)2 ˙σ(t) σ(t) [ 1 s(t)σ(t)2 ( Dθ (ˆx; σ(t) ) −ˆx )]] dt (75) = [ ˙s(t) s(t) x−˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) ( Dθ (ˆx; σ(t) ) −ˆx )] dt. (76) Finally, backsubstitute ˆx= x/s(t): dx = [ ˙s(t) s(t) x−˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) ( Dθ ( [ˆx]; σ(t) ) −[ˆx] )] dt (77) = [ ˙s(t) s(t) x−˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) ( Dθ ( [x/s(t)]; σ(t) ) −[x/s(t)] )] dt (78) = [ ˙s(t) s(t) x−˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) Dθ ( x/s(t); σ(t) ) + ˙σ(t) σ(t) x ] dt (79) = [( ˙σ(t) σ(t) + ˙s(t) s(t) ) x−˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) Dθ ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] dt. (80) We can equivalenty write Eq. 80 as dx/dt= (˙σ(t) σ(t) + ˙s(t) s(t) ) x− ˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) Dθ ( x s(t); σ(t) ) , (81) matching lines 4 and 7 of Algorithm 1. B.5 Our SDE formulation (Eq. 6) We derive the SDE of Eq. 6 by the following strategy: • The desired marginal densities p ( x; σ(t) ) are convolutions of the data density pdata and an isotropic Gaussian density with standard deviation σ(t) (see Eq. 20). Hence, considered as a function of the time t, the density evolves according to a heat diffusion PDE with time-varying diffusivity. As a ﬁrst step, we ﬁnd this PDE. • We then use the Fokker–Planck equation to recover a family of SDEs for which the density evolves according to this PDE. Eq. 6 is obtained from a suitable parametrization of this family. B.5.1 Generating the marginals by heat diffusion We consider the time evolution of a probability density q(x,t). Our goal is to ﬁnd a PDE whose solution with the initial value q(x,0) := pdata(x) is q(x,t) = p ( x,σ(t) ) . That is, the PDE should reproduce the marginals we postulate in Eq. 20. The desired marginals are convolutions of pdata with isotropic normal distributions of time-varying standard deviation σ(t), and as such, can be generated by the heat equation with time-varying diffusivity κ(t). The situation is most conveniently analyzed in the Fourier domain, where the marginal densities are simply pointwise products of a Gaussian function and the transformed data density. To ﬁnd the diffusivity that induces the correct standard deviations, we ﬁrst write down the heat equation PDE: ∂q(x,t) ∂t = κ(t)∆xq(x,t). (82) The Fourier transformed counterpart of Eq. 82, where the transform is taken along the x-dimension, is given by ∂ˆq(ν,t) ∂t = −κ(t)|ν|2 ˆq(ν,t). (83) The target solution q(x,t) and its Fourier transform ˆq(ν,t) are given by Eq. 20: q(x,t) = p ( x; σ(t) ) = pdata(x) ∗N ( 0, σ(t)2 I ) (84) ˆq(ν,t) = ˆ pdata(ν) exp ( −1 2 |ν|2 σ(t)2 ) . (85) 25Differentiating the target solution along the time axis, we have ∂ˆq(ν,t) ∂t = −˙σ(t)σ(t) |ν|2 ˆpdata(ν) exp ( −1 2 |ν|2 σ(t)2 ) (86) = −˙σ(t)σ(t) |ν|2 ˆq(ν,t). (87) Eqs. 83 and 87 share the same left hand side. Equating them allows us to solve for κ(t) that generates the desired evolution: −κ(t)|ν|2 ˆq(ν,t) = −˙σ(t)σ(t) |ν|2 ˆq(ν,t) (88) κ(t) = ˙ σ(t)σ(t). (89) To summarize, the desired marginal densities corresponding to noise levels σ(t) are generated by the PDE ∂q(x,t) ∂t = ˙σ(t)σ(t)∆xq(x,t) (90) from the initial density q(x,0) = pdata(x). B.5.2 Derivation of our SDE Given an SDE dx= f(x,t) dt + g(x,t) dωt, (91) the Fokker–Planck PDE describes the time evolution of its solution probability density r(x,t) as ∂r(x,t) ∂t = −∇x· ( f(x,t) r(x,t) ) + 1 2 ∇x∇x : ( D(x,t) r(x,t) ) , (92) where Dij = ∑ kgikgjk is the diffusion tensor. We consider the special case g(x,t) = g(t) I of x-independent white noise addition, whereby the equation simpliﬁes to ∂r(x,t) ∂t = −∇x· ( f(x,t) r(x,t) ) + 1 2 g(t)2 ∆xr(x,t). (93) We are seeking an SDE whose solution density is described by the PDE in Eq. 90. Setting r(x,t) = q(x,t) and equating Eqs. 93 and 90, we ﬁnd the sufﬁcient condition that the SDE must satisfy −∇x· ( f(x,t) q(x,t) ) + 1 2 g(t)2 ∆xq(x,t) = ˙ σ(t) σ(t) ∆xq(x,t) (94) ∇x· ( f(x,t) q(x,t) ) = ( 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t) ) ∆xq(x,t). (95) Any choice of functions f(x,t) and g(t) satisfying this equation constitute a sought after SDE. Let us now ﬁnd a speciﬁc family of such solutions. The key idea is given by the identity ∇x·∇x = ∆x. Indeed, if we set f(x,t) q(x,t) = υ(t) ∇xq(x,t) for any choice of υ(t), the term ∆xq(x,t) appears on both sides and cancels out: ∇x· ( υ(t) ∇xq(x,t) ) = ( 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t) ) ∆xq(x,t) (96) υ(t) ∆xq(x,t) = ( 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t) ) ∆xq(x,t) (97) υ(t) = 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t). (98) The stated f(x,t) is in fact proportional to the score function, as the formula matches the gradient of the logarithm of the density: f(x,t) = υ(t) ∇xq(x,t) q(x,t) (99) = υ(t) ∇xlog q(x,t) (100) = ( 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t) ) ∇xlog q(x,t). (101) 26Substituting this back into Eq. 91 and writing p(x; σ(t)) in place of q(x,t), we recover a family of SDEs whose solution densities have the desired marginals with noise levelsσ(t) for any choice of g(t): dx= ( 1 2 g(t)2 −˙σ(t) σ(t) ) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt + g(t) dωt. (102) The free parameter g(t) effectively speciﬁes the rate of noise replacement at any given time instance. The special case choice of g(t) = 0 corresponds to the probability ﬂow ODE. The parametrization by g(t) is not particularly intuitive, however. To obtain a more interpretable parametrization, we set g(t) = √ 2 β(t) σ(t), which yields the (forward) SDE of Eq. 6 in the main paper: dx+ = −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt + β(t)σ(t)2∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt+ √ 2β(t)σ(t) dωt. (103) The noise replacement is now proportional to the standard deviation σ(t) of the noise, with the proportionality factor β(t). Indeed, expanding the score function in the middle term according to Eq. 3 yields β(t) [ D ( x; σ(t) ) −x ] dt, which changes xproportionally to the negative noise component; the stochastic term injects new noise at the same rate. Intuitively, scaling the magnitude of Langevin exploration according to the current noise standard deviation is a reasonable baseline, as the data manifold is effectively “spread out” by this amount due to the blurring of the density. The reverse SDE used in denoising diffusion is simply obtained by applying the time reversal formula of Anderson [1] (as stated in Eq. 6 of Song et al. [49]) on Eq. 103; the entire effect of the reversal is a change of sign in the middle term. The scaled generalization of the SDE can be derived using a similar approach as with the ODE previously. As such, the derivation is omitted here. B.6 Our preconditioning and training (Eq. 8) Following Eq. 2, the denoising score matching loss for a given denoiser Dθ on a given noise level σ is given by L(Dθ; σ) = Ey∼pdata En∼N(0,σ2I) Dθ(y+ n; σ) −y 2 2. (104) We obtain overall training loss by taking a weighted expectation ofL(Dθ; σ) over the noise levels: L(Dθ) = Eσ∼ptrain [ λ(σ) L(Dθ; σ) ] (105) = Eσ∼ptrain [ λ(σ) Ey∼pdata En∼N(0,σ2I) Dθ(y+ n; σ) −y 2 2 ] (106) = Eσ∼ptrain Ey∼pdata En∼N(0,σ2I) [ λ(σ) Dθ(y+ n; σ) −y 2 2 ] (107) = Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ) Dθ(y+ n; σ) −y 2 2 ] , (108) where the noise levels are distributed according to σ∼ptrain and weighted by λ(σ). Using our deﬁnition of Dθ(·) from Eq. 7, we can further rewrite L(Dθ) as Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ) cskip(σ)(y+n) + cout(σ)Fθ ( cin(σ)(y+n);cnoise(σ) ) −y 2 2 ] (109) = Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ) cout(σ)Fθ ( cin(σ)(y+n);cnoise(σ) ) − ( y−cskip(σ)(y+ n) )2 2 ] (110) = Eσ,y,n [ λ(σ)cout(σ)2Fθ ( cin(σ)(y+n);cnoise(σ) ) − 1 cout(σ) ( y−cskip(σ)(y+n) )2 2 ] (111) = Eσ,y,n [ w(σ) Fθ ( cin(σ)(y+n);cnoise(σ) ) −Ftarget(y,n; σ) 2 2 ] , (112) which matches Eq. 8 and corresponds to traditional supervised training of Fθ using standard L2 loss with effective weight w(·) and target Ftarget(·) given by w(σ) = λ(σ) cout(σ)2 and Ftarget(y,n; σ) = 1 cout(σ) ( y−cskip(σ)(y+ n) ) , (113) We can now derive formulas forcin(σ), cout(σ), cskip(σ), and λ(σ) from ﬁrst principles, shown in the “Ours” column of Table 1. 27First, we require the training inputs of Fθ(·) to have unit variance: Vary,n [ cin(σ)(y+ n) ] = 1 (114) cin(σ)2 Vary,n [ y+ n ] = 1 (115) cin(σ)2( σ2 data + σ2) = 1 (116) cin(σ) = 1 /√ σ2 + σ2 data. (117) Second, we require the effective training target Ftarget to have unit variance: Vary,n [ Ftarget(y,n; σ) ] = 1 (118) Vary,n [ 1 cout(σ) ( y−cskip(σ)(y+ n) )] = 1 (119) 1 cout(σ)2 Vary,n [ y−cskip(σ)(y+ n) ] = 1 (120) cout(σ)2 = Var y,n [ y−cskip(σ)(y+ n) ] (121) cout(σ)2 = Var y,n [( 1 −cskip(σ) ) y+ cskip(σ) n ] (122) cout(σ)2 = ( 1 −cskip(σ) )2 σ2 data + cskip(σ)2 σ2. (123) Third, we select cskip(σ) to minimize cout(σ), so that the errors of Fθ are ampliﬁed as little as possible: cskip(σ) = arg mincskip(σ) cout(σ). (124) Since cout(σ) ≥0, we can equivalently write cskip(σ) = arg mincskip(σ) cout(σ)2. (125) This is a convex optimization problem; its solution is uniquely identiﬁed by setting the derivative w.r.t. cskip(σ) to zero: 0 = d [ cout(σ)2] /dcskip(σ) (126) 0 = d [( 1 −cskip(σ) )2 σ2 data + cskip(σ)2 σ2 ] /dcskip(σ) (127) 0 = σ2 data d [( 1 −cskip(σ) )2] /dcskip(σ) + σ2 d [ cskip(σ)2] /dcskip(σ) (128) 0 = σ2 data [ 2 cskip(σ) −2 ] + σ2 [ 2 cskip(σ) ] (129) 0 = ( σ2 + σ2 data ) cskip(σ) −σ2 data (130) cskip(σ) = σ2 data/ ( σ2 + σ2 data ) . (131) We can now substitute Eq. 131 into Eq. 123 to complete the formula for cout(σ): cout(σ)2 = ( 1 − [ cskip(σ) ])2 σ2 data + [ cskip(σ) ]2 σ2 (132) cout(σ)2 = ( 1 − [ σ2 data σ2 + σ2 data ])2 σ2 data + [ σ2 data σ2 + σ2 data ]2 σ2 (133) cout(σ)2 = [ σ2 σdata σ2 + σ2 data ]2 + [ σ2 data σ σ2 + σ2 data ]2 (134) cout(σ)2 = ( σ2 σdata )2 + ( σ2 data σ )2 ( σ2 + σ2 data )2 (135) cout(σ)2 = (σ·σdata)2 ( σ2 + σ2 data ) ( σ2 + σ2 data )2 (136) cout(σ)2 = (σ·σdata)2 σ2 + σ2 data (137) cout(σ) = σ·σdata /√ σ2 + σ2 data. (138) 28Fourth, we require the effective weight w(σ) to be uniform across noise levels: w(σ) = 1 (139) λ(σ) cout(σ)2 = 1 (140) λ(σ) = 1 /cout(σ)2 (141) λ(σ) = 1 /[ σ·σdata√ σ2 + σ2 data ]2 (142) λ(σ) = 1 /[(σ·σdata)2 σ2 + σ2 data ] (143) λ(σ) = ( σ2 + σ2 data ) /(σ·σdata)2. (144) We follow previous work and initialize the output layer weights to zero. Consequently, upon initialization Fθ(·) = 0 and the expected value of the loss at each noise level is 1. This can be seen by substituting the choices of λ(σ) and cskip(σ) into Eq. 109, considered at a ﬁxed σ: Ey,n [ λ(σ) cskip(σ)(y+n) + cout(σ)Fθ ( cin(σ)(y+n);cnoise(σ) ) −y 2 2 ] (145) = Ey,n [σ2 + σ2 data (σ·σdata)2  σ2 data σ2 + σ2 data (y+n) −y  2 2 ] (146) = Ey,n [σ2 + σ2 data (σ·σdata)2  σ2 datan−σ2y σ2 + σ2 data  2 2 ] (147) = Ey,n [ 1 σ2 + σ2 data  σdata σ n− σ σdata y  2 2 ] (148) = 1 σ2 + σ2 data Ey,n [σ2 data σ2 ⟨n,n⟩+ σ2 σ2 data ⟨y,y⟩−2⟨y,n⟩ ] (149) = 1 σ2 + σ2 data [σ2 data σ2 Var(n)   =σ2 + σ2 σ2 data Var(y)   =σ2 data −2 Cov(y,n)   =0 ] (150) = 1 (151) C Reframing previous methods in our framework In this section, we derive the formulas shown in Table 1 for previous methods, discuss the corre- sponding original samplers and pre-trained models, and detail the practical considerations associated with using them in our framework. In practice, the original implementations of these methods differ considerably in terms of the deﬁnitions of model inputs and outputs, dynamic range of image data, scaling of x, and interpretation of σ. We eliminate this variation by standardizing on a uniﬁed setup where the model always matches our deﬁnition of Fθ, image data is always represented in the continuous range [−1,1], and the details of xand σare always in agreement with Eq. 4. We minimize the accumulation of ﬂoating point round-off errors by always executing Algorithms 1 and 2 at double precision (float64). However, we still execute the network Fθ(·) at single precision (float32) to minimize runtime and remain faithful to previous work in terms of network architecture. C.1 Variance preserving formulation C.1.1 VP sampling Song et al. [49] deﬁne the VP SDE (Eq. 32 in [49]) as dx= −1 2 ( βmin + t ( βmax −βmin )) xdt+ √ βmin + t ( βmax −βmin ) dωt, (152) 29which matches Eq. 10 with the following choices for f and g: f(t) = −1 2 β(t), g(t) = √ β(t), and β(t) = ( βmax −βmin ) t+ βmin. (153) Let α(t) denote the integral of β(t): α(t) = ∫ t 0 β(ξ) dξ (154) = ∫ t 0 [( βmax −βmin ) ξ+ βmin ] dξ (155) = 1 2 ( βmax −βmin ) t2 + βmin t (156) = 1 2 βd t2 + βmin t, (157) where βd = βmax −βmin. We can now obtain the formula for σ(t) by substituting Eq. 153 into Eq. 12: σ(t) = √ ∫ t 0 [ g(ξ) ]2 [ s(ξ) ]2 dξ (158) = √ ∫ t 0 [√ β(ξ) ]2 [ 1/ √ eα(ξ)]2 dξ (159) = √∫ t 0 β(ξ) 1/eα(ξ) dξ (160) = √∫ t 0 ˙α(ξ) eα(ξ) dξ (161) = √ eα(t) −eα(0) (162) = √ e 1 2 βdt2+βmint −1, (163) which matches the “Schedule” row of Table 1. Similarly fors(t): s(t) = exp (∫ t 0 [ f(ξ) ] dξ ) (164) = exp (∫ t 0 [ −1 2 β(ξ) ] dξ ) (165) = exp ( −1 2 [∫ t 0 β(ξ) dξ ]) (166) = exp ( −1 2 α(t) ) (167) = 1 / √ eα(t) (168) = 1 / √ e 1 2 βdt2+βmint, (169) which matches the “Scaling” row of Table 1. We can equivalently write Eq. 169 in a slightly simpler form by utilizing Eq. 163: s(t) = 1/ √ σ(t)2 + 1. (170) Song et al. [ 49] choose to distribute the sampling time steps {t0,...,t N−1}at uniform intervals within [ϵs,1]. This corresponds to setting ti<N = 1 + i N−1 (ϵs −1), (171) which matches the “Time steps” row of Table 1. Finally, Song et al. [49] set βmin = 0.1, βmax = 20, and ϵs = 10−3 (Appendix C in [49]), and choose to represent images in the range [−1,1]. These choices are readily compatible with our formulation and are reﬂected by the “Parameters” section of Table 1. 30C.1.2 VP preconditioning In the VP case, Song et al. [49] approximate the score of pt(x) of Eq. 13 as1 ∇xlog pt(x) ≈ −1 ¯σ(t) Fθ ( x; (M−1)t )    score(x;Fθ,t) , (172) where M = 1000, Fθ denotes the network, and ¯σ(t) corresponds to the standard deviation of the perturbation kernel of Eq. 11. Let us expand the deﬁnitions of pt(x) and ¯σ(t) from Eqs. 20 and 11, respectively, and substitute x= s(t)ˆxto obtain the corresponding formula with respect to the non-scaled variable ˆx: ∇xlog [ p ( x/s(t); σ(t) )] ≈ − 1 [s(t)σ(t)] Fθ ( x; (M−1)t ) (173) ∇[s(t)ˆx] log p ( [s(t) ˆx]/s(t); σ(t) ) ≈ − 1 s(t)σ(t) Fθ ( [s(t) ˆx]; (M−1)t ) (174) 1 s(t) ∇ˆxlog p (ˆx; σ(t) ) ≈ − 1 s(t)σ(t) Fθ ( s(t) ˆx; (M−1)t ) (175) ∇ˆxlog p (ˆx; σ(t) ) ≈ − 1 σ(t) Fθ ( s(t) ˆx; (M−1)t ) . (176) We can now replace the left-hand side with Eq. 3 and expand the deﬁnition of s(t) from Eq. 170: [( D (ˆx; σ(t) ) −ˆx ) /σ(t)2 ] ≈ − 1 σ(t) Fθ ( s(t) ˆx; (M−1)t ) (177) D (ˆx; σ(t) ) ≈ ˆx−σ(t) Fθ ( s(t) ˆx; (M−1)t ) (178) D (ˆx; σ(t) ) ≈ ˆx−σ(t) Fθ ([ 1√ σ(t)2+1 ] ˆx; (M−1)t ) , (179) which can be further expressed in terms of σby replacing σ(t) →σand t→σ−1(σ): D(ˆx; σ) ≈ ˆx−σFθ ( 1√ σ2+1 ˆx; (M−1) σ−1(σ) ) . (180) We adopt the right-hand side of Eq. 180 as the deﬁnition of Dθ, obtaining Dθ(ˆx; σ) = 1 · cskip ˆx −σ cout ·Fθ ( 1√ σ2+1   cin ·ˆx; ( M−1) σ−1(σ)   cnoise ) , (181) where cskip, cout, cin, and cnoise match the “Network and preconditioning” section of Table 1. C.1.3 VP training Song et al. [49] deﬁne their training loss as2 Et∼U(ϵt,1),y∼pdata,¯n∼N(0,I) [¯σ(t) score ( s(t) y+ ¯σ(t) ¯n; Fθ,t ) + ¯n 2 2 ] , (182) where the deﬁnition of score(·) is the same as in Eq. 172. Let us simplify the formula by substituting ¯σ(t) = s(t)σ(t) and ¯n= n/σ(t), where n∼N(0,σ(t)2I): Et,y,¯n [s(t)σ(t) score ( s(t) y+ [s(t)σ(t)] ¯n; Fθ,t ) + ¯n 2 2 ] (183) = Et,y,n [s(t)σ(t) score ( s(t) y+ s(t)σ(t) [n/σ(t)]; Fθ,t ) + [n/σ(t)] 2 2 ] (184) = Et,y,n [s(t)σ(t) score ( s(t) (y+ n); Fθ,t ) + n/σ(t) 2 2 ] . (185) We can express score(·) in terms of Dθ(·) by combining Eqs. 172, 170, and 74: score ( s(t) x; Fθ,t ) = 1 s(t)σ(t)2 ( Dθ ( x; σ(t) ) −x ) . (186) 1https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/models/utils.py#L144 2https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/losses.py#L73 31Substituting this back into Eq. 185 gives Et,y,n [s(t)σ(t) [ 1 s(t)σ(t)2 ( Dθ ( y+ n; σ(t) ) −(y+ n) )] + 1 σ(t) n 2 2 ] (187) = Et,y,n [ 1 σ(t) ( Dθ ( y+ n; σ(t) ) −(y+ n) ) + 1 σ(t) n 2 2 ] (188) = Et,y,n [ 1 σ(t)2 Dθ ( y+ n; σ(t) ) −y 2 2 ] . (189) We can further express this in terms of σby replacing σ(t) →σand t→σ−1(σ): Eσ−1(σ)∼U(ϵt,1)    ptrain Ey,n [ 1 σ2  λ Dθ ( y+ n; σ ) −y 2 2 ] , (190) which matches Eq. 108 with the choices for ptrain and λshown in the “Training” section of Table 1. C.1.4 VP practical considerations The pre-trained VP model that we use on CIFAR-10 corresponds to the “DDPM++ cont. (VP)” checkpoint3 provided by Song et al. [49]. It contains a total of 62 million trainable parameters and supports a continuous range of noise levels σ ∈ [ σ(ϵt),σ(1) ] ≈[0.001,152], i.e., wider than our preferred sampling range [0.002,80]. We import the model directly as Fθ(·) and run Algorithms 1 and 2 using the deﬁnitions in Table 1. In Figure 2a, the differences between the original sampler (blue) and our reimplementation (orange) are explained by oversights in the implementation of Song et al. [ 49], also noted by Jolicoeur- Martineau et al. [24] (Appendix D in [24]). First, the original sampler employs an incorrect multiplier4 in the Euler step: it multiplies dx/dt by −1/N instead of (ϵs −1)/(N −1). Second, it either overshoots or undershoots on the last step by going fromtN−1 = ϵs to tN = ϵs −1/N, where tN <0 when N <1000. In practice, this means that the generated images contain noticeable noise that becomes quite severe with, e.g., N = 128. Our formulation avoids these issues, because the step sizes in Algorithm 1 are computed consistently from {ti}and tN = 0. C.2 Variance exploding formulation C.2.1 VE sampling in theory Song et al. [49] deﬁne the VE SDE (Eq. 30 in [49]) as dx= σmin (σmax σmin )t√ 2 log σmax σmin dωt, (191) which matches Eq. 10 with f(t) = 0, g(t) = σmin √ 2 logσd σt d, and σd = σmax/σmin. (192) The VE formulation does not employ scaling, which can be easily seen from Eq. 12: s(t) = exp (∫ t 0 [ f(ξ) ] dξ ) = exp (∫ t 0 [ 0 ] dξ ) = exp(0) = 1. (193) 3vp/cifar10_ddpmpp_continuous/checkpoint_8.pth, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xYjVMx10N9ivQQBIsEoXEeu9nvSGTBrC 4https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/sampling.py#L182 32Substituting Eq. 192 into Eq. 12 suggests the following form for σ(t): σ(t) = √ ∫ t 0 [ g(ξ) ]2 [ s(ξ) ]2 dξ (194) = √ ∫ t 0 [ σmin √2 logσd σξd ]2 [ 1 ]2 dξ (195) = √∫ t 0 σ2min [ 2 logσd ][ σ2ξd ] dξ (196) = σmin √∫ t 0 [ log ( σ2d )][( σ2d )ξ] dξ (197) = σmin √( σ2d )t − ( σ2d )0 (198) = σmin √ σ2td −1. (199) Eq. 199 is consistent with the perturbation kernel reported by Song et al. (Eq. 29 in [49]). However, we note that this does not fulﬁll their intended deﬁnition of σ(t) = σmin (σmax σmin )t (Appendix C in [49]). C.2.2 VE sampling in practice The original implementation 5 of Song et al. [ 49] uses reverse diffusion predictor 6 to integrate discretized reverse probability ﬂow7 of discretized VE SDE8. Put together, these yield the following update rule for xi+1: xi+1 = xi + 1 2 ( ¯σ2 i −¯σ2 i+1 ) ∇xlog ¯pi(x), (200) where ¯σi<N = σmin (σmax σmin )1−i/(N−1) and ¯σN = 0. (201) Interestingly, Eq. 200 is identical to the Euler iteration of our ODE with the following choices: s(t) = 1, σ(t) = √ t, and ti = ¯σ2 i. (202) These formulas match the “Sampling” section of Table 1, and their correctness can be veriﬁed by substituting them into line 5 of Algorithm 1: xi+1 = xi + (ti+1 −ti) di (203) = xi + (ti+1 −ti) [(˙σ(t) σ(t) + ˙s(t) s(t) ) x− ˙σ(t)s(t) σ(t) D ( x s(t); σ(t) )] (204) = xi + (ti+1 −ti) [˙σ(t) σ(t) x− ˙σ(t) σ(t) D ( x; σ(t) )] (205) = xi −(ti+1 −ti) ˙σ(t) σ(t) [( D ( x; σ(t) ) −x )/ σ(t)2 ] (206) = xi −(ti+1 −ti) ˙σ(t) σ(t) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) (207) = xi −(ti+1 −ti) [ 1 2 √ t ][√ t ] ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) (208) = xi + 1 2 (ti −ti+1) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) (209) = xi + 1 2 ( ¯σ2 i −¯σ2 i+1 ) ∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) , (210) 5https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch 6https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/sampling.py#L191 7https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/sde_lib.py#L102 8https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/sde_lib.py#L246 33which is made identical to Eq. 200 by the choice ¯pi(x) = p ( x; σ(ti) ) . Finally, Song et al. [49] set σmin = 0.01 and σmax = 50 for CIFAR-10 (Appendix C in [49]), and choose to represent their images in the range [0,1] to match previous SMLD models. Since our standardized range [−1,1] is twice as large, we must multiply σmin and σmax by 2×to compensate. The “Parameters” section of Table 1 reﬂects these adjusted values. C.2.3 VE preconditioning In the VE case, Song et al. [49] approximate the score of pt(x) of Eq. 13 directly as9 ∇xlog pt(x) ≈ ¯Fθ ( x; σ(t) ) , (211) where the network ¯Fθ is designed to include additional pre-10 and11 postprocessing12 steps: ¯Fθ ( x; σ ) = 1 σ Fθ ( 2x−1; log(σ) ) . (212) For consistency, we handle the pre- and postprocessing using {cskip,cout,cin,cnoise}as opposed to baking them into the network itself. We cannot use Eqs. 211 and 212 directly in our framework, however, because they assume that the images are represented in range [0,1]. In order to use [−1,1] instead, we replace pt(x) →pt(2x−1), x→1 2 x+ 1 2 and σ→1 2 σ: ∇[ 1 2 x+ 1 2 ] log pt ( 2 [1 2 x+ 1 2 ] −1 ) ≈ 1 [ 1 2 σ] Fθ ( 2 [1 2 x+ 1 2 ] −1; log [1 2 σ ]) (213) 2 ∇xlog pt(x) ≈ 2 σ Fθ ( x; log (1 2 σ )) (214) ∇xlog p(x; σ) ≈ 1 σ Fθ ( x; log (1 2 σ )) . (215) We can now express the model in terms of Dθ(·) by replacing the left-hand side of Eq. 215 with Eq. 3: ( Dθ ( x; σ ) −x ) /σ2 = 1 σ Fθ ( x; log (1 2 σ )) (216) Dθ ( x; σ ) = 1 · cskip x+ σ· cout Fθ ( 1 · cin x; log (1 2 σ )    cnoise ) , (217) where cskip, cout, cin, and cnoise match the “Network and preconditioning” section of Table 1. C.2.4 VE training Song et al. [ 49] deﬁne their training loss similarly for VP and VE, so we can reuse Eq. 185 by borrowing the deﬁnition of score(·) from Eq. 216: Et,y,n [s(t)σ(t) score ( s(t) (y+ n); Fθ,t ) + n/σ(t) 2 2 ] (218) = Et,y,n [σ(t) score ( y+ n; Fθ,t ) + n/σ(t) 2 2 ] (219) = Et,y,n [σ(t) [( Dθ ( y+ n; σ(t) ) −(y+ n) ) /σ(t)2 ] + n/σ(t) 2 2 ] (220) = Et,y,n [ 1 σ(t)2 Dθ ( y+ n; σ(t) ) −y 2 2 ] . (221) For VE training, the original implementation 13 deﬁnes σ(t) = σmin (σmax σmin )t . We can thus rewrite Eq. 221 as Eln(σ)∼U(ln(σmin),ln(σmax))    ptrain Ey,n [ 1 σ2  λ Dθ ( y+ n; σ ) −y 2 2 ] , (222) which matches Eq. 108 with the choices for ptrain and λshown in the “Training” section of Table 1. 9https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/models/utils.py#L163 10https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/models/ncsnpp.py#L239 11https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/models/ncsnpp.py#L261 12https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/models/ncsnpp.py#L379 13https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch/blob/1618ddea340f3e4a2ed7852a0694a809775cf8d0/sde_lib.py#L234 34C.2.5 VE practical considerations The pre-trained VE model that we use on CIFAR-10 corresponds to the “NCSN++ cont. (VE)” checkpoint14 provided by Song et al. [49]. It contains a total of 63 million trainable parameters and supports a continuous range of noise levels σ ∈ [ σ(ϵt),σ(1) ] ≈[0.02,100]. This is narrower than our preferred sampling range [0.002,80], so we set σmin = 0.02 in all related experiments. Note that this limitation is lifted by our training improvements in conﬁg E, so we revert back to using σmin = 0.002 with conﬁgs E and F in Table 2. When importing the model, we remove the pre- and postprocessing steps shown in Eq. 212 to stay consistent with the deﬁnition of Fθ(·) in Eq. 217. With these changes, we can run Algorithms 1 and 2 using the deﬁnitions in Table 1. In Figure 2b, the differences between the original sampler (blue) and our reimplementation (orange) are explained by ﬂoating point round-off errors that the original implementation suffers from at high step counts. Our results are more accurate in these cases because we represent xi at double precision in Algorithm 1. C.3 Improved DDPM and DDIM C.3.1 DDIM ODE formulation Song et al. [47] make the observation that their deterministic DDIM sampler can be expressed as Euler integration of the following ODE (Eq. 14 in [47]): dx(t) = ϵ(t) θ ( x(t)√ σ(t)2 + 1 ) dσ(t), (223) where x(t) is a scaled version of the iterate that appears in their discrete update formula (Eq. 10 in [47]) and ϵθ is a model trained to predict the normalized noise vector, i.e., ϵ(t) θ ( x(t)/ √ σ(t)2 + 1 ) ≈ n(t)/σ(t) for x(t) = y(t) + n(t). In our formulation, Dθ is trained to approximate the clean signal, i.e., Dθ ( x(t); σ(t) ) ≈y, so we can reinterpret ϵθ in terms of Dθ as follows: n(t) = x(t) −y(t) (224)[ n(t)/σ(t) ] = ( x(t) − [ y(t) ]) /σ(t) (225) ϵ(t) θ ( x(t)/ √ σ(t)2 + 1 ) = ( x(t) −Dθ ( x(t); σ(t) )) /σ(t). (226) Assuming ideal ϵ(·) and D(·) in L2 sense, we can further simplify the above formula using Eq. 3: ϵ(t)( x(t)/ √ σ(t)2 + 1 ) = ( x(t) −D ( x(t); σ(t) )) /σ(t) (227) = −σ(t) [( D ( x(t); σ(t) ) −x(t) ) /σ(t)2 ] (228) = −σ(t) ∇x(t) log p ( x(t); σ(t) ) . (229) Substituting Eq. 229 back into Eq. 223 gives dx(t) = −σ(t) ∇x(t) log p ( x(t); σ(t) ) dσ(t), (230) which we can further simplify by setting σ(t) = t: dx= −t∇xlog p ( x; σ(t) ) dt. (231) This matches our Eq. 4 with s(t) = 1 and σ(t) = t, reﬂected by the “Sampling” section of Table 1. C.3.2 iDDPM time step discretization The original DDPM formulation of Ho et al. [ 16] deﬁnes the forward process (Eq. 2 in [ 16]) as a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise to ¯x0 ∼pdata according to a discrete variance schedule {β1,...,β T}: q(¯xt |¯xt−1) = N (¯xt; √ 1 −βt ¯xt−1, βt I ) . (232) 14ve/cifar10_ncsnpp_continuous/checkpoint_24.pth, https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b0gy_LLgO_DaQBgoWXwlVnL_rcAUgREh 35The corresponding transition probability from ¯x0 to ¯xt (Eq. 4 in [16]) is given by q(¯xt |¯x0) = N (¯xt; √¯αt ¯x0, (1 −¯αt) I ) , where ¯αt = t∏ s=1 (1 −βs). (233) Ho et al. [16] deﬁne {βt}based on a linear schedule and then calculate the corresponding {¯αt}from Eq. 233. Alternatively, one can also deﬁne {¯αt}ﬁrst and then solve for {βt}: ¯αt = t∏ s=1 (1 −βs) (234) ¯αt = ¯ αt−1 (1 −βt) (235) βt = 1 − ¯αt ¯αt−1 . (236) The improved DDPM formulation of Nichol and Dhariwal [37] employs a cosine schedule for ¯αt (Eq. 17 in [37]), deﬁned as ¯αt = f(t) f(0), where f(t) = cos2 (t/T + s 1 + s ·π 2 ) , (237) where s= 0.008. In their implementation15, however, Nichol et al. leave out the division by f(0) and simply deﬁne16 ¯αt = cos2 (t/T + s 1 + s ·π 2 ) . (238) To prevent singularities near t= T, they also clamp βt to 0.999. We can express the clamping in terms of ¯αt by utilizing Eq. 233 and Eq. 234: ¯α′ t = t∏ s=1 ( 1 −[β′ s] ) (239) = t∏ s=1 ( 1 −min ( [βs], 0.999) ) (240) = t∏ s=1 ( 1 −min ( 1 − ¯αs ¯αs−1 , 0.999 )) (241) = t∏ s=1 max ( ¯αs ¯αs−1 , 0.001 ) . (242) Let us now reinterpret the above formulas in our uniﬁed framework. Recall from Table 1 that we denote the original iDDPM sampling steps by {uj}in the order of descending noise level σ(uj), where j ∈{0,...,M }. To harmonize the notation of Eq. 233, Eq. 238, and Eq. 239, we thus have to replace T −→M and t−→M −j: q(¯xj |¯xM) = N (¯xj; √ ¯α′ j ¯xM, (1 −¯α′ j) I ) , (243) ¯αj = cos 2 ((M −j)/M+ C2 1 + C2 ·π 2 ) , and (244) ¯α′ j = j∏ s=M−1 max ( ¯αj ¯αj+1 , C1 ) = ¯α′ j+1 max ( ¯αj ¯αj+1 , C1 ) , (245) where the constants are C1 = 0.001 and C2 = 0.008. 15https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion 16https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion/blob/783b6740edb79fdb7d063250db2c51cc9545dcd1/improved_diffusion/gaussian_ diffusion.py#L39 36We can further simplify Eq. 244: ¯αj = cos 2 ((M −j)/M+ C2 1 + C2 ·π 2 ) (246) = cos 2 (π 2 (1 + C2) −j/M 1 + C2 ) (247) = cos 2 (π 2 −π 2 j M(1 + C2) ) (248) = sin 2 (π 2 j M(1 + C2) ) , (249) giving the formula shown in the “Parameters” section of Table 1. To harmonize the deﬁnitions of xand ¯x, we must match the perturbation kernel of Eq. 11 with the transition probability of Eq. 243 for each time step t= uj: p0t ( x(uj) |x(0) ) = q(¯xj |¯xM) (250) N ( x(uj); s(t) x(0), s(uj)2 σ(uj)2 I ) = N ( ¯xj; √ ¯α′ j ¯xM, ( 1 −¯α′ j ) I ) . (251) Substituting s(t) = 1 and σ(t) = tfrom Appendix C.3.1, as well as ¯xM = x(0): N ( x(uj); x(0), u2 j I ) = N ( ¯xj; √ ¯α′ j x(0), ( 1 −¯α′ j ) I ) . (252) We can match the means of these two distributions by deﬁning ¯xj = √ ¯α′ j x(uj): N ( x(uj); x(0), u2 j I ) = N (√ ¯α′ j x(uj); √ ¯α′ j x(0), ( 1 −¯α′ j ) I ) (253) = N ( x(uj); x(0), 1 −¯α′ j ¯α′ j I ) . (254) Matching the variances and solving for ¯α′ j gives u2 j = (1 −¯α′ j) / ¯α′ j (255) u2 j ¯α′ j = 1 −¯α′ j (256) u2 j ¯α′ j + ¯α′ j = 1 (257) (u2 j + 1) ¯α′ j = 1 (258) ¯α′ j = 1 /(u2 j + 1). (259) Finally, we can expand the left-hand side using Eq. 245 and solve for uj−1: ¯α′ j+1 max(¯αj/¯αj+1, C1) = 1 /(u2 j + 1) (260) ¯α′ j max(¯αj−1/¯αj, C1) = 1 /(u2 j−1 + 1) (261) [ 1 /(u2 j + 1) ] max(¯αj−1/¯αj, C1) = 1 /(u2 j−1 + 1) (262) max(¯αj−1/¯αj, C1) (u2 j−1 + 1) = u2 j + 1 (263) u2 j−1 + 1 = ( u2 j + 1) / max(¯αj−1/¯αj, C1) (264) uj−1 = √ u2 j + 1 max(¯αj−1/¯αj, C1) −1, (265) giving a recurrence formula for {uj}, bootstrapped by uM = 0, that matches the “Time steps” row of Table 1. 37C.3.3 iDDPM preconditioning and training We can solve Dθ(·) from Eq. 227 by substituting σ(t) = tfrom Appendix C.3.1: ϵ(j) θ ( x/ √ σ2 + 1 ) = ( x−Dθ(x; σ) ) /σ (266) Dθ(x; σ) = x−σϵ(j) θ ( x/ √ σ2 + 1 ) . (267) We choose to deﬁne Fθ(·; j) = ϵ(j) θ (·) and solve jfrom σby ﬁnding the nearest uj: Dθ(x; σ) = 1 · cskip x −σ cout ·Fθ ( 1√ σ2+1   cin ·x; arg min j|uj −σ|    cnoise ) , (268) where cskip, cout, cin, and cnoise match the “Network and preconditioning” section of Table 1. Note that Eq. 268 is identical to the VP preconditioning formula in Eq. 181. Furthermore, Nichol and Dhariwal [ 37] deﬁne their main training loss Lsimple (Eq. 14 in [ 37]) the same way as Song et al. [49], with σdrawn uniformly from {uj}. Thus, we can reuse Eq. 190 with σ = uj, j ∼U(0,M −1), and λ(σ) = 1 /σ2, matching the “Training” section of Table 1. In addition to Lsimple, Nichol and Dhariwal [ 37] also employ a secondary loss term Lvlb; we refer the reader to Section 3.1 in [37] for details. C.3.4 iDDPM practical considerations The pre-trained iDDPM model that we use on ImageNet-64 corresponds to the “ADM (dropout)” checkpoint17 provided by Dhariwal and Nichol [9]. It contains 296 million trainable parameters and supports a discrete set of M = 1000 noise levels σ∈{uj}≈{ 20291, 642, 321, 214, 160, 128, 106, 92, 80, 71, ... , 0.0064}. The fact that we can only evaluate Fθ these speciﬁc choices of σpresents three practical challenges: 1. In the context of DDIM, we must choose how to resample {uj}to yield {ti}for N ̸= M. Song et al. [47] employ a simple resampling scheme where ti = uk·i for resampling factor k∈Z+. This scheme, however, requires that1000 ≡0 (mod N), which limits the possible choices for N considerably. Nichol and Dhariwal [37], on the other hand, employ a more ﬂexible scheme where ti = uj with j = ⌊(M −1)/(N −1) ·i⌋. We note, however, that in practice the values of uj<8 are considerably larger than our preferred σmax = 80. We choose to skip these values by deﬁning j = ⌊j0 + (M −1 −j0)/(N −1) ·i⌋with j0 = 8, matching the “Time steps” row in Table 1. In Figure 2c, the differences between the original sampler (blue) and our reimplementation (orange) are explained by this choice. 2. In the context of our time step discretization (Eq. 5), we must ensure that σi ∈ {uj}. We accomplish this by rounding each σi to its nearest supported counterpart, i.e., σi ← uarg minj|uj−σi|, and setting σmin = 0.0064 ≈ uN−1. This is sufﬁcient, because Algo- rithm 1 only evaluates Dθ(·; σ) with σ∈{σi<N}. 3. In the context of our stochastic sampler, we must ensure that ˆti ∈{uj}. We accomplish this by replacing line 5 of Algorithm 2 with ˆti ←uarg minj|uj−(ti+γiti)|. With these changes, we are able to import the pre-trained model directly asFθ(·) and run Algorithms 1 and 2 using the deﬁnitions in Table 1. Note that the model outputs both ϵθ(·) and Σθ(·), as described in Section 3.1 of [37]; we use only the former and ignore the latter. D Further analysis of deterministic sampling D.1 Truncation error analysis and choice of discretization parameters As discussed in Section 3, the fundamental reason why diffusion models tend to require a large number of sampling steps is that any numerical ODE solver is necessarily an approximation; the 17https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/diffusion/jul-2021/64x64_diffusion.pt 38σ=0.02 0.1 0.5 1 2 5 1020 5010-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101 102 ∥τ∥ ρ= 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 7.0 σ=0.02 0.1 0.5 1 2 5 1020 5010-4 10-3 10-2 10-1 100 101 102 ∥τ∥ ρ= 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 7.0 ρ=1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 4 5 6 7 8910FID CIFAR-10, VP,N= 32CIFAR-10, VE,N= 64ImageNet-64,N= 12 (a) Truncation error, VE + Euler (b) Truncation error, VE + Heun (c) FID as a function of ρ Figure 13: (a) Local truncation error (y-axis) at different noise levels (x-axis) using Euler’s method with the VE-based CIFAR-10 model. Each curve corresponds to a different time step discretization, deﬁned for N = 64 and a speciﬁc choice for the polynomial exponent ρ. The values represent the root mean square error (RMSE) between one Euler iteration and a sequence of multiple smaller Euler iterations, representing the ground truth. The shaded regions, barely visible at low σ, represent standard deviation over different latents x0. (b) Corresponding error curves for Heun’s 2nd order method (Algorithm 1). (c) FID (y-axis) as a function of the polynomial exponent (x-axis) for different models, measured using Heun’s 2nd order method. The shaded regions indicate the range of variation between the lowest and highest observed FID, and the dots indicate the value of ρthat we use in all other experiments. larger the steps, the farther away we drift from the true solution at each step. Speciﬁcally, given the value of xi−1 at time step i−1, the solver approximates the true x∗ i as xi, resulting in local truncation error τi = x∗ i −xi. The local errors get accumulated over the N steps, ultimately leading to global truncation error eN. Euler’s method is a ﬁrst order ODE solver, meaning thatτi = O ( h2 i ) for any sufﬁciently smooth x(t), where hi = |ti −ti−1|is the local step size [50]. In other words, there exist some C and H such that ||τi||< Ch2 i for every hi < H, i.e., halving hi reduces τi by 4×. Furthermore, if we assume that Dθ is Lipschitz continuous — which is true for all network architectures considered in this paper — the global truncation error is bounded by ||eN||≤ Emaxi||τi||, where the value of E depends on N, t0, tN, and the Lipschitz constant [ 50]. Thus, reducing the global error for given N, which in turn enables reducing N itself, boils down to choosing the solver and {ti}so that maxi||τi||is minimized. To gain insight on how the local truncation error behaves in practice, we measure the values of τi over different noise levels using the VE-based CIFAR-10 model. For a given noise level, we set ti = σ−1(σi) and choose some ti−1 > ti depending on the case. We then sample xi−1 from p(x; σi−1) and estimate the true x∗ i by performing 200 Euler steps over uniformly selected subintervals between ti−1 and t. Finally, we plot the mean and standard deviation of the root mean square error (RMSE), i.e., ||τi||/ √ dim τ, as a function of σi, averaged over 200 random samples of xi−1. Results for Euler’s method are shown in Figure 13a, where the blue curve corresponds to uniform step size hσ = 1.25 with respect to σ, i.e., σi−1 = σi + hσ and ti−1 = σ−1(σi−1). We see that the error is very large (RMSE ≈0.56) for low noise levels (σi ≤0.5) and considerably smaller for high noise levels. This is in line with the common intuition that, in order to reduce eN, the step size should be decreased monotonically with decreasing σ. Each curve is surrounded by a shaded region that indicates standard deviation, barely visible at low values ofσ. This indicates that τi is nearly constant with respect to xi−1, and thus there would be no beneﬁt in varying {ti}schedule on a per-sample basis. A convenient way to vary the local step size depending on the noise level is to deﬁne {σi}as a linear resampling of some monotonically increasing, unbounded warp function w(z). In other words, σi<N = w(Ai+ B) and σN = 0, where constants Aand B are selected so that σ0 = σmax and σN−1 = σmin. In practice, we set σmin = max(σlo,0.002) and σmax = min(σhi,80), where σlo and σhi are the lowest and highest noise levels supported by a given model, respectively; we have found these choices to perform reasonably well in practice. Now, to balance τi between low and high noise levels, we can, for example, use a polynomial warp function w(z) = zρ parameterized by the 39exponent ρ. This choice leads to the following formula for {σi}: σi<N = ( σmax 1 ρ + i N −1 ( σmin 1 ρ −σmax 1 ρ ))ρ ,σN = 0, (269) which reduces to uniform discretization when ρ= 1 and gives more and more emphasis to low noise levels as ρincreases.18 Based on the value of σi, we can now compute σi−1 = ( σ1/ρ i −A )ρ , which enables us to visualize τi for different choices of ρin Figure 13a. We see that increasing ρreduces the error for low noise levels (σ <10) while increasing it for high noise levels (σ >10). Approximate balance is achieved at ρ= 2, but RMSE remains relatively high (∼0.03), meaning that Euler’s method drifts away from the correct result by several ULPs at each step. While the error could be reduced by increasing N, we would ideally like the RMSE to be well below 0.01 even with low step counts. Heun’s method introduces an additional correction step forxi+1 to account for the fact that dx/dt may change between ti and ti+1; Euler’s method assumes it to be constant. The correction leads to cubic convergence of the local truncation error, i.e., τi = O ( h3 i ) , at the cost of one additional evaluation of Dθ per step. We discuss the general family of Heun-like schemes later in Appendix D.2. Figure 13b shows local truncation error for Heun’s method using the same setup as Figure 13a. We see that the differences in ||τi||are generally more pronounced, which is to be expected given the quadratic vs. cubic convergence of the two methods. Cases where Euler’s method has low RMSE tend to have even lower RMSE with Heun’s method, and vice versa for cases with high RMSE. Most remarkably, the red curve shows almost constant RMSE ∈[0.0030,0.0045]. This means that the combination of Eq. 269 and Heun’s method is, in fact, very close to optimal withρ= 3. Thus far, we have only considered the raw numerical error, i.e., component-wise deviation from the true result in RGB space. The raw numerical error is relevant for certain use cases, e.g., image manipulation where the ODE is ﬁrst evaluated in the direction of increasing tand then back to t= 0 again — in this case, ||eN||directly tells us how much the original image degrades in the process and we can use ρ = 3 to minimize it. Considering the generation of novel images from scratch, however, it is reasonable to expect different noise levels to introduce different kinds of errors that may not necessarily be on equal footing considering their perceptual importance. We investigate this in Figure 13c, where we plot FID as a function of ρfor different models and different choices of N. Note that the ImageNet-64 model was only trained for a discrete set of noise levels; in order to use it with Eq. 269, we round each ti to its nearest supported counterpart, i.e., t′ i = uarg minj|uj−ti|. From the plot, we can see that even though ρ = 3 leads to relatively good FID, it can be reduced further by choosing ρ> 3. This corresponds to intentionally introducing error at high noise levels to reduce it at low noise levels, which makes intuitive sense because the value ofσmax is somewhat arbitrary to begin with — increasing σmax can have a large impact on ||eN||, but it does not affect the resulting image distribution nearly as much. In general, we have found ρ= 7 to perform reasonably well in all cases, and use this value in all other experiments. D.2 General family of 2 nd order Runge–Kutta variants Heun’s method illustrated in Algorithm 1 belongs to a family of explicit two-stage 2nd order Runge– Kutta methods, each having the same computational cost. A common parameterization [50] of this family is, di = f(xi; ti) ; xi+1 = xi + h [( 1 − 1 2α ) di + 1 2αf(xi + αhdi; ti + αh) ] , (270) where h= ti+1 −ti and αis a parameter that controls where the additional gradient is evaluated and how much it inﬂuences the step taken. Setting α= 1 corresponds to Heun’s method, andα= 1 2 and α= 2 3 yield so-called midpoint and Ralston methods, respectively. All these variants differ in the kind of approximation error they incur due to the geometry of the underlying function f. To establish the optimal αin our use case, we ran a separate series of experiments. According to the results, it appears that α = 1 is very close to being optimal. Nonetheless, the experimentally 18In the limit, Eq. 269 reduces to the same geometric sequence employed by original VE ODE when ρ→∞. Thus, our discretization can be seen as a parametric generalization of the one proposed by Song et al. [49]. 40Algorithm 3 Deterministic sampling using general 2nd order Runge–Kutta, σ(t) = tand s(t) = 1. 1: procedure ALPHA SAMPLER (Dθ(x; σ), ti∈{0,...,N}, α) 2: sample x0 ∼N ( 0, t2 0 I ) 3: for i∈{0,...,N −1}do 4: hi ←ti+1 −ti ⊿Step length 5: di ← ( xi −Dθ(xi; ti) ) /ti ⊿Evaluate dx/dtat (x, ti) 6: (x′ i, t′ i) ←(xi + αhdi, ti + αh) ⊿Additional evaluation point 7: if t′ i ̸= 0 then 8: d′ i ← ( x′ i −Dθ(x′ i; t′ i) ) /t′ i ⊿Evaluate dx/dtat (x′ i, t′ i) 9: xi+1 ←xi + h [( 1 − 1 2α ) di + 1 2αd′ i ] ⊿Second order step from ti to ti+1 10: else 11: xi+1 ←xi + hdi ⊿Euler step from ti to ti+1 12: return xN best choice was α = 1.1 that performed slightly better, even though values greater than one are theoretically hard to justify as they overshoot the target ti+1. As we have no good explanation for this observation and cannot tell if it holds in general, we chose not to make αa new hyperparameter and instead ﬁxed it to 1, corresponding exactly to Heun’s method. Further analysis is left as future work, including the possibility of having αvary during sampling. An additional beneﬁt of setting α= 1 is that it makes it possible to use pre-trained neural networks Dθ(x; σ) that have been trained only for speciﬁc values of σ. This is because a Heun step evaluates the additional gradient at exactly ti+1 unlike the other 2nd order variants. Hence it is sufﬁcient to ensure that each ti corresponds to a value of σthat the network was trained for. Algorithm 3 shows the pseudocode for a general 2nd order solver parameterized by α. For clarity, the pseudocode assumes the speciﬁc choices of σ(t) = tand s(t) = 1 that we advocate in Section 3. Note that the fallback to Euler step (line 11) can occur only when α≥1. E Further results with stochastic sampling E.1 Image degradation due to excessive stochastic iteration Figure 14 illustrates the image degradation caused by excessive Langevin iteration (Section 4, “Practical considerations”). These images are generated by doing a speciﬁed number of iterations at a ﬁxed noise level σso that at each iteration an equal amount of noise is added and removed. In theory, Langevin dynamics should bring the distribution towards the ideal distribution p(x; σ) but as noted in Section 4, this holds only if the denoiser Dθ(x; σ) induces a conservative vector ﬁeld in Eq. 3. As seen in the ﬁgure, it is clear that the image distribution suffers from repeated iteration in all cases, although the exact failure mode depends on dataset and noise level. For low noise levels (below 0.2 or so), the images tend to oversaturate starting at 2k iterations and become fully corrupted after that. Our heuristic of setting Stmin >0 is designed to prevent stochastic sampling altogether at very low noise levels to avoid this effect. For high noise levels, we can see that iterating without the standard deviation correction, i.e., when Snoise = 1.000, the images tend to become more abstract and devoid of color at high iteration counts; this is especially visible in the 10k column of CIFAR-10 where the images become mostly black and white with no discernible backgrounds. Our heuristic inﬂation of standard deviation by setting Snoise >1 counteracts this tendency efﬁciently, as seen in the corresponding images on the right hand side of the ﬁgure. Notably, this still does not ﬁx the oversaturation and corruption at low noise levels, suggesting multiple sources for the detrimental effects of excessive iteration. Further research will be required to better understand the root causes of these observed effects. Figure 15 presents the output quality of our stochastic sampler in terms of FID as a function of Schurn at ﬁxed NFE, using pre-trained networks of Song et al. [49] and Dhariwal and Nichol [9]. Generally, for each case and combination of our heuristic corrections, there is an optimal amount of stochasticity after which the results start to degrade. It can also be seen that regardless of the value of Schurn, the 41Uncond. CIFAR-10, Pre-trained, VP,Snoise = 1.000 Uncond.

These were determined with a grid search over the combinations listed in the rightmost column. It can be seen that the optimal parameters depend on the case; better understanding of the degradation phenomena will hopefully give rise to more direct ways of handling the problem in the future. F Implementation details We implemented our techniques in a newly written codebase, based loosely on the original imple- mentations by Song et al.19 [49], Dhariwal and Nichol20 [9], and Karras et al.21 [26]. We performed extensive testing to verify that our implementation produced exactly the same results as previous work, including samplers, pre-trained models, network architectures, training conﬁgurations, and evaluation. We ran all experiments using PyTorch 1.10.0, CUDA 11.4, and CuDNN 8.2.0 on NVIDIA DGX-1’s with 8 Tesla V100 GPUs each. Our implementation and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/edm 19https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde_pytorch 20https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion 21https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3 43Table 6: Our augmentation pipeline. Each training image undergoes a combined geometric transfor- mation based on 8 random parameters that receive non-zero values with a certain probability. The model is conditioned with an additional 9-dimensional input vector derived from these parameters. Augmentation Transformation Parameters Prob.

We use the pre-trained Inception-v3 model provided with StyleGAN322 [26] that is, in turn, a direct PyTorch translation of the original TensorFlow-based model 23. We have veriﬁed that our FID implementation produces identical results compared to Dhariwal and Nichol [9] and Karras et al. [ 26]. To reduce the impact of random variation, typically in the order of ±2%, we compute FID three times in each experiment and report the minimum. We also highlight the difference between the highest and lowest achieved FID in Figures 4, 5b, 13c, and 15. F.2 Augmentation regularization In Section 5, we propose to combat overﬁtting of Dθ using conditional augmentation. We build our augmentation pipeline around the same concepts that were originally proposed by Karras et al. [25] in the context of GANs. In practice, we employ a set of 6 geometric transformations; we have found other types of augmentations, such as color corruption and image-space ﬁltering, to be consistently harmful for diffusion-based models. The details of our augmentation pipeline are shown in Table 6. We apply the augmentations indepen- dently to each training image y∼pdata prior to adding the noise n∼N(0,σ2I). First, we determine whether to enable or disable each augmentation based on a weighted coin toss. The probability of enabling a given augmentation (“Prob.” column) is ﬁxed to 12% for CIFAR-10 and 15% for FFHQ and AFHQv2, except for x-ﬂips that are always enabled. We then draw 8 random parameters from their corresponding distributions (“Parameters” column); if a given augmentation is disabled, we override the associated parameters with zero. Based on these, we construct a homogeneous 2D transformation matrix based on the parameters (“Transformation” column). This transformation is applied to the image using the implementation of [25] that employs 2×supersampled high-quality Wavelet ﬁlters. Finally, we construct a 9-dimensional conditioning input vector (“Conditioning” column) and feed it to the denoiser network, in addition to the image and noise level inputs. The role of the conditioning input is to present the network with a set of auxiliary tasks; in addition to the main task of modeling p(x; σ), we effectively ask the network to also model an inﬁnite set of distributions p(x; σ,a) for each possible choice of the augmentation parameters a. These auxiliary tasks provide the network with a large variety of unique training samples, preventing it from 22https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/research/stylegan3/versions/1/files/metrics/inception-2015-12-05.pkl 23http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz 44Table 7: Hyperparameters used for the training runs in Section 5.

Still, the auxiliary tasks appear to be beneﬁcial for the main task; we speculate that this is because the denoising operation itself is similar for every choice of a. We have designed the conditioning input so that zero corresponds to the case where no augmentations were applied. During sampling, we simply set a = 0 to obtain results consistent with the main task. We have not observed any leakage between the auxiliary tasks and the main task; the generated images exhibit no traces of out-of-domain geometric transformations even with Aprob = 100%. In practice, this means that we are free to choose the constants {Aprob,Ascale,Aaniso,Atrans}any way we like as long as the results improve. Horizontal ﬂips serve as an interesting example. Most of the prior work augments the training set with random x-ﬂips, which is beneﬁcial for most datasets but has the downside that any text or logos may appear mirrored in the generated images. With our non-leaky augmentations, we get the same beneﬁts without the downsides by executing the x-ﬂip augmentation with 100% probability. Thus, we rely exclusively on our augmentation scheme and disable dataset x-ﬂips to ensure that the generated images stay true to the original distribution. F.3 Training conﬁgurations Table 7 shows the exact set of hyperparameters that we used in our training experiments reported in Section 5. We will ﬁrst detail the conﬁgurations used with CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and AFHQv2, and then discuss the training of our improved ImageNet model. Conﬁg A of Table 2 (“Baseline”) corresponds to the original setup of Song et al. [49] for the two cases (VP and VE), and conﬁg F (“Ours”) corresponds to our improved setup. We trained each model until a total of 200 million images had been drawn from the training set, abbreviated as “200 Mimg” in Table 7; this corresponds to a total of∼400,000 training iterations using a batch size of 512. We saved a snapshot of the model every 2.5 million images and reported results for the snapshot that achieved the lowest FID according to our deterministic sampler with NFE= 35 or NFE = 79, depending on the resolution. In conﬁg B, we re-adjust the basic hyperparameters to enable faster training and obtain a more meaningful point of comparison. Speciﬁcally, we increase the parallelism from 4 to 8 GPUs and batch size from 128 to 512 or 256, depending on the resolution. We also disable gradient clipping, i.e., forcing ∥dL(Dθ)/dθ∥2 ≤1, that we found to provide no beneﬁt in practice. Furthermore, we increase the learning rate from 0.0002 to 0.001 for CIFAR-10, ramping it up during the ﬁrst 10 million images, and standardize the half-life of the exponential moving average of θto 0.5 million images. Finally, we adjust the dropout probability for each dataset as shown in Table 7 via a full grid search at 1% increments. Our total training time is approximately 2 days for CIFAR-10 at 32×32 resolution and 4 days for FFHQ and AFHQv2 at 64×64 resolution. 45Table 8: Details of the network architectures used in this paper.

The original models of Song et al. [49] employ 128 channels at 64×64 (where applicable) and 32×32, and 256 channels at 16×16, 8×8, and 4×4. We change these numbers to 128 channels at 64×64 (where applicable), and 256 channels at 32×32, 16×16, and 8×8. We abbreviate these counts in Table 7 as multiples of 128, listed from the highest resolution to the lowest. In practice, this rebalancing reduces the total number of trainable parameters slightly, resulting in ∼56 million parameters for each model at 32×32 resolution and ∼62 million parameters at 64×64 resolution. In conﬁg D, we replace the original preconditioning with our improved formulas (“Network and preconditioning” section in Table 1). In conﬁg E, we do the same for the noise distribution and loss weighting (“Training” section in Table 1). Finally, in conﬁgF, we enable augmentation regularization as discussed in Appendix F.2. The other hyperparameters remain the same as in conﬁg C. With ImageNet-64, it is necessary to train considerably longer compared to the other datasets in order to reach state-of-the-art results. To reduce the training time, we employed 32 NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (4 nodes) with a batch size of 4096 (128 per GPU) and utilized the high-performance Tensor Cores via mixed-precision FP16/FP32 training. In practice, we store the trainable parameters as FP32 but cast them to FP16 when evaluating Fθ, except for the embedding and self-attention layers, where we found the limited exponent range of FP16 to occasionally lead to stability issues. We trained the model for two weeks, corresponding to ∼2500 million images drawn from the training set and ∼600,000 training iterations, using learning rate 0.0001, exponential moving average of 50 million images, and the same model architecture and dropout probability as Dhariwal and Nichol [9]. We did not ﬁnd overﬁtting to be a concern, and thus chose to not employ augmentation regularization. F.4 Network architectures As a result of our training improvements, the VP and VE cases become otherwise identical in con- ﬁg F except for the network architecture; VP employs the DDPM++ architecture while VE employs NCSN++, both of which were originally proposed by Song et al. [ 49]. These architectures corre- spond to relatively straightforward variations of the same U-net backbone with three differences, as illustrated in Table 8. First, DDPM++ employs box ﬁlter [1,1] for the upsampling and downsampling layers whereas NCSN++ employs bilinear ﬁlter [1,3,3,1]. Second, DDPM++ inherits its positional encoding scheme for the noise level directly from DDPM [ 16] whereas NCSN++ replaces it with random Fourier features [ 52]. Third, NCSN ++ incorporates additional residual skip connections from the input image to each block in the encoder, as explained in Appendix H of [49] (“progressive growing architectures”). For class conditioning and augmentation regularization, we extend the original DDPM ++ and NCSN++ arhictectures by introducing two optional conditioning inputs alongside the noise level input. We represent class labels as one-hot encoded vectors that we ﬁrst scale by √ C, where C is the total number of classes, and then feed through a fully-connected layer. For the augmentation parameters, we feed the conditioning inputs of Appendix F.2 through a fully-connected layer as-is. 46We then combine the resulting feature vectors with the original noise level conditioning vector through elementwise addition. For class-conditional ImageNet-64, we use the ADM architecture of Dhariwal and Nichol [9] with no changes. The model has a total of ∼296 million trainable parameters. As detailed in Tables 7 and 8, the most notable differences to DDPM ++ include the use of a slightly shallower model (3 residual blocks per resolution instead of 4) with considerably more channels (e.g., 768 in the lowest resolution instead of 256), more self-attention layers interspersed throughout the network (22 instead of 6), and the use of multi-head attention (e.g., 12 heads in the lowest resolution). We feel that the precise impact of architectural choices remains an interesting question for future work.

Introduction Image synthesis is one of the computer vision ﬁelds with the most spectacular recent development, but also among those with the greatest computational demands. Espe- cially high-resolution synthesis of complex, natural scenes is presently dominated by scaling up likelihood-based mod- els, potentially containing billions of parameters in autore- gressive (AR) transformers [66,67]. In contrast, the promis- ing results of GANs [3, 27, 40] have been revealed to be mostly conﬁned to data with comparably limited variability as their adversarial learning procedure does not easily scale to modeling complex, multi-modal distributions. Recently, diffusion models [82], which are built from a hierarchy of denoising autoencoders, have shown to achieve impressive *The ﬁrst two authors contributed equally to this work.

[12]; see also Tab. 8. results in image synthesis [30,85] and beyond [7,45,48,57], and deﬁne the state-of-the-art in class-conditional image synthesis [15,31] and super-resolution [72]. Moreover, even unconditional DMs can readily be applied to tasks such as inpainting and colorization [85] or stroke-based syn- thesis [53], in contrast to other types of generative mod- els [19, 46, 69]. Being likelihood-based models, they do not exhibit mode-collapse and training instabilities as GANs and, by heavily exploiting parameter sharing, they can model highly complex distributions of natural images with- out involving billions of parameters as in AR models [67]. Democratizing High-Resolution Image Synthesis DMs belong to the class of likelihood-based models, whose mode-covering behavior makes them prone to spend ex- cessive amounts of capacity (and thus compute resources) on modeling imperceptible details of the data [16, 73]. Al- though the reweighted variational objective [30] aims to ad- dress this by undersampling the initial denoising steps, DMs are still computationally demanding, since training and evaluating such a model requires repeated function evalu- ations (and gradient computations) in the high-dimensional space of RGB images. As an example, training the most powerful DMs often takes hundreds of GPU days (e.g. 150 - 1000 V100 days in [15]) and repeated evaluations on a noisy version of the input space render also inference expensive, 1 arXiv:2112.10752v2  [cs.CV]  13 Apr 2022so that producing 50k samples takes approximately 5 days [15] on a single A100 GPU. This has two consequences for the research community and users in general: Firstly, train- ing such a model requires massive computational resources only available to a small fraction of the ﬁeld, and leaves a huge carbon footprint [65, 86]. Secondly, evaluating an al- ready trained model is also expensive in time and memory, since the same model architecture must run sequentially for a large number of steps (e.g. 25 - 1000 steps in [15]). To increase the accessibility of this powerful model class and at the same time reduce its signiﬁcant resource con- sumption, a method is needed that reduces the computa- tional complexity for both training and sampling. Reducing the computational demands of DMs without impairing their performance is, therefore, key to enhance their accessibility. Departure to Latent Space Our approach starts with the analysis of already trained diffusion models in pixel space: Fig. 2 shows the rate-distortion trade-off of a trained model. As with any likelihood-based model, learning can be roughly divided into two stages: First is a perceptual compression stage which removes high-frequency details but still learns little semantic variation. In the second stage, the actual generative model learns the semantic and concep- tual composition of the data ( semantic compression). We thus aim to ﬁrst ﬁnd a perceptually equivalent, but compu- tationally more suitable space, in which we will train diffu- sion models for high-resolution image synthesis. Following common practice [11, 23, 66, 67, 96], we sep- arate training into two distinct phases: First, we train an autoencoder which provides a lower-dimensional (and thereby efﬁcient) representational space which is perceptu- ally equivalent to the data space. Importantly, and in con- trast to previous work [23,66], we do not need to rely on ex- cessive spatial compression, as we train DMs in the learned latent space, which exhibits better scaling properties with respect to the spatial dimensionality. The reduced complex- ity also provides efﬁcient image generation from the latent space with a single network pass. We dub the resulting model class Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). A notable advantage of this approach is that we need to train the universal autoencoding stage only once and can therefore reuse it for multiple DM trainings or to explore possibly completely different tasks [81]. This enables efﬁ- cient exploration of a large number of diffusion models for various image-to-image and text-to-image tasks. For the lat- ter, we design an architecture that connects transformers to the DM’s UNet backbone [71] and enables arbitrary types of token-based conditioning mechanisms, see Sec. 3.3. In sum, our work makes the following contributions: (i) In contrast to purely transformer-based approaches [23, 66], our method scales more graceful to higher dimen- sional data and can thus (a) work on a compression level which provides more faithful and detailed reconstructions than previous work (see Fig. 1) and (b) can be efﬁciently Figure 2. Illustrating perceptual and semantic compression: Most bits of a digital image correspond to imperceptible details. While DMs allow to suppress this semantically meaningless information by minimizing the responsible loss term, gradients (during train- ing) and the neural network backbone (training and inference) still need to be evaluated on all pixels, leading to superﬂuous compu- tations and unnecessarily expensive optimization and inference. We propose latent diffusion models (LDMs) as an effective gener- ative model and a separate mild compression stage that only elim- inates imperceptible details. Data and images from [30]. applied to high-resolution synthesis of megapixel images. (ii) We achieve competitive performance on multiple tasks (unconditional image synthesis, inpainting, stochastic super-resolution) and datasets while signiﬁcantly lowering computational costs. Compared to pixel-based diffusion ap- proaches, we also signiﬁcantly decrease inference costs. (iii) We show that, in contrast to previous work [93] which learns both an encoder/decoder architecture and a score-based prior simultaneously, our approach does not re- quire a delicate weighting of reconstruction and generative abilities. This ensures extremely faithful reconstructions and requires very little regularization of the latent space. (iv) We ﬁnd that for densely conditioned tasks such as super-resolution, inpainting and semantic synthesis, our model can be applied in a convolutional fashion and render large, consistent images of ∼10242 px. (v) Moreover, we design a general-purpose conditioning mechanism based on cross-attention, enabling multi-modal training. We use it to train class-conditional, text-to-image and layout-to-image models. (vi) Finally, we release pretrained latent diffusion and autoencoding models at https : / / github . com/CompVis/latent-diffusion which might be reusable for a various tasks besides training of DMs [81]. 2. Related Work Generative Models for Image Synthesis The high di- mensional nature of images presents distinct challenges to generative modeling. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [27] allow for efﬁcient sampling of high resolution images with good perceptual quality [3, 42], but are difﬁ- 2cult to optimize [2, 28, 54] and struggle to capture the full data distribution [55]. In contrast, likelihood-based meth- ods emphasize good density estimation which renders op- timization more well-behaved. Variational autoencoders (V AE) [46] and ﬂow-based models [18, 19] enable efﬁcient synthesis of high resolution images [9, 44, 92], but sam- ple quality is not on par with GANs. While autoregressive models (ARM) [6, 10, 94, 95] achieve strong performance in density estimation, computationally demanding architec- tures [97] and a sequential sampling process limit them to low resolution images. Because pixel based representations of images contain barely perceptible, high-frequency de- tails [16,73], maximum-likelihood training spends a dispro- portionate amount of capacity on modeling them, resulting in long training times. To scale to higher resolutions, several two-stage approaches [23,67,101,103] use ARMs to model a compressed latent image space instead of raw pixels. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DM) [82], have achieved state-of-the-art results in density estimation [45] as well as in sample quality [15]. The generative power of these models stems from a natural ﬁt to the inductive bi- ases of image-like data when their underlying neural back- bone is implemented as a UNet [15, 30, 71, 85]. The best synthesis quality is usually achieved when a reweighted ob- jective [30] is used for training. In this case, the DM corre- sponds to a lossy compressor and allow to trade image qual- ity for compression capabilities. Evaluating and optimizing these models in pixel space, however, has the downside of low inference speed and very high training costs. While the former can be partially adressed by advanced sampling strategies [47, 75, 84] and hierarchical approaches [31, 93], training on high-resolution image data always requires to calculate expensive gradients. We adress both drawbacks with our proposed LDMs, which work on a compressed la- tent space of lower dimensionality. This renders training computationally cheaper and speeds up inference with al- most no reduction in synthesis quality (see Fig. 1). Two-Stage Image Synthesis To mitigate the shortcom- ings of individual generative approaches, a lot of research [11, 23, 67, 70, 101, 103] has gone into combining the strengths of different methods into more efﬁcient and per- formant models via a two stage approach. VQ-V AEs [67, 101] use autoregressive models to learn an expressive prior over a discretized latent space. [66] extend this approach to text-to-image generation by learning a joint distributation over discretized image and text representations. More gen- erally, [70] uses conditionally invertible networks to pro- vide a generic transfer between latent spaces of diverse do- mains. Different from VQ-V AEs, VQGANs [23, 103] em- ploy a ﬁrst stage with an adversarial and perceptual objec- tive to scale autoregressive transformers to larger images. However, the high compression rates required for feasible ARM training, which introduces billions of trainable pa- rameters [23, 66], limit the overall performance of such ap- proaches and less compression comes at the price of high computational cost [23, 66]. Our work prevents such trade- offs, as our proposed LDMs scale more gently to higher dimensional latent spaces due to their convolutional back- bone. Thus, we are free to choose the level of compression which optimally mediates between learning a powerful ﬁrst stage, without leaving too much perceptual compression up to the generative diffusion model while guaranteeing high- ﬁdelity reconstructions (see Fig. 1). While approaches to jointly [93] or separately [80] learn an encoding/decoding model together with a score-based prior exist, the former still require a difﬁcult weighting be- tween reconstruction and generative capabilities [11] and are outperformed by our approach (Sec. 4), and the latter focus on highly structured images such as human faces. 3. Method To lower the computational demands of training diffu- sion models towards high-resolution image synthesis, we observe that although diffusion models allow to ignore perceptually irrelevant details by undersampling the corre- sponding loss terms [30], they still require costly function evaluations in pixel space, which causes huge demands in computation time and energy resources. We propose to circumvent this drawback by introducing an explicit separation of the compressive from the genera- tive learning phase (see Fig. 2). To achieve this, we utilize an autoencoding model which learns a space that is percep- tually equivalent to the image space, but offers signiﬁcantly reduced computational complexity. Such an approach offers several advantages: (i) By leav- ing the high-dimensional image space, we obtain DMs which are computationally much more efﬁcient because sampling is performed on a low-dimensional space. (ii) We exploit the inductive bias of DMs inherited from their UNet architecture [71], which makes them particularly effective for data with spatial structure and therefore alleviates the need for aggressive, quality-reducing compression levels as required by previous approaches [23, 66]. (iii) Finally, we obtain general-purpose compression models whose latent space can be used to train multiple generative models and which can also be utilized for other downstream applica- tions such as single-image CLIP-guided synthesis [25]. 3.1. Perceptual Image Compression Our perceptual compression model is based on previous work [23] and consists of an autoencoder trained by com- bination of a perceptual loss [106] and a patch-based [33] adversarial objective [20, 23, 103]. This ensures that the re- constructions are conﬁned to the image manifold by enforc- ing local realism and avoids bluriness introduced by relying solely on pixel-space losses such as L2 or L1 objectives. More precisely, given an image x ∈RH×W×3 in RGB space, the encoder E encodes x into a latent representa- 3tion z = E(x), and the decoder Dreconstructs the im- age from the latent, giving ˜x = D(z) = D(E(x)), where z ∈Rh×w×c. Importantly, the encoder downsamples the image by a factor f = H/h = W/w, and we investigate different downsampling factors f = 2m, with m∈N. In order to avoid arbitrarily high-variance latent spaces, we experiment with two different kinds of regularizations. The ﬁrst variant, KL-reg., imposes a slight KL-penalty to- wards a standard normal on the learned latent, similar to a V AE [46, 69], whereasVQ-reg. uses a vector quantization layer [96] within the decoder. This model can be interpreted as a VQGAN [23] but with the quantization layer absorbed by the decoder. Because our subsequent DM is designed to work with the two-dimensional structure of our learned latent space z = E(x), we can use relatively mild compres- sion rates and achieve very good reconstructions. This is in contrast to previous works [23, 66], which relied on an arbitrary 1D ordering of the learned space z to model its distribution autoregressively and thereby ignored much of the inherent structure of z. Hence, our compression model preserves details of xbetter (see Tab. 8). The full objective and training details can be found in the supplement. 3.2. Latent Diffusion Models Diffusion Models [82] are probabilistic models designed to learn a data distribution p(x) by gradually denoising a nor- mally distributed variable, which corresponds to learning the reverse process of a ﬁxed Markov Chain of length T. For image synthesis, the most successful models [15,30,72] rely on a reweighted variant of the variational lower bound on p(x), which mirrors denoising score-matching [85]. These models can be interpreted as an equally weighted sequence of denoising autoencoders ϵθ(xt,t); t = 1...T , which are trained to predict a denoised variant of their input xt, where xt is a noisy version of the input x. The corre- sponding objective can be simpliﬁed to (Sec. B) LDM = Ex,ϵ∼N(0,1),t [ ∥ϵ−ϵθ(xt,t)∥2 2 ] , (1) with tuniformly sampled from {1,...,T }. Generative Modeling of Latent Representations With our trained perceptual compression models consisting of E and D, we now have access to an efﬁcient, low-dimensional latent space in which high-frequency, imperceptible details are abstracted away. Compared to the high-dimensional pixel space, this space is more suitable for likelihood-based generative models, as they can now (i) focus on the impor- tant, semantic bits of the data and (ii) train in a lower di- mensional, computationally much more efﬁcient space. Unlike previous work that relied on autoregressive, attention-based transformer models in a highly compressed, discrete latent space [23,66,103], we can take advantage of image-speciﬁc inductive biases that our model offers. This Semantic   Map crossattention Latent Space Conditioning  Text Diffusion Process denoising step switch skip connection Repres  entations Pixel Space Images Denoising U-Net concat Figure 3. We condition LDMs either via concatenation or by a more general cross-attention mechanism. See Sec. 3.3 includes the ability to build the underlying UNet primar- ily from 2D convolutional layers, and further focusing the objective on the perceptually most relevant bits using the reweighted bound, which now reads LLDM := EE(x),ϵ∼N(0,1),t [ ∥ϵ−ϵθ(zt,t)∥2 2 ] . (2) The neural backbone ϵθ(◦,t) of our model is realized as a time-conditional UNet [71]. Since the forward process is ﬁxed, zt can be efﬁciently obtained from Eduring training, and samples from p(z) can be decoded to image space with a single pass through D. 3.3. Conditioning Mechanisms Similar to other types of generative models [56, 83], diffusion models are in principle capable of modeling conditional distributions of the form p(z|y). This can be implemented with a conditional denoising autoencoder ϵθ(zt,t,y ) and paves the way to controlling the synthesis process through inputs y such as text [68], semantic maps [33, 61] or other image-to-image translation tasks [34]. In the context of image synthesis, however, combining the generative power of DMs with other types of condition- ings beyond class-labels [15] or blurred variants of the input image [72] is so far an under-explored area of research. We turn DMs into more ﬂexible conditional image gener- ators by augmenting their underlying UNet backbone with the cross-attention mechanism [97], which is effective for learning attention-based models of various input modali- ties [35,36]. To pre-process yfrom various modalities (such as language prompts) we introduce a domain speciﬁc en- coder τθ that projects y to an intermediate representation τθ(y) ∈RM×dτ, which is then mapped to the intermediate layers of the UNet via a cross-attention layer implementing Attention(Q,K,V ) =softmax ( QKT √ d ) ·V, with Q= W(i) Q ·ϕi(zt), K= W(i) K ·τθ(y), V= W(i) V ·τθ(y).

For more samples cf . the supplement. Rd×di ϵ, W(i) Q ∈Rd×dτ & W(i) K ∈Rd×dτ are learnable pro- jection matrices [36, 97]. See Fig. 3 for a visual depiction. Based on image-conditioning pairs, we then learn the conditional LDM via LLDM := EE(x),y,ϵ∼N(0,1),t [ ∥ϵ−ϵθ(zt,t,τ θ(y))∥2 2 ] , (3) where both τθ and ϵθ are jointly optimized via Eq. 3. This conditioning mechanism is ﬂexible as τθ can be parameter- ized with domain-speciﬁc experts, e.g. (unmasked) trans- formers [97] when yare text prompts (see Sec. 4.3.1) 4. Experiments LDMs provide means to ﬂexible and computationally tractable diffusion based image synthesis of various image modalities, which we empirically show in the following. Firstly, however, we analyze the gains of our models com- pared to pixel-based diffusion models in both training and inference. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that LDMs trained in VQ- regularized latent spaces sometimes achieve better sample quality, even though the reconstruction capabilities of VQ- regularized ﬁrst stage models slightly fall behind those of their continuous counterparts, cf . Tab. 8. A visual compari- son between the effects of ﬁrst stage regularization schemes on LDM training and their generalization abilities to resolu- tions >2562 can be found in Appendix D.1. In E.2 we list details on architecture, implementation, training and evalu- ation for all results presented in this section. 4.1. On Perceptual Compression Tradeoffs This section analyzes the behavior of our LDMs with dif- ferent downsampling factorsf ∈{1,2,4,8,16,32}(abbre- viated as LDM-f, where LDM-1 corresponds to pixel-based DMs). To obtain a comparable test-ﬁeld, we ﬁx the com- putational resources to a single NVIDIA A100 for all ex- periments in this section and train all models for the same number of steps and with the same number of parameters. Tab. 8 shows hyperparameters and reconstruction perfor- mance of the ﬁrst stage models used for the LDMs com- pared in this section. Fig. 6 shows sample quality as a func- tion of training progress for 2M steps of class-conditional models on the ImageNet [12] dataset. We see that, i) small downsampling factors for LDM-{1,2}result in slow train- ing progress, whereas ii) overly large values offcause stag- nating ﬁdelity after comparably few training steps. Revis- iting the analysis above (Fig. 1 and 2) we attribute this to i) leaving most of perceptual compression to the diffusion model and ii) too strong ﬁrst stage compression resulting in information loss and thus limiting the achievable qual- ity. LDM-{4-16}strike a good balance between efﬁciency and perceptually faithful results, which manifests in a sig- niﬁcant FID [29] gap of 38 between pixel-based diffusion (LDM-1) and LDM-8 after 2M training steps. In Fig. 7, we compare models trained on CelebA- HQ [39] and ImageNet in terms sampling speed for differ- ent numbers of denoising steps with the DDIM sampler [84] and plot it against FID-scores [29]. LDM-{4-8}outper- form models with unsuitable ratios of perceptual and con- ceptual compression. Especially compared to pixel-based LDM-1, they achieve much lower FID scores while simulta- neously signiﬁcantly increasing sample throughput. Com- plex datasets such as ImageNet require reduced compres- sion rates to avoid reducing quality. In summary, LDM-4 and -8 offer the best conditions for achieving high-quality synthesis results. 4.2. Image Generation with Latent Diffusion We train unconditional models of 2562 images on CelebA-HQ [39], FFHQ [41], LSUN-Churches and -Bedrooms [102] and evaluate the i) sample quality and ii) their coverage of the data manifold using ii) FID [29] and ii) Precision-and-Recall [50]. Tab. 1 summarizes our re- sults. On CelebA-HQ, we report a new state-of-the-art FID of 5.11, outperforming previous likelihood-based models as well as GANs. We also outperform LSGM [93] where a la- tent diffusion model is trained jointly together with the ﬁrst stage. In contrast, we train diffusion models in a ﬁxed space 5Text-to-Image Synthesis on LAION. 1.45B Model. ’A street sign that reads “Latent Diffusion” ’ ’A zombie in the style of Picasso’ ’An image of an animal half mouse half octopus’ ’An illustration of a slightly conscious neural network’ ’A painting of a squirrel eating a burger’ ’A watercolor painting of a chair that looks like an octopus’ ’A shirt with the inscription: “I love generative models!” ’ Figure 5.

Pixel-based LDM-1 requires substantially larger train times compared to models with larger downsampling factors (LDM-{4-16}).

We outperform prior diffusion based approaches on all but the LSUN-Bedrooms dataset, where our score is close to ADM [15], despite utilizing half its parameters and re- quiring 4-times less train resources (see Appendix E.3.5).

Conditional Latent Diffusion 4.3.1 Transformer Encoders for LDMs By introducing cross-attention based conditioning into LDMs we open them up for various conditioning modali- ties previously unexplored for diffusion models. For text- to-image image modeling, we train a 1.45B parameter KL-regularized LDM conditioned on language prompts on LAION-400M [78]. We employ the BERT-tokenizer [14] and implement τθ as a transformer [97] to infer a latent code which is mapped into the UNet via (multi-head) cross- attention (Sec. 3.3). This combination of domain speciﬁc experts for learning a language representation and visual synthesis results in a powerful model, which generalizes well to complex, user-deﬁned text prompts,cf . Fig. 8 and 5. For quantitative analysis, we follow prior work and evaluate text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO [51] validation set, where our model improves upon powerful AR [17, 66] and GAN-based [109] methods, cf . Tab. 2. We note that ap- plying classiﬁer-free diffusion guidance [32] greatly boosts sample quality, such that the guidedLDM-KL-8-G is on par with the recent state-of-the-art AR [26] and diffusion mod- els [59] for text-to-image synthesis, while substantially re- ducing parameter count. To further analyze the ﬂexibility of the cross-attention based conditioning mechanism we also train models to synthesize images based on semantic lay- outs on OpenImages [49], and ﬁnetune on COCO [4], see Fig. 8. See Sec. D.3 for the quantitative evaluation and im- plementation details. Lastly, following prior work [3, 15, 21, 23], we evalu- ate our best-performing class-conditional ImageNet mod- els with f ∈ {4,8}from Sec. 4.1 in Tab. 3, Fig. 4 and Sec. D.4.

We use this to train models for semantic synthesis, super-resolution (Sec. 4.4) and inpainting (Sec. 4.5). For semantic synthe- sis, we use images of landscapes paired with semantic maps [23, 61] and concatenate downsampled versions of the se- mantic maps with the latent image representation of af = 4 model (VQ-reg., see Tab. 8). We train on an input resolution of 2562 (crops from 3842) but ﬁnd that our model general- izes to larger resolutions and can generate images up to the megapixel regime when evaluated in a convolutional man- ner (see Fig. 9). We exploit this behavior to also apply the super-resolution models in Sec. 4.4 and the inpainting mod- els in Sec. 4.5 to generate large images between 5122 and 10242. For this application, the signal-to-noise ratio (in- duced by the scale of the latent space) signiﬁcantly affects the results. In Sec. D.1 we illustrate this when learning an LDM on (i) the latent space as provided by a f = 4model (KL-reg., see Tab. 8), and (ii) a rescaled version, scaled by the component-wise standard deviation. The latter, in combination with classiﬁer-free guid- ance [32], also enables the direct synthesis of > 2562 im- ages for the text-conditional LDM-KL-8-G as in Fig. 13. Figure 9. A LDM trained on 2562 resolution can generalize to larger resolution (here: 512×1024) for spatially conditioned tasks such as semantic synthesis of landscape images. See Sec. 4.3.2. 4.4. Super-Resolution with Latent Diffusion LDMs can be efﬁciently trained for super-resolution by diretly conditioning on low-resolution images via concate- nation (cf . Sec. 3.3). In a ﬁrst experiment, we follow SR3 7bicubic LDM-SR SR3 Figure 10. ImageNet 64 →256 super-resolution on ImageNet-Val. LDM-SR has advantages at rendering realistic textures but SR3 can synthesize more coherent ﬁne structures. See appendix for additional samples and cropouts. SR3 results from [72]. [72] and ﬁx the image degradation to a bicubic interpola- tion with 4×-downsampling and train on ImageNet follow- ing SR3’s data processing pipeline. We use the f = 4au- toencoding model pretrained on OpenImages (VQ-reg., cf . Tab. 8) and concatenate the low-resolution conditioning y and the inputs to the UNet, i.e. τθ is the identity. Our quali- tative and quantitative results (see Fig. 10 and Tab. 5) show competitive performance and LDM-SR outperforms SR3 in FID while SR3 has a better IS. A simple image regres- sion model achieves the highest PSNR and SSIM scores; however these metrics do not align well with human per- ception [106] and favor blurriness over imperfectly aligned high frequency details [72]. Further, we conduct a user study comparing the pixel-baseline with LDM-SR. We fol- low SR3 [72] where human subjects were shown a low-res image in between two high-res images and asked for pref- erence. The results in Tab. 4 afﬁrm the good performance of LDM-SR. PSNR and SSIM can be pushed by using a post-hoc guiding mechanism [15] and we implement this image-based guider via a perceptual loss, see Sec. D.6.

More details in E.3.6 Since the bicubic degradation process does not generalize well to images which do not follow this pre-processing, we also train a generic model, LDM-BSR, by using more di- verse degradation.

Assessing inpainting efﬁciency. †: Deviations from Fig. 7 due to varying GPU settings/batch sizes cf . the supplement. 4.5. Inpainting with Latent Diffusion Inpainting is the task of ﬁlling masked regions of an im- age with new content either because parts of the image are are corrupted or to replace existing but undesired content within the image. We evaluate how our general approach for conditional image generation compares to more special- ized, state-of-the-art approaches for this task. Our evalua- tion follows the protocol of LaMa [88], a recent inpainting model that introduces a specialized architecture relying on Fast Fourier Convolutions [8]. The exact training & evalua- tion protocol on Places [108] is described in Sec. E.2.2. We ﬁrst analyze the effect of different design choices for the ﬁrst stage. In particular, we compare the inpainting ef- ﬁciency of LDM-1 (i.e. a pixel-based conditional DM) with LDM-4, for both KL and VQ regularizations, as well as VQ- LDM-4 without any attention in the ﬁrst stage (see Tab. 8), where the latter reduces GPU memory for decoding at high resolutions. For comparability, we ﬁx the number of param- eters for all models. Tab. 6 reports the training and sampling throughput at resolution 2562 and 5122, the total training time in hours per epoch and the FID score on the validation split after six epochs. Overall, we observe a speed-up of at least 2.7×between pixel- and latent-based diffusion models while improving FID scores by a factor of at least 1.6×. The comparison with other inpainting approaches in Tab. 7 shows that our model with attention improves the overall image quality as measured by FID over that of [88]. LPIPS between the unmasked images and our samples is slightly higher than that of [88]. We attribute this to [88] only producing a single result which tends to recover more of an average image compared to the diverse results pro- duced by our LDM cf . Fig. 21. Additionally in a user study (Tab. 4) human subjects favor our results over those of [88]. Based on these initial results, we also trained a larger dif- fusion model (big in Tab. 7) in the latent space of the VQ- regularized ﬁrst stage without attention. Following [15], the UNet of this diffusion model uses attention layers on three levels of its feature hierarchy, the BigGAN [3] residual block for up- and downsampling and has 387M parameters 8input result Figure 11. Qualitative results on object removal with our big, w/ ft inpainting model. For more results, see Fig. 22. instead of 215M. After training, we noticed a discrepancy in the quality of samples produced at resolutions 2562 and 5122, which we hypothesize to be caused by the additional attention modules. However, ﬁne-tuning the model for half an epoch at resolution 5122 allows the model to adjust to the new feature statistics and sets a new state of the art FID on image inpainting (big, w/o attn, w/ ft in Tab. 7, Fig. 11.). 5. Limitations & Societal Impact Limitations While LDMs signiﬁcantly reduce computa- tional requirements compared to pixel-based approaches, their sequential sampling process is still slower than that of GANs. Moreover, the use of LDMs can be question- able when high precision is required: although the loss of image quality is very small in ourf = 4autoencoding mod- els (see Fig. 1), their reconstruction capability can become a bottleneck for tasks that require ﬁne-grained accuracy in pixel space. We assume that our superresolution models (Sec. 4.4) are already somewhat limited in this respect.

On the other hand, it also means that it becomes easier to create and dissemi- nate manipulated data or spread misinformation and spam. In particular, the deliberate manipulation of images (“deep fakes”) is a common problem in this context, and women in particular are disproportionately affected by it [13, 24]. Generative models can also reveal their training data [5, 90], which is of great concern when the data contain sensitive or personal information and were collected with- out explicit consent. However, the extent to which this also applies to DMs of images is not yet fully understood. Finally, deep learning modules tend to reproduce or ex- acerbate biases that are already present in the data [22, 38, 91]. While diffusion models achieve better coverage of the data distribution than e.g. GAN-based approaches, the ex- tent to which our two-stage approach that combines adver- sarial training and a likelihood-based objective misrepre- sents the data remains an important research question. For a more general, detailed discussion of the ethical considerations of deep generative models, see e.g. [13]. 6. Conclusion We have presented latent diffusion models, a simple and efﬁcient way to signiﬁcantly improve both the training and sampling efﬁciency of denoising diffusion models with- out degrading their quality. Based on this and our cross- attention conditioning mechanism, our experiments could demonstrate favorable results compared to state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conditional image synthesis tasks without task-speciﬁc architectures.

Changelog Here we list changes between this version ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752v2 ) of the paper and the previous version, i.e. https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752v1. • We updated the results on text-to-image synthesis in Sec. 4.3 which were obtained by training a new, larger model (1.45B parameters). This also includes a new comparison to very recent competing methods on this task that were published on arXiv at the same time as ( [59, 109]) or after ( [26]) the publication of our work. • We updated results on class-conditional synthesis on ImageNet in Sec. 4.1, Tab. 3 (see also Sec. D.4) obtained by retraining the model with a larger batch size. The corresponding qualitative results in Fig. 26 and Fig. 27 were also updated. Both the updated text-to-image and the class-conditional model now use classiﬁer-free guidance [32] as a measure to increase visual ﬁdelity. • We conducted a user study (following the scheme suggested by Saharia et al [72]) which provides additional evaluation for our inpainting (Sec. 4.5) and superresolution models (Sec. 4.4). • Added Fig. 5 to the main paper, moved Fig. 18 to the appendix, added Fig. 13 to the appendix. B. Detailed Information on Denoising Diffusion Models Diffusion models can be speciﬁed in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio SNR (t) = α2 t σ2 t consisting of sequences (αt)T t=1 and (σt)T t=1 which, starting from a data sample x0, deﬁne a forward diffusion process qas q(xt|x0) =N(xt|αtx0,σ2 tI) (4) with the Markov structure for s<t : q(xt|xs) =N(xt|αt|sxs,σ2 t|sI) (5) αt|s = αt αs (6) σ2 t|s = σ2 t −α2 t|sσ2 s (7) Denoising diffusion models are generative modelsp(x0) which revert this process with a similar Markov structure running backward in time, i.e. they are speciﬁed as p(x0) = ∫ z p(xT) T∏ t=1 p(xt−1|xt) (8) The evidence lower bound (ELBO) associated with this model then decomposes over the discrete time steps as −log p(x0) ≤KL(q(xT|x0)|p(xT)) + T∑ t=1 Eq(xt|x0)KL(q(xt−1|xt,x0)|p(xt−1|xt)) (9) The prior p(xT) is typically choosen as a standard normal distribution and the ﬁrst term of the ELBO then depends only on the ﬁnal signal-to-noise ratio SNR(T). To minimize the remaining terms, a common choice to parameterize p(xt−1|xt) is to specify it in terms of the true posterior q(xt−1|xt,x0) but with the unknown x0 replaced by an estimate xθ(xt,t) based on the current step xt. This gives [45] p(xt−1|xt) := q(xt−1|xt,xθ(xt,t)) (10) = N(xt−1|µθ(xt,t),σ2 t|t−1 σ2 t−1 σ2 t I), (11) where the mean can be expressed as µθ(xt,t) =αt|t−1σ2 t−1 σ2 t xt + αt−1σ2 t|t−1 σ2 t xθ(xt,t). (12) 16In this case, the sum of the ELBO simplify to T∑ t=1 Eq(xt|x0)KL(q(xt−1|xt,x0)|p(xt−1) = T∑ t=1 EN(ϵ|0,I) 1 2(SNR(t−1) −SNR(t))∥x0 −xθ(αtx0 + σtϵ,t)∥2 (13) Following [30], we use the reparameterization ϵθ(xt,t) = (xt −αtxθ(xt,t))/σt (14) to express the reconstruction term as a denoising objective, ∥x0 −xθ(αtx0 + σtϵ,t)∥2= σ2 t α2 t ∥ϵ−ϵθ(αtx0 + σtϵ,t)∥2 (15) and the reweighting, which assigns each of the terms the same weight and results in Eq. (1). 17C. Image Guiding Mechanisms Samples 2562 Guided Convolutional Samples 5122 Convolutional Samples 5122 Figure 14. On landscapes, convolutional sampling with unconditional models can lead to homogeneous and incoherent global structures (see column 2). L2-guiding with a low resolution image can help to reestablish coherent global structures. An intriguing feature of diffusion models is that unconditional models can be conditioned at test-time [15, 82, 85]. In particular, [15] presented an algorithm to guide both unconditional and conditional models trained on the ImageNet dataset with a classiﬁer log pΦ(y|xt), trained on each xt of the diffusion process. We directly build on this formulation and introduce post-hoc image-guiding: For an epsilon-parameterized model with ﬁxed variance, the guiding algorithm as introduced in [15] reads: ˆϵ←ϵθ(zt,t) + √ 1 −α2 t ∇zt log pΦ(y|zt) . (16) This can be interpreted as an update correcting the “score” ϵθ with a conditional distribution log pΦ(y|zt). So far, this scenario has only been applied to single-class classiﬁcation models. We re-interpret the guiding distribution pΦ(y|T(D(z0(zt)))) as a general purpose image-to-image translation task given a target image y, where T can be any differentiable transformation adopted to the image-to-image translation task at hand, such as the identity, a downsampling operation or similar. 18As an example, we can assume a Gaussian guider with ﬁxed variance σ2 = 1, such that log pΦ(y|zt) =−1 2∥y−T(D(z0(zt)))∥2 2 (17) becomes a L2 regression objective. Fig. 14 demonstrates how this formulation can serve as an upsampling mechanism of an unconditional model trained on 2562 images, where unconditional samples of size 2562 guide the convolutional synthesis of 5122 images and T is a 2× bicubic downsampling. Following this motivation, we also experiment with a perceptual similarity guiding and replace the L2 objective with the LPIPS [106] metric, see Sec. 4.4. 19D. Additional Results D.1. Choosing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio for High-Resolution Synthesis KL-reg, w/o rescaling KL-reg, w/ rescaling VQ-reg, w/o rescaling Figure 15. Illustrating the effect of latent space rescaling on convolutional sampling, here for semantic image synthesis on landscapes. See Sec. 4.3.2 and Sec. D.1. As discussed in Sec. 4.3.2, the signal-to-noise ratio induced by the variance of the latent space (i.e. Var(z)/σ2 t) signiﬁcantly affects the results for convolutional sampling. For example, when training a LDM directly in the latent space of a KL- regularized model (see Tab. 8), this ratio is very high, such that the model allocates a lot of semantic detail early on in the reverse denoising process. In contrast, when rescaling the latent space by the component-wise standard deviation of the latents as described in Sec. G, the SNR is descreased. We illustrate the effect on convolutional sampling for semantic image synthesis in Fig. 15. Note that the VQ-regularized space has a variance close to 1, such that it does not have to be rescaled. D.2. Full List of all First Stage Models We provide a complete list of various autoenconding models trained on the OpenImages dataset in Tab. 8. D.3. Layout-to-Image Synthesis Here we provide the quantitative evaluation and additional samples for our layout-to-image models from Sec. 4.3.1. We train a model on the COCO [4] and one on the OpenImages [49] dataset, which we subsequently additionally ﬁnetune on COCO. Tab 9 shows the result. Our COCO model reaches the performance of recent state-of-the art models in layout-to- image synthesis, when following their training and evaluation protocol [89]. When ﬁnetuning from the OpenImages model, we surpass these works. Our OpenImages model surpasses the results of Jahn et al [37] by a margin of nearly 11 in terms of FID. In Fig. 16 we show additional samples of the model ﬁnetuned on COCO. D.4. Class-Conditional Image Synthesis on ImageNet Tab. 10 contains the results for our class-conditional LDM measured in FID and Inception score (IS). LDM-8 requires signiﬁcantly fewer parameters and compute requirements (see Tab. 18) to achieve very competitive performance. Similar to previous work, we can further boost the performance by training a classiﬁer on each noise scale and guiding with it, 20f |Z| c R-FID ↓ R-IS ↑ PSNR ↑ PSIM ↓ SSIM ↑ 16 VQGAN [23] 16384 256 4.98 – 19.9 ±3.4 1.83 ±0.42 0.51 ±0.18 16 VQGAN [23] 1024 256 7.94 – 19.4 ±3.3 1.98 ±0.43 0.50 ±0.18 8 DALL-E [66] 8192 - 32.01 – 22.8 ±2.1 1.95 ±0.51 0.73 ±0.13 32 16384 16 31.83 40.40 ±1.07 17.45 ±2.90 2.58 ±0.48 0.41 ±0.18 16 16384 8 5.15 144.55 ±3.74 20.83 ±3.61 1.73 ±0.43 0.54 ±0.18 8 16384 4 1.14 201.92 ±3.97 23.07 ±3.99 1.17 ±0.36 0.65 ±0.16 8 256 4 1.49 194.20 ±3.87 22.35 ±3.81 1.26 ±0.37 0.62 ±0.16 4 8192 3 0.58 224.78 ±5.35 27.43 ±4.26 0.53 ±0.21 0.82 ±0.10 4† 8192 3 1.06 221.94 ±4.58 25.21 ±4.17 0.72 ±0.26 0.76 ±0.12 4 256 3 0.47 223.81 ±4.58 26.43 ±4.22 0.62 ±0.24 0.80 ±0.11 2 2048 2 0.16 232.75 ±5.09 30.85 ±4.12 0.27 ±0.12 0.91 ±0.05 2 64 2 0.40 226.62 ±4.83 29.13 ±3.46 0.38 ±0.13 0.90 ±0.05 32 KL 64 2.04 189.53 ±3.68 22.27 ±3.93 1.41 ±0.40 0.61 ±0.17 32 KL 16 7.3 132.75 ±2.71 20.38 ±3.56 1.88 ±0.45 0.53 ±0.18 16 KL 16 0.87 210.31 ±3.97 24.08 ±4.22 1.07 ±0.36 0.68 ±0.15 16 KL 8 2.63 178.68 ±4.08 21.94 ±3.92 1.49 ±0.42 0.59 ±0.17 8 KL 4 0.90 209.90 ±4.92 24.19 ±4.19 1.02 ±0.35 0.69 ±0.15 4 KL 3 0.27 227.57 ±4.89 27.53 ±4.54 0.55 ±0.24 0.82 ±0.11 2 KL 2 0.086 232.66 ±5.16 32.47 ±4.19 0.20 ±0.09 0.93 ±0.04 Table 8.

D.5. Sample Quality vs. V100 Days (Continued from Sec. 4.1) Figure 17. For completeness we also report the training progress of class-conditional LDMs on the ImageNet dataset for a ﬁxed number of 35 V100 days. Results obtained with 100 DDIM steps [84] and κ= 0. FIDs computed on 5000 samples for efﬁciency reasons. For the assessment of sample quality over the training progress in Sec. 4.1, we reported FID and IS scores as a function of train steps. Another possibility is to report these metrics over the used resources in V100 days. Such an analysis is additionally provided in Fig. 17, showing qualitatively similar results. 22Method FID ↓ IS ↑ PSNR ↑ SSIM ↑ Image Regression [72] 15.2 121.1 27.9 0.801 SR3 [72] 5.2 180.1 26.4 0.762 LDM-4 (ours, 100 steps) 2.8†/4.8‡ 166.3 24.4 ±3.8 0.69±0.14 LDM-4 (ours, 50 steps, guiding) 4.4 †/6.4‡ 153.7 25.8 ±3.7 0.74±0.12 LDM-4 (ours, 100 steps, guiding) 4.4 †/6.4‡ 154.1 25.7 ±3.7 0.73±0.12 LDM-4 (ours, 100 steps, +15 ep.) 2.6†/ 4.6‡ 169.76±5.03 24.4±3.8 0.69±0.14 Pixel-DM (100 steps, +15 ep.) 5.1 †/ 7.1‡ 163.06±4.67 24.1±3.3 0.59±0.12 Table 11. ×4 upscaling results on ImageNet-Val.

The last two rows received 15 epochs of additional training compared to the former results. D.6. Super-Resolution For better comparability between LDMs and diffusion models in pixel space, we extend our analysis from Tab. 5 by comparing a diffusion model trained for the same number of steps and with a comparable number 1 of parameters to our LDM. The results of this comparison are shown in the last two rows of Tab. 11 and demonstrate that LDM achieves better performance while allowing for signiﬁcantly faster sampling. A qualitative comparison is given in Fig. 20 which shows random samples from both LDM and the diffusion model in pixel space. D.6.1 LDM-BSR: General Purpose SR Model via Diverse Image Degradation bicubic LDM-SR LDM-BSR Figure 18. LDM-BSR generalizes to arbitrary inputs and can be used as a general-purpose upsampler, upscaling samples from a class- conditional LDM (image cf . Fig. 4) to10242 resolution. In contrast, using a ﬁxed degradation process (see Sec. 4.4) hinders generalization. To evaluate generalization of our LDM-SR, we apply it both on synthetic LDM samples from a class-conditional ImageNet model (Sec. 4.1) and images crawled from the internet. Interestingly, we observe that LDM-SR, trained only with a bicubicly downsampled conditioning as in [72], does not generalize well to images which do not follow this pre-processing. Hence, to obtain a superresolution model for a wide range of real world images, which can contain complex superpositions of camera noise, compression artifacts, blurr and interpolations, we replace the bicubic downsampling operation in LDM-SR with the degration pipeline from [105]. The BSR-degradation process is a degradation pipline which applies JPEG compressions noise, camera sensor noise, different image interpolations for downsampling, Gaussian blur kernels and Gaussian noise in a random order to an image. We found that using the bsr-degredation process with the original parameters as in [105] leads to a very strong degradation process. Since a more moderate degradation process seemed apppropiate for our application, we adapted the parameters of the bsr-degradation (our adapted degradation process can be found in our code base at https: //github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion ). Fig. 18 illustrates the effectiveness of this approach by directly comparing LDM-SR with LDM-BSR. The latter produces images much sharper than the models conﬁned to a ﬁxed pre- processing, making it suitable for real-world applications. Further results of LDM-BSR are shown on LSUN-cows in Fig. 19. 1It is not possible to exactly match both architectures since the diffusion model operates in the pixel space 23E.

Implementation Details E.2.1 Implementations of τθ for conditional LDMs For the experiments on text-to-image and layout-to-image (Sec. 4.3.1) synthesis, we implement the conditioner τθ as an unmasked transformer which processes a tokenized version of the input y and produces an output ζ := τθ(y), where ζ ∈ RM×dτ. More speciﬁcally, the transformer is implemented from N transformer blocks consisting of global self-attention layers, layer-normalization and position-wise MLPs as follows2: 2adapted from https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers 24LDM-1 LDM-2 LDM-4 LDM-8 LDM-16 LDM-32 z-shape 256×256×3 128 ×128×2 64 ×64×3 32 ×32×4 16 ×16×8 88 ×8×32 |Z| - 2048 8192 16384 16384 16384 Diffusion steps 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 Noise Schedule linear linear linear linear linear linear Model Size 270M 265M 274M 258M 260M 258M Channels 192 192 224 256 256 256 Depth 2 2 2 2 2 2 Channel Multiplier 1,1,2,2,4,4 1,2,2,4,4 1,2,3,4 1,2,4 1,2,4 1,2,4 Attention resolutions 32, 16, 8 32, 16, 8 32, 16, 8 32, 16, 8 16, 8, 4 8, 4, 2 Head Channels 32 32 32 32 32 32 Batch Size 9 11 48 96 128 128 Iterations∗ 500k 500k 500k 500k 500k 500k Learning Rate 9e-5 1.1e-4 9.6e-5 9.6e-5 1.3e-4 1.3e-4 Table 14.

We modify the “ablated UNet” [15] architecture and replace the self-attention layer with a shallow (unmasked) transformer consisting of T blocks with alternating layers of (i) self-attention, (ii) a position-wise MLP and (iii) a cross-attention layer; 25see Tab. 16. Note that without (ii) and (iii), this architecture is equivalent to the “ablated UNet”. While it would be possible to increase the representational power ofτθ by additionally conditioning on the time step t, we do not pursue this choice as it reduces the speed of inference. We leave a more detailed analysis of this modiﬁcation to future work. For the text-to-image model, we rely on a publicly available 3 tokenizer [99]. The layout-to-image model discretizes the spatial locations of the bounding boxes and encodes each box as a (l,b,c )-tuple, where ldenotes the (discrete) top-left and b the bottom-right position. Class information is contained in c. See Tab. 17 for the hyperparameters ofτθ and Tab. 13 for those of the UNet for both of the above tasks. Note that the class-conditional model as described in Sec. 4.1 is also implemented via cross-attention, whereτθ is a single learnable embedding layer with a dimensionality of 512, mapping classes yto ζ ∈R1×512. input Rh×w×c LayerNorm Rh×w×c Conv1x1 Rh×w×d·nh Reshape Rh·w×d·nh ×T    SelfAttention MLP CrossAttention Rh·w×d·nh Rh·w×d·nh Rh·w×d·nh Reshape Rh×w×d·nh Conv1x1 Rh×w×c Table 16.

Hyperparameters for the experiments with transformer encoders in Sec. 4.3. E.2.2 Inpainting For our experiments on image-inpainting in Sec. 4.5, we used the code of [88] to generate synthetic masks. We use a ﬁxed set of 2k validation and 30k testing samples from Places [108]. During training, we use random crops of size 256 ×256 and evaluate on crops of size 512 ×512. This follows the training and testing protocol in [88] and reproduces their reported metrics (see †in Tab. 7). We include additional qualitative results of LDM-4, w/ attn in Fig. 21 and of LDM-4, w/o attn, big, w/ ft in Fig. 22. E.3. Evaluation Details This section provides additional details on evaluation for the experiments shown in Sec. 4. E.3.1 Quantitative Results in Unconditional and Class-Conditional Image Synthesis We follow common practice and estimate the statistics for calculating the FID-, Precision- and Recall-scores [29,50] shown in Tab. 1 and 10 based on 50k samples from our models and the entire training set of each of the shown datasets. For calculating FID scores we use the torch-fidelity package [60]. However, since different data processing pipelines might lead to different results [64], we also evaluate our models with the script provided by Dhariwal and Nichol [15]. We ﬁnd that results 3https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#berttokenizerfast 26mainly coincide, except for the ImageNet and LSUN-Bedrooms datasets, where we notice slightly varying scores of 7.76 (torch-fidelity) vs. 7.77 (Nichol and Dhariwal) and 2.95 vs 3.0. For the future we emphasize the importance of a uniﬁed procedure for sample quality assessment. Precision and Recall are also computed by using the script provided by Nichol and Dhariwal. E.3.2 Text-to-Image Synthesis Following the evaluation protocol of [66] we compute FID and Inception Score for the Text-to-Image models from Tab. 2 by comparing generated samples with 30000 samples from the validation set of the MS-COCO dataset [51]. FID and Inception Scores are computed with torch-fidelity. E.3.3 Layout-to-Image Synthesis For assessing the sample quality of our Layout-to-Image models from Tab. 9 on the COCO dataset, we follow common practice [37, 87, 89] and compute FID scores the 2048 unaugmented examples of the COCO Segmentation Challenge split. To obtain better comparability, we use the exact same samples as in [37]. For the OpenImages dataset we similarly follow their protocol and use 2048 center-cropped test images from the validation set. E.3.4 Super Resolution We evaluate the super-resolution models on ImageNet following the pipeline suggested in [72], i.e. images with a shorter size less than 256 px are removed (both for training and evaluation). On ImageNet, the low-resolution images are produced using bicubic interpolation with anti-aliasing. FIDs are evaluated using torch-fidelity [60], and we produce samples on the validation split. For FID scores, we additionally compare to reference features computed on the train split, see Tab. 5 and Tab. 11. E.3.5 Efﬁciency Analysis For efﬁciency reasons we compute the sample quality metrics plotted in Fig. 6, 17 and 7 based on 5k samples. Therefore, the results might vary from those shown in Tab. 1 and 10. All models have a comparable number of parameters as provided in Tab. 13 and 14. We maximize the learning rates of the individual models such that they still train stably. Therefore, the learning rates slightly vary between different runs cf . Tab. 13 and 14. E.3.6 User Study For the results of the user study presented in Tab. 4 we followed the protocoll of [72] and and use the 2-alternative force-choice paradigm to assess human preference scores for two distinct tasks. In Task-1 subjects were shown a low resolution/masked image between the corresponding ground truth high resolution/unmasked version and a synthesized image, which was gen- erated by using the middle image as conditioning. For SuperResolution subjects were asked: ’Which of the two images is a better high quality version of the low resolution image in the middle?’ . For Inpainting we asked ’Which of the two images contains more realistic inpainted regions of the image in the middle?’ . In Task-2, humans were similarly shown the low- res/masked version and asked for preference between two corresponding images generated by the two competing methods. As in [72] humans viewed the images for 3 seconds before responding. 27F.

[15]. As they report their used compute in V100 days and we train all our models on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, we convert the A100 days to V100 days by assuming a×2.2 speedup of A100 vs V100 [74]4. To assess sample quality, we additionally report FID scores on the reported datasets. We closely reach the performance of state of the art methods as StyleGAN2 [42] and ADM [15] while signiﬁcantly reducing the required compute resources. 4This factor corresponds to the speedup of the A100 over the V100 for a U-Net, as deﬁned in Fig. 1 in [74] 28G. Details on Autoencoder Models We train all our autoencoder models in an adversarial manner following [23], such that a patch-based discriminator Dψ is optimized to differentiate original images from reconstructions D(E(x)). To avoid arbitrarily scaled latent spaces, we regularize the latent zto be zero centered and obtain small variance by introducing an regularizing loss term Lreg. We investigate two different regularization methods: (i) a low-weighted Kullback-Leibler-term between qE(z|x) = N(z; Eµ,Eσ2 ) and a standard normal distribution N(z; 0,1) as in a standard variational autoencoder [46, 69], and, (ii) regu- larizing the latent space with a vector quantization layer by learning a codebook of |Z|different exemplars [96]. To obtain high-ﬁdelity reconstructions we only use a very small regularization for both scenarios, i.e. we either weight the KL term by a factor ∼10−6 or choose a high codebook dimensionality |Z|. The full objective to train the autoencoding model (E,D) reads: LAutoencoder = min E,D max ψ ( Lrec(x,D(E(x))) −Ladv(D(E(x))) + logDψ(x) +Lreg(x; E,D) ) (25) DM Training in Latent Space Note that for training diffusion models on the learned latent space, we again distinguish two cases when learningp(z) or p(z|y) (Sec. 4.3): (i) For a KL-regularized latent space, we samplez= Eµ(x)+Eσ(x)·ε=: E(x), where ε∼N(0,1). When rescaling the latent, we estimate the component-wise variance ˆσ2 = 1 bchw ∑ b,c,h,w (zb,c,h,w −ˆµ)2 from the ﬁrst batch in the data, where ˆµ= 1 bchw ∑ b,c,h,wzb,c,h,w. The output of Eis scaled such that the rescaled latent has unit standard deviation, i.e. z←z ˆσ = E(x) ˆσ . (ii) For a VQ-regularized latent space, we extract zbefore the quantization layer and absorb the quantization operation into the decoder, i.e. it can be interpreted as the ﬁrst layer of D. H. Additional Qualitative Results Finally, we provide additional qualitative results for our landscapes model (Fig. 12, 23, 24 and 25), our class-conditional ImageNet model (Fig. 26 - 27) and our unconditional models for the CelebA-HQ, FFHQ and LSUN datasets (Fig. 28 - 31). Similar as for the inpainting model in Sec. 4.5 we also ﬁne-tuned the semantic landscapes model from Sec. 4.3.2 directly on 5122 images and depict qualitative results in Fig. 12 and Fig. 23.

One notable example of an SGM are denoising diﬀusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [ Soh+15; HJA20], which are a key component in large- scale generative models such as DALL ·E 2 [ Ram+22]. As the importance of SGMs continues to grow due to newfound applications in commercial domains, it is a pressing quest ion of both practical and theoretical concern to understand the mathematical underpinnings which exp lain their startling empirical successes. As we explain in more detail in Section 2, at their mathematical core, SGMs consist of two stochastic processes, which we call the forward process and the reverse pr ocess. The forward process transforms samples from a data distribution q (e.g., natural images) into pure noise, whereas the reverse proce ss transforms pure noise into samples from q, hence performing generative modeling. Implementation of the rev erse process requires estimation of the score function of the law of the forward process, which is typically accomplished by training neural networks on a score matching objective [ Hyv05; Vin11; SE19]. Providing precise guarantees for estimation of the score function is diﬃcult, as it requires an understanding of the non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimizatio n that is currently out of reach. However, given the empirical success of neural networks on the score estim ation task, a natural and important question is whether or not accurate score estimation implies that SGMs prova bly converge to the true data distribution in realistic settings. This is a surprisingly delicate question, as even wit h accurate score estimates, as we ∗Department of EECS at University of California, Berkeley, sitan@seas.harvard.edu. †Department of Mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Te chnology, schewi@mit.edu. Part of this work was done while SC was a research intern at Microsoft Research. ‡Microsoft Research, jerrl@microsoft.com. §Microsoft Research and Machine Learning Department at Carn egie Mellon University, yuanzhil@andrew.cmu.edu. ¶Microsoft Research, adilsalim@microsoft.com. ‖Departments of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Computer S cience, Mathematics, and Statistical Science at Duke Unive rsity, anru.zhang@duke.edu. 1explain in Section 2.1, there are several other sources of error which could cause the SGM to fail to converge. Indeed, despite a ﬂurry of recent work on this question [ De +21 ; BMR22; De 22 ; Liu+22; LLT22; Pid22], prior analyses fall short of answering this question, for (at least) one of three main reasons: 1. Super-polynomial convergence. The bounds obtained are not quantitative (e.g., [ De +21 ; Liu+22; Pid22]), or scale exponentially in the dimension and other problem paramete rs [ BMR22; De 22 ], and hence are typically vacuous for the high-dimensional settings of int erest in practice. 2. Strong assumptions on the data distribution. The bounds require strong assumptions on the true data distribution, such as a log-Sobelev inequality (LSI) (see, e.g., [ LLT22]). While the LSI is slightly weaker than log-concavity, it ultimately precludes the presence of substantial non-convexity, which im- pedes the application of these results to complex and highly multi-mod al real-world data distributions. Indeed, obtaining a polynomial-time convergence analysis for SGMs t hat holds for multi-modal distribu- tions was posed as an open question in [ LLT22]. 3. Strong assumptions on the score estimation error. The bounds require that the score estimate is L∞-accurate (i.e., uniformly accurate), as opposed to L2-accurate (see, e.g., [ De +21 ]). This is particularly problematic because the score matching objective is an L2 loss (see Section 2 for details), and there are empirical studies suggesting that in practice, the score estimate is not in fact L∞-accurate (e.g., [ ZC23]). Intuitively, this is because we cannot expect that the score estima te we obtain in practice will be accurate in regions of space where the true density is very low, simply because we do not expect to see many (or indeed, any) samples from such regions. Providing an analysis which goes beyond these limitations is a pressing ﬁ rst step towards theoretically understanding why SGMs actually work in practice. Concurrent work. The concurrent and independent work of [ LLT23] also obtains similar guarantees to our Corollary 3. 1.1 Our contributions In this work, we take a step towards bridging theory and practice b y providing a convergence guarantee for SGMs, under realistic (in fact, quite minimal) assumptions, which s cales polynomially in all relevant problem parameters. Namely, our main result (Theorem 2) only requires the following assumptions on the data distribution q, which we make more quantitative in Section 3: A1 The score function of the forward process is L-Lipschitz. A2 The second moment of q is ﬁnite. A3 The data distribution q has ﬁnite KL divergence w.r.t. the standard Gaussian. We note that all of these assumptions are either standard or, in th e case of A2, far weaker than what is needed in prior work. Crucially, unlike prior works, we do not assume log-concavity, an LSI, or dissipativity; hence, our assumptions cover arbitrarily non-log-concave data distributions. Our main result is summarized informally as follows. Theorem 1 (informal, see Theorem 2). Under assumptions A1-A3, and if the score estimation error in L2 is at most ˜O(ε), then with an appropriate choice of step size, the SGM output s a measure which is ε-close in total variation (TV) distance to q in ˜O(L2d/ε 2) iterations. We remark that our iteration complexity is actually quite tight: in fact , this matches state-of-the-art discretization guarantees for the Langevin diﬀusion [ VW19; Che+21a]. We ﬁnd Theorem 1 to be quite surprising, because it shows that SGMs can sample from t he data distribution q with polynomial complexity, even when q is highly non-log-concave (a task that is usually intractable), provided that one has access to an accurate score estimator . This answers the open question of [ LLT22] regarding whether or not SGMs can sample from multimodal distribu tions, e.g., mixtures of distributions with bounded log-Sobolev constant. In the context o f neural networks, our result implies that 2so long as the neural network succeeds at the learning task, the r emaining part of the SGM algorithm based on the diﬀusion model is principled, in that it admits a strong theoretic al justiﬁcation. In general, learning the score function is also a diﬃcult task. Nevert heless, our result opens the door to further investigations, such as: do score functions for real-lif e data have intrinsic (e.g., low-dimensional) structure which can be exploited by neural networks? A positive an swer to this question, combined with our sampling result, would then provide an end-to-end guarantee for S GMs. More generally, our result can be viewed as a black-box reduction of the task of sampling to the task of learning the score function of the forward process, at least for d istributions satisfying our mild assumptions. As a simple consequence, existing computational hardness results for learning natural high-dimensional dis- tributions like mixtures of Gaussians [ DKS17; Bru+21; GVV22] and pushforwards of Gaussians by shallow ReLU networks [ DV21; Che+22a; CLL22] immediately imply hardness of score estimation for these distri- butions. To our knowledge this yields the ﬁrst known information-co mputation gaps for this task. Arbitrary distributions with bounded support. The assumption that the score function is Lipschitz entails in particular that the data distribution has a density w.r.t. Leb esgue measure; in particular, our theorem fails when q satisﬁes the manifold hypothesis, i.e., is supported on a lower-dimens ional submanifold of Rd. But this is for good reason: it is not possible to obtain non-trivial TV guarantees, because the output distribution of the SGM has full support. Instead, we show in Sectio n 3.2 that we can obtain polynomial convergence guarantees in the Wasserstein metric by stopping th e SGM algorithm early, under the sole assumption that that data distribution q has bounded support. Since any data distribution encountered in real life satisﬁes this assumption, our results yield the following comp elling takeaway: Given an L2-accurate score estimate, SGMs can sample from (essentiall y) any data distribution . This constitutes a powerful theoretical justiﬁcation for the use of SGMs in practice. Critically damped Langevin diﬀusion (CLD). Using our techniques, we also investigate the use of the critically damped Langevin diﬀusion (CLD) for SGMs, which was propos ed in [ DVK22]. Although numerical experiments and intuition from the log-concave sampling literature s uggest that the CLD could potentially speed up sampling via SGMs, we provide theoretical evidence to the c ontrary: in Section 3.3, we conjecture that SGMs based on the CLD do not exhibit improved dimension depend ence compared to the original DDPM algorithm. 1.2 Prior work We now provide a more detailed comparison to prior work, in addition to the previous discussion above. By now, there is a vast literature on providing precise complexity est imates for log-concave sampling; see, e.g., the book draft [ Che22] for an exposition to recent developments. The proofs in this work build upon the techniques developed in this literature. However, our work add resses the signiﬁcantly more challenging setting of non-log-concave sampling. The work of [ De +21 ] provides guarantees for the diﬀusion Schr¨ odinger bridge [ Son+21b]. However, as previously mentioned their result is not quantitative, and they requ ire an L∞-accurate score estimate. The works [ BMR22; LLT22] instead analyze SGMs under the more realistic assumption of an L2-accurate score estimate. However, the bounds of [ BMR22] suﬀer from the curse of dimensionality, whereas the bounds of [ LLT22] require q to satisfy an LSI. The recent work of [ De 22 ], motivated by the manifold hypothesis , considers a diﬀerent pointwise as- sumption on the score estimation error which allows the error to blow up at time 0 and at spatial ∞. We discuss the manifold setting in more detail in Section 3.2. Unfortunately, the bounds of [ De 22 ] also scale exponentially in problem parameters such as the manifold diameter. After the ﬁrst version of this work appeared online, we became awa re of two concurrent and independent works [ Liu+22; LLT23] which share similarities with our work. Namely, [ Liu+22] uses a similar proof technique as our Theorem 2 (albeit without explicit quantitative bounds), whereas [ LLT23] obtains similar guarantees to our Corollary 3 below. The follow-up work of [ CLL23] further improves upon the results in this paper. We also mention that the use of reversed SDEs for sampling is also implic it in the interpretation of the proximal sampler algorithm [ LST21] given in [ Che+22b], and the present work can be viewed as expanding upon the theory of [ Che+22b] using a diﬀerent forward channel (the OU process). 32 Background on SGMs Throughout this paper, given a probability measure p which admits a density w.r.t. Lebesgue measure, we abuse notation and identify it with its density function. Additionally , we will let q denote the data distribution from which we want to generate new samples. We assume that q is a probability measure on Rd with full support, and that it admits a smooth density. (See, howev er, Section 3.2 on applications of our results to the case when q does not admit a density, such as the case when q is supported on a lower- dimensional submanifold of Rd.) In this case, we can write the density of q in the form q = exp( −U), where U : Rd → R is the potential. In this section, we provide a brief exposition to SGMs, following [ Son+21b]. 2.1 Background on denoising diﬀusion probabilistic modeli ng (DDPM) Forward process. In denoising diﬀusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM), we start with a for ward process, which is a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE). For clarity, we con sider the simplest possible choice, which is the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process d ¯Xt = − ¯Xt dt + √ 2 dBt , ¯X0 ∼ q , (2.1) where ( Bt)t≥0 is a standard Brownian motion in Rd. The OU process is the unique time-homogeneous Markov process which is also a Gaussian process, with stationary dis tribution equal to the standard Gaussian distribution γd on Rd. In practice, it is also common to introduce a positive smooth functio n g : R+ → R and consider the time-rescaled OU process d ¯Xt = −g(t)2 ¯Xt dt + √ 2 g(t) dBt , X 0 ∼ q , (2.2) but in this work we stick with the choice g ≡ 1. The forward process has the interpretation of transforming sam ples from the data distribution q into pure noise. From the well-developed theory of Markov diﬀusions, it is known that if qt := law( Xt) denotes the law of the OU process at time t, then qt → γd exponentially fast in various divergences and metrics such as the 2-Wasserstein metric W2; see [ BGL14]. Reverse process. If we reverse the forward process ( 2.1) in time, then we obtain a process that transforms noise into samples from q, which is the aim of generative modeling. In general, suppose that we have an SDE of the form d ¯Xt = bt( ¯Xt) dt + σt dBt , where (σt)t≥0 is a deterministic matrix-valued process. Then, under mild conditions on the process (e.g., [ F¨ ol85; Cat+22]), which are satisﬁed for all processes under consideration in this w ork, the reverse process also ad- mits an SDE description. Namely, if we ﬁx the terminal time T > 0 and set ¯X← t := ¯XT −t , for t ∈ [0, T ] , then the process ( ¯X← t )t∈[0,T ] satisﬁes the SDE d ¯X← t = b← t ( ¯X← t ) dt + σT −t dBt , where the backwards drift satisﬁes the relation bt + b← T −t = σtσT t ∇ ln qt , q t := law( ¯Xt) . (2.3) Applying this to the forward process ( 2.1), we obtain the reverse process d ¯X← t = { ¯X← t + 2 ∇ ln qT −t( ¯X← t )} dt + √ 2 dBt , ¯X← 0 ∼ qT , (2.4) where now ( Bt)t∈[0,T ] is the reversed Brownian motion. 1 Here, ∇ ln qt is called the score function for qt. Since q (and hence qt for t ≥ 0) is not explicitly known, in order to implement the reverse process t he score function must be estimated on the basis of samples. 1For ease of notation, we do not distinguish between the forwa rd and the reverse Brownian motions. 4Score matching. In order to estimate the score function ∇ ln qt, consider minimizing the L2(qt) loss over a function class F, minimize st∈F Eqt [∥st − ∇ ln qt∥2] , (2.5) where F could be, e.g., a class of neural networks. The idea of score matchin g, which goes back to [ Hyv05; Vin11], is that after applying integration by parts for the Gaussian measu re, the problem ( 2.5) is equivalent to the following problem: minimize st∈F E [   st( ¯Xt) + 1 √ 1 − exp(−2t) Zt    2] , (2.6) where Zt ∼ normal(0, I d) is independent of ¯X0 and ¯Xt = exp( −t) ¯X0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) Zt, in the sense that ( 2.5) and ( 2.6) share the same minimizers. We give a self-contained derivation in App endix A for the sake of completeness. Unlike ( 2.5), however, the objective in ( 2.6) can be replaced with an empirical version and estimated on the basis of samples ¯X(1) 0 , . . . , ¯X(n) 0 from q, leading to the ﬁnite-sample problem minimize st∈F 1 n n∑ i=1   st( ¯X(i) t ) + 1 √ 1 − exp(−2t) Z(i) t    2 , (2.7) where ( Z(i) t )i∈[n] are i.i.d. standard Gaussians independent of the data ( ¯X(i) 0 )i∈[n]. Moreover, if we parame- terize the score function as st = − 1 √ 1−exp(−2t) ˆzt, then the empirical problem is equivalent to minimize ˆzt∈− √ 1−exp(−2t) F 1 n n∑ i=1  ˆzt( ¯X(i) t ) − Z(i) t  2 , which has the illuminating interpretation of predicting the added noise Z(i) t from the noised data ¯X(i) t . We remark that given the objective function ( 2.5), it is most natural to assume an L2(qt) error bound Eqt [∥st − ∇ ln qt∥2] ≤ ε2 score for the score estimator. If st is taken to be the empirical risk minimizer for an appropriate function class, then guarantees for the L2(qt) error can be obtained via standard statistical analysis, as was done in [ BMR22]. Discretization and implementation. We now discuss the ﬁnal steps required to obtain an imple- mentable algorithm. First, in the learning phase, given samples ¯X(1) 0 , . . . , ¯X(n) 0 from q (e.g., a database of natural images), we train a neural network on the empirical sco re matching objective ( 2.7), see [ SE19]. Let h > 0 be the step size of the discretization; we assume that we have obt ained a score estimate skh of ∇ ln qkh for each time k = 0 , 1, . . . , N , where T = Nh. In order to approximately implement the reverse SDE ( 2.4), we ﬁrst replace the score function ∇ ln qT −t with the estimate sT −t. Then, for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h] we freeze the value of this coeﬃcient in the SDE at time kh. It yields the new SDE dX← t = {X← t + 2 sT −kh(X← kh)} dt + √ 2 dBt , t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h] . (2.8) Since this is a linear SDE, it can be integrated in closed form; in particula r, conditionally on X← kh, the next iterate X← (k+1)h has an explicit Gaussian distribution. There is one ﬁnal detail: although the reverse SDE ( 2.4) should be started at qT , we do not have access to qT directly. Instead, taking advantage of the fact that qT ≈ γd, we instead initialize the algorithm at X← 0 ∼ γd, i.e., from pure noise. Let pt := law( X← t ) denote the law of the algorithm at time t. The goal of this work is to bound TV(pT , q ), taking into account three sources of error: (1) the estimation of the score function; (2) the discretization of the SDE with step size h > 0; and (3) the initialization of the algorithm at γd rather than at qT . 52.2 Background on the critically damped Langevin diﬀusion ( CLD) The critically damped Langevin diﬀusion (CLD) is based on the forward process d ¯Xt = − ¯Vt dt , d ¯Vt = −( ¯Xt + 2 ¯Vt) dt + 2 d Bt . (2.9) Compared to the OU process ( 2.1), this is now a coupled system of SDEs, where we have introduced a n ew variable ¯V representing the velocity process. The stationary distribution of the process is γ 2d, the standard Gaussian measure on phase space Rd × Rd, and we initialize at ¯X0 ∼ q and ¯V0 ∼ γd. More generally, the CLD ( 2.9) is an instance of what is referred to as the kinetic Langevin or the under- damped Langevin process in the sampling literature. In the context of log-concave s ampling, the smoother paths of ¯X leads to smaller discretization error, thereby furnishing an algorith m with ˜O( √ d/ε ) gradient com- plexity (as opposed to sampling based on the overdamped Langevin p rocess, which has complexity ˜O(d/ε 2)), see [ Che+18; SL19; DR20; Ma+21]. In the recent paper [ DVK22], Dockhorn, Vahdat, and Kreis proposed to use the CLD as the basis for an SGM and they empirically observed im provements over DDPM. Applying ( 2.3), the corresponding reverse process is d ¯X← t = − ¯V ← t dt , d ¯V ← t = ( ¯X← t + 2 ¯V ← t + 4 ∇v ln qT −t( ¯X← t , ¯V ← t ) ) dt + 2 d Bt , (2.10) where qt := law( ¯Xt, ¯Vt) is the law of the forward process at time t. Note that the gradient in the score function is only taken w.r.t. the velocity coordinate. Upon replacing t he score function with an estimate s, we arrive at the algorithm dX← t = −V ← t dt , dV ← t = ( X← t + 2 V ← t + 4 sT −kh(X← kh, V ← kh ) ) dt + 2 d Bt , for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h]. We provide further background on the CLD in Section 6.1. 3 Results We now state our assumptions and our main results. 3.1 Results for DDPM For DDPM, we make the following mild assumptions on the data distribut ion q. Assumption 1 (Lipschitz score) . For all t ≥ 0, the score ∇ ln qt is L-Lipschitz. Assumption 2 (second moment bound) . We assume that m2 2 := Eq[∥·∥2] < ∞. Assumption 1 is standard and has been used in the prior works [ BMR22; LLT22]. However, unlike [ LLT22], we do not assume Lipschitzness of the score estimate. Moreover, unlike [ De +21 ; BMR22], we do not assume any convexity or dissipativity assumptions on the potential U, and unlike [ LLT22] we do not assume that q satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality. Hence, our assumptions cover a w ide range of highly non-log-concave data distributions. Our proof technique is fairly robust and even Assump tion 1 could be relaxed (as well as other extensions, such as considering the time-changed forward proce ss ( 2.2)), although we focus on the simplest setting in order to better illustrate the conceptual signiﬁcance of our results. We also assume a bound on the score estimation error. Assumption 3 (score estimation error) . For all k = 1 , . . . , N , Eqkh [∥skh − ∇ ln qkh∥2] ≤ ε2 score . This is the same assumption as in [ LLT22], and as discussed in Section 2.1, it is a natural and realistic assumption in light of the derivation of the score matching objective . Our main result for DDPM is the following theorem. 6Theorem 2 (DDPM). Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold. Let pT be the output of the DDPM algorithm (Section 2.1) at time T , and suppose that the step size h := T/N satisﬁes h ≲ 1/L , where L ≥ 1. Then, it holds that TV(pT , q ) ≲ √ KL(q ∥ γd) exp(−T )    convergence of forward process + ( L √ dh + Lm2h) √ T   discretization error + εscore √ T   score estimation error . Proof. See Section 5. To interpret this result, suppose that KL(q ∥ γd) ≤ poly(d) and m2 ≤ d. Choosing T ≍ log(KL(q ∥ γd)/ε ) and h ≍ ε2 L2d , and hiding logarithmic factors, TV(pT , q ) ≤ ˜O(ε + εscore) , for N = ˜Θ ( L2d ε2 ) . In particular, in order to have TV(pT , q ) ≤ ε, it suﬃces to have score error εscore ≤ ˜O(ε). We remark that the iteration complexity of N = ˜Θ( L2d ε2 ) matches state-of-the-art complexity bounds for the Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm for sampling under a log-So bolev inequality (LSI), see [ VW19; Che+21a]. This provides some evidence that our discretization bounds are of the correct order, at least with respect to the dimension and accuracy parameters, and without h igher-order smoothness assumptions. 3.2 Consequences for arbitrary data distributions with bou nded support We now elaborate upon the implications of our results under the sole assumption that the data distribution q is compactly supported, supp q ⊆ B(0, R ). In particular, we do not assume that q has a smooth density w.r.t. Lebesgue measure, which allows for studying the case when q is supported on a lower-dimensional submanifold of Rd as in the manifold hypothesis . This setting was investigated recently in [ De 22 ]. For this setting, our results do not apply directly because the scor e function of q is not well-deﬁned and hence Assumption 1 fails to hold. Also, the bound in Theorem 2 has a term involving KL(q ∥ γd) which is inﬁnite if q is not absolutely continuous w.r.t. γd. As pointed out by [ De 22 ], in general we cannot obtain non-trivial guarantees for TV(pT , q ), because pT has full support and therefore TV(pT , q ) = 1 under the manifold hypothesis. Nevertheless, we show that we can apply our r esults using an early stopping technique. Namely, consider qt the law of the OU process at a time t > 0, initialized at q. Then, we show in Lemma 20 that, if t ≍ ε2 W2 / ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)) where 0 < ε W2 ≪ √ d, then qt satisﬁes Assumption 1 with L ≲ dR2 (R ∨ √ d) 2 /ε 4 W2 , KL(qt ∥ γd) ≤ poly(R, d, 1/ε ), and W2(qt, q ) ≤ εW2 . By substituting q by qt into the result of Theorem 2, we obtain Corollary 3 below. Taking qt as the new target corresponds to stopping the algorithm early: ins tead of running the algorithm backward for a time T , we run the algorithm backward for a time T − t (note that T − t should be a multiple of the step size h). Corollary 3 (compactly supported data) . Suppose that q is supported on the ball of radius R ≥ 1. Let t ≍ ε2 W2 / ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)). Then, the output pT −t of DDPM is εTV-close in TV to the distribution qt, which is εW2 -close in W2 to q, provided that the step size h is chosen appropriately according to Theorem 2 and N = ˜Θ ( d3R4 (R ∨ √ d) 4 ε2 TV ε8 W2 ) and εscore ≤ ˜O(εTV) . Observing that both the TV and W1 metrics are upper bounds for the bounded Lipschitz metric dBL(µ, ν ) := sup { ∫ f dµ − ∫ f dν ⏐ ⏐ f : Rd → [−1, 1] is 1-Lipschitz }, we immediately obtain the following corollary. Corollary 4 (compactly supported data, BL metric) . Suppose that q is supported on the ball of radius R ≥ 1. Let t ≍ ε2/ ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)). Then, the output pT −t of the DDPM algorithm satisﬁes dBL(pT −t, q ) ≤ ε, provided that the step size h is chosen appropriately according to Theorem 2 and N = ˜Θ( d3R4 (R∨ √ d)4/ε 10) and εscore ≤ ˜O(ε). 7Finally, if the output pT −t of DDPM at time T − t is projected onto B(0, R 0) for an appropriate choice of R0, then we can also translate our guarantees to the standard W2 metric, which we state as the following corollary. Corollary 5 (compactly supported data, W2 metric; see Section 5.5). Suppose that q is supported on the ball of radius R ≥ 1. Let t ≍ ε2/ ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)), and let pT −t,R0 denote the output of DDPM at time T − t projected onto B(0, R 0) for R0 = ˜Θ( R). Then, it holds that W2(pT −t,R0 , q ) ≤ ε, provided that the step size h is chosen appropriately according to Theorem 2, N = ˜Θ( d3R8 (R ∨ √ d)4/ε 12), and εscore ≤ ˜O(ε). Note that the dependencies in the three corollaries above are polyn omial in all of the relevant problem parameters. In particular, since the last corollary holds in the W2 metric, it is directly comparable to [ De 22 ] and vastly improves upon the exponential dependencies therein. 3.3 Results for CLD In order to state our results for score-based generative modelin g based on the CLD, we must ﬁrst modify Assumptions 1 and 3 accordingly. Assumption 4. For all t ≥ 0, the score ∇v ln qt is L-Lipschitz. Assumption 5. For all k = 1 , . . . , N , Eqkh [∥skh − ∇v ln qkh∥2] ≤ ε2 score . If we ignore the dependence on L and assume that the score estimate is suﬃciently accurate, then t he iteration complexity guarantee of Theorem 2 is N = ˜Θ( d/ε 2). On the other hand, recall from Section 2.2 that based on intuition from the literature on log-concave sampling a nd from empirical ﬁndings in [ DVK22], we might expect that SGMs based on the CLD have a smaller iteration c omplexity than DDPM. We prove the following theorem. Theorem 6 (CLD). Suppose that Assumptions 2, 4, and 5 hold. Let pT be the output of the SGM algorithm based on the CLD (Section 2.2) at time T , and suppose that the step size h := T/N satisﬁes h ≲ 1/L , where L ≥ 1. Then, there is a universal constant c > 0 such that TV(pT , q ⊗ γd) ≲ √ KL(q ∥ γd) + FI(q ∥ γd) exp(−cT )    convergence of forward process + ( L √ dh + Lm2h) √ T   discretization error + εscore √ T   score estimation error where FI(q ∥ γd) is the relative Fisher information FI(q ∥ γd) := Eq[∥∇ ln(q/γ d)∥2]. Proof. See Section 6. Note that the result of Theorem 6 is in fact no better than our guarantee for DDPM in Theorem 2. Although it is possible that this is an artefact of our analysis, we believ e that it is in fact fundamental. As we discuss in Remark 6.2, from the form of the reverse process ( 2.10), the SGM based on CLD lacks a certain property (that the discretization error should only depend on the size of the increment of the X process, not the increments of both the X and V processes) which is crucial for the improved dimension dependence of the CLD over the Langevin diﬀusion in log-concave sampling. Hence, in general, we conjecture that under our assumptions, SGMs based on the CLD do not achieve a better dim ension dependence than DDPM. We provide evidence for our conjecture via a lower bound. In our pr oofs of Theorems 2 and 6, we rely on bounding the KL divergence between certain measures on the pa th space C([0, T ]; Rd) via Girsanov’s theorem. The following result lower bounds this KL divergence, even for the setting in which the score estimate is perfect ( εscore = 0) and the data distribution q is the standard Gaussian. Theorem 7. Let pT be the output of the SGM algorithm based on the CLD (Section 2.2) at time T , where the data distribution q is the standard Gaussian γd, and the score estimate is exact ( εscore = 0 ). Suppose that the step size h satisﬁes h ≤ 1 10 . Then, for the path measures P T and Q← T of the algorithm and the continuous-time process ( 2.10) respectively (see Section 6 for details), it holds that KL(Q← T ∥ P T ) ≥ dhT . 8Proof. See Section 6.5. Theorem 7 shows that in order to make the KL divergence between the path me asures small, we must take h ≲ 1/d , which leads to an iteration complexity that scales linearly in the dimens ion d. Theorem 7 is not a proof that SGMs based on the CLD cannot achieve better tha n linear dimension dependence, as it is possible that the output pT of the SGM is close to q ⊗ γd even if the path measures are not close, but it rules out the possibility of obtaining a better dimension dependence via our Girsanov-based proof technique. We believe that it provides compelling evidence for our conjecture, i.e., t hat under our assumptions, the CLD does not improve the complexity of SGMs over DDPM. We remark that in this section, we have only considered the error ar ising from discretization of the SDE. It is possible that the score function for the SGM with the CLD is easie r to estimate than the score function for DDPM, providing a statistical beneﬁt of using the CLD. Indeed, under the manifold hypothesis, t he score ∇ ln qt for DDPM blows up at t = 0, but the score ∇v ln qt for CLD is well-deﬁned at t = 0, and hence may lead to improvements over DDPM. We do not investigate this ques tion here and leave it as future work. 4 Technical overview We now give a detailed technical overview for the proof for DDPM (Th eorem 2). The proof for CLD (Theorem 6) follows along similar lines. Recall that we must deal with three sources of error: (1) the est imation of the score function; (2) the discretization of the SDE; and (3) the initialization of the reverse pr ocess at γd rather than at qT . First, we ignore the errors (1) and (2), and focus on the error (3 ). Hence, we consider the continuous-time reverse SDE ( 2.4), initialized from either γd or from qT . Let the law of the two processes at time t be denoted ˜pt and qT −t respectively; how fast do these laws diverge away from each other ? The two main ways to study Markov diﬀusions is via the 2-Wasserstein distance W2, or via information divergences such as the KL divergence or the χ 2 divergence. In order for the reverse process to be contractive in the W2 distance, one typically needs some form of log-concavity assumptio n for the data distribution q. For example, if ∇ ln q(x) = −x/σ 2 (i.e., q ∼ normal(0, σ 2Id)), then for the reverse process ( 2.4) we have d ¯X← T = { ¯X← T + 2 ∇ ln q( ¯X← T )} dt + √ 2 dBt = ( 1 − 2 σ2 ) ¯X← T dt + √ 2 dBt . For σ2 ≫ 1, the coeﬃcient in front of ¯X← T is positive; this shows that for times near T , the reverse process is actually expansive, rather than contractive. This poses an obstacle for an analysis in W2. Although it is possible to perform a W2 analysis using a weaker condition, such as a dissipativity condition, it t ypically leads to exponential dependence on the problem parameters (e.g., [De 22 ]). On the other hand, the situation is diﬀerent for an information diver gence d. By the data-processing inequality, we always have d(qT −t, ˜pt) ≤ d(qT , ˜p0) = d(qT , γ d) . This motivates studying the processes via information divergences . We remark that the convergence of reversed SDEs has been studied in the context of log-concave sam pling in [ Che+22b] for the proximal sampler algorithm [ LST21], providing the intuition behind these observations. Next, we consider the score estimation error (1) and the discretiz ation error (2). In order to perform a dis- cretization analysis in KL or χ 2, there are two salient proof techniques. The ﬁrst is the interpolat ion method of [ VW19] (originally for KL divergence, but extended to χ 2 divergence in [ Che+21a]), which is the method used in [ LLT22]. The interpolation method writes down a diﬀerential inequality for ∂td(qT −t, p t), which is used to bound d(qT −(k+1)h, p (k+1)h) in terms of d(qT −kh, p kh) and an additional error term. Unfortunately, the analysis of [ LLT22] required taking d to be the χ 2 divergence, for which the interpolation method is quite delicate. In particular, the error term is bounded using a log-S obolev assumption on q, see [ Che+21a] for further discussion. Instead, we pursue the second approac h, which is to apply Girsanov’s theorem from stochastic calculus and to instead bound the divergence between m easures on path space; this turns out to 9be doable using standard techniques. This is because, as noted in [ Che+21a], the Girsanov approach is more ﬂexible as it requires less stringent assumptions. 2 To elaborate, the main diﬃculty of using the interpolation method with an L2-accurate score estimate (Assumption 3) is that the score estimation error is controlled by assumption unde r the law of the true process ( 2.4), but the interpolation analysis requires a control of the score es timation error under the law of the algorithm (2.8). Consequently, the work of [ LLT22] required an involved change of measure argument in order to relate the errors under the two processes. In contras t, the Girsanov approach allows us to directly work with the score estimation error under the true process ( 2.4). Notation Stochastic processes and their laws. • The data distribution is q = q0. • The forward process ( 2.1) is denoted ( ¯Xt)t∈[0,T ], and ¯Xt ∼ qt. • The reverse process ( 2.4) is denoted ( ¯X← t )t∈[0,T ], where ¯X← t := ¯XT −t ∼ qT −t. • The SGM algorithm ( 2.8) is denoted ( X← t )t∈[0,T ], and X← t ∼ pt. Recall that we initialize at p0 = γd, the standard Gaussian measure. • The process ( X←,qT t )t∈[0,T ] is the same as ( X← t )t∈[0,T ], except that we initialize this process at qT rather than at γd. We write X←,qT t ∼ pqT t . Conventions for Girsanov’s theorem. When we apply Girsanov’s theorem, it is convenient to instead think about a single stochastic process, which for ease of notation we denote simply via ( Xt)t∈[0,T ], and we consider diﬀerent measures over the path space C([0, T ]; Rd). The three measures we consider over path space are: • Q← T , under which ( Xt)t∈[0,T ] has the law of the reverse process ( 2.4); • P qT T , under which ( Xt)t∈[0,T ] has the law of the SGM algorithm initialized at qT (corresponding to the process ( X←,qT t )t∈[0,T ] deﬁned above). We also use the following notion from stochastic calculus [ Le 16 , Deﬁnition 4.6]: • A local martingale ( Lt)t∈[0,T ] is a stochastic process s.t. there exists a sequence of nondecrea sing stopping times Tn → T s.t. Ln = ( Lt∧Tn )t∈[0,T ] is a martingale. Other parameters. We recall that T > 0 denotes the total time for which we run the forward process; h > 0 is the step size of the discretization; L ≥ 1 is the Lipschitz constant of the score function; m2 2 := Eq[∥·∥2] is the second moment under the data distribution; and εscore is the L2 score estimation error. Notation for CLD. The notational conventions for the CLD are similar; however, we mu st also consider a velocity variable V . When discussing quantities which involve both position and velocity (e .g., the joint distribution qt of ( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)), we typically use boldface fonts. 5 Proofs for DDPM 5.1 Preliminaries on Girsanov’s theorem and a ﬁrst attempt a t applying Gir- sanov’s theorem First, we recall a consequence of Girsanov’s theorem that can be o btained by combining Pages 136–139, Theorem 5.22, and Theorem 4.13 of [ Le 16 ]. 2After the ﬁrst draft of this work was made available online, w e became aware of the concurrent and independent work of [ Liu+22] which also uses an approach based on Girsanov’s theorem. 10Theorem 8. For t ∈ [0, T ], let Lt = ∫ t 0 bs dBs where B is a Q-Brownian motion. Assume EQ ∫ T 0 ∥bs∥2 ds < ∞. Then, L is a Q-martingale in L2(Q). Moreover, if EQ E(L)T = 1 , where E(L)t := exp ( ∫ t 0 bs dBs − 1 2 ∫ t 0 ∥bs∥2 ds ) , (5.1) then E(L) is also a Q-martingale and the process t ↦→Bt − ∫ t 0 bs ds is a Brownian motion under P := E(L)T Q, the probability distribution with density E(L)T w.r.t. Q. If the assumptions of Girsanov’s theorem are satisﬁed (i.e., the condition ( 5.1)), we can apply Girsanov’s theorem to Q = Q← T and bt = √ 2 (sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)) , where t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h]. This tells us that under P = E(L)T Q← T , there exists a Brownian motion ( βt)t∈[0,T ] s.t. dBt = √ 2 (sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)) dt + dβt . (5.2) Recall that under Q← T we have a.s. dXt = {Xt + 2 ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)} dt + √ 2 dBt , X 0 ∼ qT . (5.3) The equation above still holds P -a.s. since P ≪ Q← T (even if B is no longer a P -Brownian motion). Plugging ( 5.2) into ( 5.3) we have P -a.s.,3 dXt = {Xt + 2 sT −kh(Xkh)} dt + √ 2 dβt , X 0 ∼ qT . In other words, under P , the distribution of X is the SGM algorithm started at qT , i.e., P = P qT T = E(L)T Q← T . Therefore, KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) = EQ← T ln dQ← T dP qT T = EQ← T ln E(L)−1 T (5.4) = N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 dt , where we used EQ← T Lt = 0 because L is a martingale. The equality ( 5.4) allows us to bound the discrepancy between the SGM algorithm and t he reverse process. 5.2 Checking the assumptions of Girsanov’s theorem and the G irsanov dis- cretization argument In most applications of Girsanov’s theorem in sampling, a suﬃcient con dition for ( 5.1) to hold, known as Novikov’s condition, is satisﬁed. Here, Novikov’s condition writes EQ← T exp ( N−1∑ k=0 ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 dt ) < ∞ , and if Novikov’s condition holds, we can apply Girsanov’s theorem direc tly. However, under Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 alone, Novikov’s condition need not hold. Indeed, in order to check N ovikov’s condition, we would want X0 to have sub-Gaussian tails for instance. 3We still have X0 ∼ qT under P because the marginal at time t = 0 of P is equal to the marginal at time t = 0 of Q← T . That is a consequence of the fact that E(L) is a (true) Q← T -martingale. 11Furthermore, we also could not check that the condition ( 5.1), which is weaker than Novikov’s condition, holds. Therefore, in the proof of the next Theorem, we use a appr oximation technique to show that KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) = EQ← T ln dQ← T dP qT T ≤ EQ← T ln E(L)−1 T (5.5) = N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 dt . We then use a discretization argument based on stochastic calculus to further bound this quantity. The result is the following theorem. Theorem 9 (discretization error for DDPM) . Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold. Let Q← T and P qT T denote the measures on path space corresponding to the rever se process ( 2.4) and the SGM algorithm with L2-accurate score estimate initialized at qT . Assume that L ≥ 1 and h ≲ 1/L . Then, TV(P qT T , Q ← T )2 ≤ KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T . Proof. We start by proving N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 dt ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T . Then, we give the approximation argument to prove the inequality ( 5.5). Bound on the discretization error. For t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h], we can decompose EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2] ≲ EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −kh(Xkh)∥2] + EQ← T [∥∇ ln qT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xkh)∥2] + EQ← T [∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + EQ← T [   ∇ ln qT −kh qT −t (Xkh)    2] + L2 EQ← T [∥Xkh − Xt∥2] . (5.6) We must bound the change in the score function along the forward p rocess. If S : Rd → Rd is the mapping S(x) := exp( −(t − kh)) x, then qT −kh = S#qT −t ∗ normal(0, 1 − exp(−2 (t − kh))). We can then use [ LLT22, Lemma C.12] (or the more general Lemma 16 that we prove in Section 6.4) with α = exp( t − kh) = 1 + O(h) and σ2 = 1 − exp(−2 (t − kh)) = O(h) to obtain   ∇ ln qT −kh qT −t (Xkh)    2 ≲ L2dh + L2h2 ∥Xkh∥2 + (1 + L2) h2 ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh)∥2 ≲ L2dh + L2h2 ∥Xkh∥2 + L2h2 ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh)∥2 where the last line uses L ≥ 1. For the last term, ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh)∥2 ≲ ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 + ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 ≲ ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2 + L2 ∥Xkh − Xt∥2 , where the second term above is absorbed into the third term of the decomposition ( 5.6). Hence, EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2h2 EQ← T [∥Xkh∥2] + L2h2 EQ← T [∥∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2] + L2 EQ← T [∥Xkh − Xt∥2] . 12Using the fact that under Q← T , the process ( Xt)t∈[0,T ] is the time reversal of the forward process ( ¯Xt)t∈[0,T ], we can apply the moment bounds in Lemma 10 and the movement bound in Lemma 11 to obtain EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2h2 (d + m2 2) + L3dh2 + L2 (m2 2h2 + dh) ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2 . Approximation argument. For t ∈ [0, T ], let Lt = ∫ t 0 bs dBs where B is a Q← T -Brownian motion and we deﬁne bt = √ 2 {sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)} , for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1) h]. We proved that EQ← T ∫ T 0 ∥bs∥2 ds ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T < ∞. Using [ Le 16 , Proposition 5.11], ( E(L)t)t∈[0,T ] is a local martingale. Therefore, there exists a non-decreasing se quence of stopping times Tn ր T s.t. (E(L)t∧Tn )t∈[0,t] is a martingale. Note that E(L)t∧Tn = E(Ln)t where Ln t = Lt∧Tn . Since E(Ln) is a martingale, we have EQ← T E(Ln)T = EQ← T E(Ln)0 = 1 , i.e., EQ← T E(L)Tn = 1. We apply Girsanov’s theorem to Ln t = ∫ t 0 bs /BD [0,Tn](s) dBs, where B is a Q← T -Brownian motion. Since EQ← T ∫ T 0 ∥bs /BD [0,Tn](s)∥2 ds ≤ EQ← T ∫ T 0 ∥bs∥2 ds < ∞ (see the last paragraph) and EQ← T E(Ln)T = 1, we obtain that under P n := E(Ln)T Q← T there exists a Brownian motion βn s.t. for t ∈ [0, T ], dBt = √ 2 {sT −kh(Xkh) − ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)} /BD [0,Tn](t) dt + dβn t . Recall that under Q← T we have a.s. dXt = {Xt + 2 ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)} dt + √ 2 dBt , X 0 ∼ qT . The equation above still holds P n-a.s. since P n ≪ Q← T . Combining the last two equations we then obtain P n-a.s., dXt = {Xt + 2 sT −kh(Xkh)} /BD [0,Tn](t) dt + {Xt + 2 ∇ ln qT −t(Xt)} /BD [Tn,T ](t) dt + √ 2 dβn t , (5.7) and X0 ∼ qT . In other words, P n is the law of the solution of the SDE ( 5.7). At this stage we have the bound KL(Q← T ∥ P n) = EQ← T ln E(L)−1 Tn = EQ← T [ −LTn + 1 2 ∫ Tn 0 ∥bs∥2 ds ] = EQ← T 12 ∫ Tn 0 ∥bs∥2 ds ≤ EQ← T 12 ∫ T 0 ∥bs∥2 ds ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T , where we used that EQ← T LTn = 0 because L is a Q← T -martingale and Tn is a bounded stopping time [ Le 16 , Corollary 3.23]. Our goal is now to show that we can obtain the ﬁnal re sult by an approximation argument. We consider a coupling of ( P n)n∈N, P qT T : a sequence of stochastic processes ( Xn)n∈N over the same probability space, a stochastic process X and a single Brownian motion W over that space s.t. 4 dXn t = {Xn t + 2 sT −kh(Xn kh)} /BD [0,Tn](t) dt + {Xn t + 2 ∇ ln qT −t(Xn t )} /BD [Tn,T ](t) dt + √ 2 dWt , and dXt = {Xt + 2 sT −kh(Xn kh)} dt + √ 2 dWt , with X0 = Xn 0 a.s. and X0 ∼ qT . Note that the distribution of Xn (resp. X) is P n (resp. P qT T ). 4Such a coupling always exists, see [ Le 16 , Corollary 8.5]. 13Let ε > 0 and consider the map πε : C([0, T ]; Rd) → C ([0, T ]; Rd) deﬁned by πε(ω )(t) := ω (t ∧ T − ε) . Noting that Xn t = Xt for every t ∈ [0, T n] and using Lemma 12, we have πε(Xn) → πε(X) a.s., uniformly over [0 , T ]. Therefore, πε#P n → πε#P qT T weakly. Using the lower semicontinuity of the KL divergence and the data-processing inequality [ AGS05, Lemma 9.4.3 and Lemma 9.4.5], we obtain KL((πε)#Q← T ∥ (πε)#P qT T ) ≤ lim inf n→∞ KL((πε)#Q← T ∥ (πε)#P n) ≤ lim inf n→∞ KL(Q← T ∥ P n) ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T . Finally, using Lemma 13, πε(ω ) → ω as ε → 0, uniformly over [0 , T ]. Therefore, using [ AGS05, Corollary 9.4.6], KL((πε)#Q← T ∥ (πε)#P qT T ) → KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) as ε ց 0. Therefore, KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T . We conclude with Pinsker’s inequality ( TV2 ≤ KL). 5.3 Proof of Theorem 2 We can now conclude our main result. Proof. [Proof of Theorem 2] We recall the notation from Section 4. By the data processing inequality, TV(pT , q ) ≤ TV(PT , P qT T ) + TV(P qT T , Q ← T ) ≤ TV(qT , γ d) + TV(P qT T , Q ← T ) . Using the convergence of the OU process in KL divergence [see, e.g., BGL14, Theorem 5.2.1] and applying Theorem 9 for the second term, TV(pT , q ) ≲ √ KL(q ∥ γd) exp(−T ) + ( εscore + L √ dh + Lm2h) √ T , which proves the result. 5.4 Auxiliary lemmas In this section, we prove some auxiliary lemmas which are used in the pr oof of Theorem 2. Lemma 10 (moment bounds for DDPM) . Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Let ( ¯Xt)t∈[0,T ] denote the forward process (2.1). 1. (moment bound) For all t ≥ 0, E[∥ ¯Xt∥2] ≤ d ∨ m2 2 . 2. (score function bound) For all t ≥ 0, E[∥∇ ln qt( ¯Xt)∥2] ≤ Ld . Proof. 1. Along the OU process, we have ¯Xt d = exp( −t) ¯X0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) ξ, where ξ ∼ normal(0, I d) is independent of ¯X0. Hence, E[∥ ¯Xt∥2] = exp( −2t) E[∥X∥2] + {1 − exp(−2t)} d ≤ d ∨ m2 2 . 142. This follows from the L-smoothness of ln qt [see, e.g., VW19, Lemma 9]. We give a short proof for the sake of completeness. If Ltf := ∆ f − ⟨∇Ut, ∇f⟩ is the generator associated with qt ∝ exp(−Ut), then 0 = Eqt LtUt = Eqt ∆ Ut − Eqt [∥∇Ut∥2] ≤ Ld − Eqt [∥∇Ut∥2] . Lemma 11 (movement bound for DDPM) . Suppose that Assumption 2 holds. Let ( ¯Xt)t∈[0,T ] denote the forward process (2.1). For 0 ≤ s < t with δ := t − s, if δ ≤ 1, then E[∥ ¯Xt − ¯Xs∥2] ≲ δ2m2 2 + δd . Proof. We can write E[∥ ¯Xt − ¯Xs∥2] = E [   − ∫ t s ¯Xr dr + √ 2 (Bt − Bs)    2] ≲ δ ∫ t s E[∥ ¯Xr∥2] dr + δd ≲ δ2 (d + m2 2) + δd ≲ δ2m2 2 + δd , where we used Lemma 10. We omit the proofs of the two next lemmas as they are straightforw ard. Lemma 12. Consider fn, f : [0 , T ] → Rd s.t. there exists an increasing sequence (Tn)n∈N ⊆ [0, T ] satisfying the conditions • Tn → T as n → ∞ , • fn(t) = f(t) for every t ≤ Tn. Then, for every ε > 0, fn → f uniformly over [0, T − ε]. In particular, fn(· ∧ T − ε) → f(· ∧ T − ε) uniformly over [0, T ]. Lemma 13. Consider f : [0 , T ] → Rd continuous, and fε : [0 , T ] → Rd s.t. fε(t) = f(t ∧ (T − ε)) for ε > 0. Then fε → f uniformly over [0, T ] as ε → 0. 5.5 Proof of Corollary 5 Proof. [Proof of Corollary 5] For R0 > 0, let Π R0 denote the projection onto B(0, R 0). We want to prove that W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, q ) ≤ ε. We use the decomposition W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, q ) ≤ W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, (Π R0 )#qt) + W2((Π R0 )#qt, q ) . For the ﬁrst term, since (Π R0 )#pT −t and (Π R0 )#qt both have support contained in B(0, R 0), we can upper bound the Wasserstein distance by the total variation distance. N amely, [Rol22, Lemma 9] implies that W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, (Π R0 )#qt) ≲ R0 √ TV((Π R0 )#pT −t, (Π R0 )#qt) + R0 exp(−R0) . By the data-processing inequality, TV((Π R0 )#pT −t, (Π R0 )#qt) ≤ TV(pT −t, q t) ≤ εTV , where εTV is from Corollary 3, yielding W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, (Π R0 )#qt) ≲ R0 √εTV + R0 exp(−R0) . 15Next, we take R0 ≥ R so that (Π R0 )#q = q. Since Π R0 is 1-Lipschitz, we have W2((Π R0 )#qt, q ) = W2((Π R0 )#qt, (Π R0 )#q) ≤ W2(qt, q ) ≤ εW2 , where εW2 is from Corollary 3. Combining these bounds, W2((Π R0 )#pT −t, q ) ≲ R0 √εTV + R0 exp(−R0) + εW2 . We now take εW2 = ε/ 3, R0 = ˜Θ( R), and εTV = ˜Θ( ε2/R 2) to obtain the desired result. The iteration complexity follows from Corollary 3. 6 Proofs for CLD 6.1 Background on the CLD process More generally, for the forward process we can introduce a friction parameter γ > 0 and consider d ¯Xt = ¯Vt dt , d ¯Vt = − ¯Xt dt − γ ¯Vt dt + √ 2γ dBt . If we write ¯θt := ( ¯Xt, ¯Vt), then the forward process satisﬁes the linear SDE d¯θt = Aγ ¯θt dt + Σ γ dBt , where Aγ := [ 0 1 −1 −γ ] and Σ γ := [ 0√2γ ] . The solution to the SDE is given by ¯θt = exp( tAγ ) ¯θ0 + ∫ t 0 exp{(t − s) Aγ } Σ γ dBs , (6.1) which means that by the Itˆ o isometry, law(¯θt) = exp( tAγ)# law(¯θ0) ∗ normal ( 0, ∫ t 0 exp{(t − s) Aγ} Σ γΣ T γ exp{(t − s) AT γ } ds ) . Since det Aγ = 1, Aγ is always invertible. Moreover, from tr Aγ = −γ, one can work out that the spectrum of Aγ is spec(Aγ ) = { − γ 2 ± √ γ2 4 − 1 } . However, Aγ is not diagonalizable. The case of γ = 2 is special, as it corresponds to the case when the spectrum is {−1}, and it corresponds to the critically damped case . Following [ DVK22], which advocated for setting γ = 2, we will also only consider the critically damped case. This also has th e advantage of substantially simplifying the calculations. 6.2 Girsanov discretization argument In order to apply Girsanov’s theorem, we introduce the path measu res P qT T and Q← T , under which dXt = −Vt dt , dVt = {Xt + 2 Vt + 4 sT −kh(Xkh, V kh)} dt + 2 d Bt , for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h], and dXt = −Vt dt , dVt = {Xt + 2 Vt + 4 ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)} dt + 2 d Bt , respectively. Applying Girsanov’s theorem, we have the following theorem. 16Corollary 14. Suppose that Novikov’s condition holds: EQ← T exp ( 2 N−1∑ k=0 ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 dt ) < ∞ . Then, KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) = EQ← T ln dQ← T dP qT T = 2 N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 dt . Similarly to Appendix 5.2, even if Novikov’s condition does not hold, one can use an approximat ion to argue that the KL divergence is still upper bounded by the last expr ession. Since the argument follows along the same lines, we omit it for brevity. Using this, we now aim to prove the following theorem. Theorem 15 (discretization error for CLD) . Suppose that Assumptions 2, 4, and 5 hold. Let Q← T and P qT T denote the measures on path space corresponding to the rever se process ( 2.10) and the SGM algorithm with L2-accurate score estimate initialized at qT . Assume that L ≥ 1 and h ≲ 1/L . Then, TV(P qT T , Q← T )2 ≤ KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) ≲ (ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2) T . Proof. For t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h], we can decompose EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2] ≲ EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −kh(Xkh, V kh)∥2] + EQ← T [∥∇v ln qT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xkh, V kh)∥2] + EQ← T [∥∇v ln qT −t(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + EQ← T [   ∇v ln qT −kh qT −t (Xkh, V kh)    2] + L2 EQ← T [∥(Xkh, V kh) − (Xt, V t)∥2] . (6.2) The change in the score function is bounded by Lemma 16, which generalizes [ LLT22, Lemma C.12]. From the representation ( 6.1) of the solution to the CLD, we note that qT −kh = ( M0)#qT −t ∗ normal(0, M1) with M0 = exp ( (t − kh) A2 ) , M1 = ∫ t−kh 0 exp{(t − kh − s) A2} Σ 2Σ T 2 exp{(t − kh − s) AT 2 } ds . In particular, since ∥A2∥op ≲ 1, ∥A−1 2 ∥op ≲ 1, and ∥Σ 2∥op ≲ 1 it follows that ∥M0∥op = 1 + O(h) and ∥M1∥op = O(h). Substituting this into Lemma 16, we deduce that if h ≲ 1/L , then   ∇v ln qT −kh qT −t (Xkh, V kh)    2 ≤   ∇ ln qT −kh qT −t (Xkh, V kh)    2 ≲ L2dh + L2h2 (∥Xkh∥2 + ∥Vkh∥2) + (1 + L2) h2 ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh, V kh)∥2 ≲ L2dh + L2h2 (∥Xkh∥2 + ∥Vkh∥2) + L2h2 ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh, V kh)∥2 , where in the last step we used L ≥ 1. 17For the last term, ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xkh, V kh)∥2 ≲ ∥∇ ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 + L2 ∥(Xkh, V kh) − (Xt, V t)∥2 , where the second term above is absorbed into the third term of the decomposition ( 6.2). Hence, EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2h2 EQ← T [∥Xkh∥2 + ∥Vkh∥2] + L2h2 EQ← T [∥∇ ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2] + L2 EQ← T [∥(Xkh, V kh) − (Xt, V t)∥2] . By applying the moment bounds in Lemma 17 together with Lemma 18 on the movement of the CLD process, we obtain EQ← T [∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2] ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2h2 (d + m2 2) + L3dh2 + L2 (dh + m2 2h2) ≲ ε2 score + L2dh + L2m2 2h2 . The proof is concluded via an approximation argument as in Section 5.2. Remark. We now pause to discuss why the discretization bound above does no t improve upon the result for DDPM (Theorem 9). In the context of log-concave sampling, one instead considers t he underdamped Langevin process dXt = Vt , dVt = −∇U(Xt) dt − γ Vt dt + √ 2γ dBt , which is discretized to yield the algorithm dXt = Vt , dVt = −∇U(Xkh) dt − γ Vt dt + √ 2γ dBt , for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1) h]. Let P T denote the path measure for the algorithm, and let QT denote the path measure for the continuous-time process. After applying Girsano v’s theorem, we obtain KL(QT ∥ P T ) ≍ 1 γ N−1∑ k=0 EQT ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥∇U(Xt) − ∇U(Xkh)∥2 dt . In this expression, note that ∇U depends only on the position coordinate. Since the X process is smoother (as we do not add Brownian motion directly to X), the error ∥∇U(Xt)− ∇U(Xkh)∥2 is of size O(dh2), which allows us to take step size h ≲ 1/ √ d. This explains why the use of the underdamped Langevin diﬀusion leads to improved dimension dependence for log-concave sampling. In contrast, consider the reverse process, in which KL(Q← T ∥ P qT T ) = 2 N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 dt . Since discretization of the reverse process involves the score fun ction, which depends on both X and V , the error now involves controlling ∥Vt − Vkh∥2, which is of size O(dh) (the process V is not very smooth because it includes a Brownian motion component). Therefore, from the for m of the reverse process, we may expect that SGMs based on the CLD do not improve upon the dimension depen dence of DDPM. In Section 6.5, we use this observation in order to prove a rigorous lower bound ag ainst discretization of SGMs based on the CLD. 186.3 Proof of Theorem 6 Proof. [Proof of Theorem 6] By the data processing inequality, TV(pT , q0) ≤ TV(P T , P qT T ) + TV(P qT T , Q← T ) ≤ TV(qT , γ 2d) + TV(P qT T , Q← T ) . In [ Ma+21], following the entropic hypocoercivity approach of [ Vil09], Ma et al. consider a Lyapunov func- tional L which is equivalent to the sum of the KL divergence and the Fisher info rmation, L(µ ∥ γ 2d) ≍ KL(µ ∥ γ 2d) + FI(µ ∥ γ 2d) , which decays exponentially fast in time: there exists a universal con stant c > 0 such that for all t ≥ 0, L(qt ∥ γ 2d) ≤ exp(−ct) L(q0 ∥ γ 2d) . Since q0 = q ⊗ γd and γ 2d = γd ⊗ γd, then L(q0 ∥ γ 2d) ≲ KL(q ∥ γd) + FI(q ∥ γd). By Pinsker’s inequality and Theorem 15, we deduce that TV(pT , q0) ≲ √ KL(q ∥ γd) + FI(q ∥ γd) exp(−cT ) + ( εscore + L √ dh + Lm2h) √ T , which completes the proof. 6.4 Auxiliary lemmas We begin with the perturbation lemma for the score function. Lemma 16 (score perturbation lemma) . Let 0 < ζ < 1. Suppose that M0, M1 ∈ R2d×2d are two matrices, where M1 is symmetric. Also, assume that ∥M0 − I2d∥op ≤ ζ, so that M0 is invertible. Let q = exp( −H) be a probability density on R2d such that ∇H is L-Lipschitz with L ≤ 1 4 ∥M1∥op . Then, it holds that   ∇ ln (M0)#q ∗ normal(0, M1) q (θ)    ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + Lζ ∥θ∥ + (ζ + L ∥M1∥op) ∥∇H(θ)∥ . Proof. The proof follows along the lines of [ LLT22, Lemma C.12]. First, we show that when M0 = I2d, if L ≤ 1 2 ∥M1∥op then   ∇ ln q ∗ normal(0, M1) q (θ)    ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + L ∥M1∥op ∥∇H(θ)∥ . (6.3) Let S denote the subspace S := range M1. Then, since ( q ∗ normal(0, M1) ) (θ) = ∫ θ +S exp ( − 1 2 ⟨θ − θ′, M−1 1 (θ − θ′)⟩ ) q(dθ′) , where M−1 1 is well-deﬁned on S, we have   ∇ ln q ∗ normal(0, M1) q (θ)    =    ∫ θ +S∇H(θ′) exp(− 1 2 ⟨θ − θ′, M−1 1 (θ − θ′)⟩) q(dθ′)∫ θ +Sexp(− 1 2 ⟨θ − θ′, M−1 1 (θ − θ′)⟩) q(dθ′) − ∇H(θ)    = ∥Eqθ ∇H − ∇H(θ)∥ . Here, qθ is the measure on θ + S such that qθ (dθ′) ∝ exp ( − 1 2 ⟨θ − θ′, M−1 1 (θ − θ′)⟩ ) q(dθ′) . Note that since L ≤ 1 2 ∥M1∥op , then if we write qθ (θ′) ∝ exp(−Hθ (θ′)), we have ∇2Hθ ⪰ ( 1 ∥M1∥op − L ) Id ⪰ 1 2 ∥M1∥op Id on θ + S . 19Let θ⋆ ∈ arg min Hθ denote a mode. We bound ∥Eqθ ∇H − ∇H(θ)∥ ≤ L Eθ ′∼qθ ∥θ′− θ∥ ≤ L Eθ ′∼qθ ∥θ′− θ⋆∥ + L ∥θ⋆ − θ∥ . For the ﬁrst term, [ DKR22, Proposition 2] yields Eθ ′∼qθ ∥θ′− θ⋆∥ ≤ √ 2 ∥M1∥op d . For the second term, since the mode satisﬁes ∇H(θ⋆) + M−1 1 (θ⋆ − θ) = 0, we have ∥θ⋆ − θ∥ ≤ ∥ M1∥op ∥∇H(θ⋆)∥ ≤ L ∥M1∥op ∥θ⋆ − θ∥ + ∥M1∥op ∥∇H(θ)∥ which is rearranged to yield ∥θ⋆ − θ∥ ≤ 2 ∥M1∥op ∥∇H(θ)∥ . After combining the bounds, we obtain the claimed estimate ( 6.3). Next, we consider the case of general M0. We have   ∇ ln (M0)#q ∗ normal(0, M1) q (θ)    ≤   ∇ ln (M0)#q ∗ normal(0, M1) (M0)#q (θ)    +   ∇ ln (M0)#q q (θ)   . We can apply ( 6.3) with ( M0)#q in place of q, noting that ( M0)#q ∝ exp(−H′) for H′:= H ◦ M0 which is L′-smooth for L′:= L ∥M0∥2 op ≲ L, to get   ∇ ln (M0)#q ∗ normal(0, M1) (M0)#q (θ)    ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + L ∥M1∥op ∥M0∇H(M0θ)∥ ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + L ∥M1∥op ∥∇H(M0θ)∥ . Note that ∥∇H(M0θ)∥ ≤ ∥∇ H(θ)∥ + L ∥(M0 − I2d) θ∥ ≲ ∥∇H(θ)∥ + Lζ ∥θ∥ . We also have   ∇ ln (M0)#q q (θ)    = ∥M0∇H(M0θ) − ∇H(θ)∥ ≤ ∥ M0∇H(M0θ) − M0∇H(θ)∥ + ∥M0∇H(θ) − ∇H(θ)∥ ≲ L ∥(M0 − I2d) θ∥ + ζ ∥∇H(θ)∥ ≲ Lζ ∥θ∥ + ζ ∥∇H(θ)∥ . Combining the bounds,   ∇ ln (M0)#q ∗ normal(0, M1) q (θ)    ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + Lζ (1 + L ∥M1∥op) ∥θ∥ + (ζ + L ∥M1∥op) ∥∇H(θ)∥ ≲ L √ ∥M1∥op d + Lζ ∥θ∥ + (ζ + L ∥M1∥op) ∥∇H(θ)∥ so the lemma follows. Next, we prove the moment and movement bounds for the CLD. Lemma 17 (moment bounds for CLD) . Suppose that Assumptions 2 and 4 hold. Let ( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)t∈[0,T ] denote the forward process (2.9). 1. (moment bound) For all t ≥ 0, E[∥( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)∥2] ≲ d + m2 2 . 202. (score function bound) For all t ≥ 0, E[∥∇ ln qt( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)∥2] ≤ Ld . Proof. 1. We can write E[∥( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)∥2] = W 2 2 (qt, δ 0) ≲ W 2 2 (qt, γ 2d) + W 2 2 (γ 2d, δ 0) ≲ d + W 2 2 (qt, γ 2d) . Next, the coupling argument of [ Che+18] shows that the CLD converges exponentially fast in the Wasserstein metric associated to a twisted norm |||·|||which is equivalent (up to universal constants) to the Euclidean norm ∥·∥. It implies the following result, see, e.g., [ Che+18, Lemma 8]: W 2 2 (qt, γ 2d) ≲ W 2 2 (q, γ 2d) ≲ W 2 2 (q, δ 0) + W 2 2 (δ0, γ 2d) ≲ d + m2 2 . 2. The proof is the same as in Lemma 10. Lemma 18 (movement bound for CLD) . Suppose that Assumptions 2 holds. Let ( ¯Xt, ¯Vt)t∈[0,T ] denote the forward process (2.9). For 0 < s < t with δ := t − s, if δ ≤ 1, E[∥( ¯Xt, ¯Vt) − ( ¯Xs, ¯Vs)∥2] ≲ δ2m2 2 + δd . Proof. First, E[∥ ¯Xt − ¯Xs∥2] = E [    ∫ t s ¯Vr dr    2] ≤ δ ∫ t s E[∥ ¯Vr∥2] dr ≲ δ2 (d + m2 2) , where we used the moment bound in Lemma 17. Next, E[∥ ¯Vt − ¯Vs∥2] = E [    ∫ t s (− ¯Xr − 2 ¯Vr) dr + 2 ( Bt − Bs)    2] ≲ δ ∫ t s E[∥ ¯Xr∥2 + ∥ ¯Vr∥2] dr + δd ≲ δ2 (d + m2 2) + δd , where we used Lemma 17 again. 6.5 Lower bound against CLD When proving upper bounds on the KL divergence, we can use the ap proximation argument described in Section 5.2 in order to invoke Girsanov’s theorem. However, when proving lower bounds on the KL divergence, this approach no longer works, so we check Novikov’s condition direc tly for the setting of Theorem 7. Lemma 19 (Novikov’s condition holds for CLD) . Consider the setting of Theorem 7. Then, Novikov’s condition 14 holds. We defer the proof of Lemma 19 to the end of this section. Admitting Lemma 19, we now prove Theorem 7. Proof. [Proof of Theorem 7] Since q0 = γd ⊗ γd = γ 2d is stationary for the forward process ( 2.9), we have qt = γ 2d for all t ≥ 0. In this proof, since the score estimate is perfect and qT = γ 2d, we simply denote the path measure for the algorithm as P T = P qT T . From Girsanov’s theorem in the form of Corollary 14 and from sT −kh(x, v ) = ∇v ln qT −kh(x, v ) = −v, we have KL(Q← T ∥ P T ) = 2 N−1∑ k=0 EQ← T ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥Vkh − Vt∥2 dt . (6.4) 21To lower bound this quantity, we use the inequality ∥x + y∥2 ≥ 1 2 ∥x∥2 − ∥y∥2 to write, for t ∈ [kh, (k + 1)h] EQ← T [∥Vkh − Vt∥2] = E[∥ ¯VT −kh − ¯VT −t∥2] = E [    ∫ T −kh T −t {− ¯Xs − 2 ¯Vs} ds + 2 ( BT −kh − BT −t)    2] ≥ 2 E[∥BT −kh − BT −t∥2] − E [    ∫ T −kh T −t {− ¯Xs − 2 ¯Vs} ds    2] ≥ 2d (t − kh) − (t − kh) ∫ T −kh T −t E[∥ ¯Xs + 2 ¯Vs∥2] ds ≥ 2d (t − kh) − (t − kh) ∫ T −kh T −t E[2 ∥ ¯Xs∥2 + 8 ∥ ¯Vs∥2] ds . Using the fact that ¯Xs ∼ γd and ¯Vs ∼ γd for all s ∈ [0, T ], we can then bound EQ← T [∥Vkh − Vt∥2] ≥ 2d (t − kh) − 10d (t − kh)2 ≥ d (t − kh) , provided that h ≤ 1 10 . Substituting this into ( 6.4), KL(Q← T ∥ P T ) ≥ 2d N−1∑ k=0 ∫ (k+1)h kh (t − kh)2 dt = dh2N = dhT . This proves the result. This lower bound shows that the Girsanov discretization argument o f Theorem 15 is essentially tight (except possibly the dependence on L). We now prove Lemma 19. Proof. [Proof of Lemma 19] Similarly to the proof of Theorem 7 above, we note that ∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 = ∥ ¯VT −kh − ¯VT −t∥2 =    ∫ T −kh T −t {− ¯Xs − 2 ¯Vs} ds + 2 ( BT −kh − BT −t)    2 ≲ h2 sup s∈[0,T ] (∥ ¯Xs∥2 + ∥ ¯Vs∥2) + sup s∈[T −(k+1)h,T −kh] ∥BT −kh − Bs∥2 . Hence, for a universal constant C > 0 (which may change from line to line) EQ← T exp ( 2 N−1∑ k=0 ∫ (k+1)h kh ∥sT −kh(Xkh, V kh) − ∇v ln qT −t(Xt, V t)∥2 dt ) ≤ E exp ( CT h2 sup s∈[0,T ] (∥ ¯Xs∥2 + ∥ ¯Vs∥2) + Ch N−1∑ k=0 sup s∈[T −(k+1)h,T −kh] ∥BT −kh − Bs∥2 ) . By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, to prove that this expectation is ﬁnite, it suﬃces to consider the two terms in the exponential separately. Next, we recall that d ¯Xt = ¯Vt dt , d ¯Vt = −( ¯Xt + 2 ¯Vt) dt + 2 d Bt . Deﬁne ¯Yt := ¯Xt + ¯Vt. Then, d ¯Yt = − ¯Yt dt + 2 d Bt, which admits the explicit solution ¯Yt = exp( −t) ¯Y0 + 2 ∫ t 0 exp{−(t − s)} dBs . 22Also, d ¯Xt = − ¯Xt dt + ¯Yt dt, which admits the solution ¯Xt = exp( −t) ¯X0 + ∫ t 0 exp{−(t − s)} ¯Yt dt . Hence, ∥ ¯Xt∥ + ∥ ¯Vt∥ ≤ 2 ∥ ¯Xt∥ + ∥ ¯Yt∥ ≲ ∥ ¯X0∥ + sup s∈[0,T ] ∥ ¯Ys∥ and sup t∈[0,T ] ∥ ¯Yt∥ ≲ ∥ ¯X0∥ + ∥ ¯V0∥ + sup t∈[0,T ] { exp(−t)    ∫ t 0 exp(s) dBs    } = ∥ ¯X0∥ + ∥ ¯V0∥ + sup t∈[0,T ] exp(−t) ∥ ˜B(exp(2t)−1)/2∥ where ˜B is another standard Brownian motion and we use the interpretation of stochastic integrals as time changes of Brownian motion [ Ste01, Corollary 7.1]. Since ( ¯X0, ¯V0) ∼ γ 2d has independent entries, then E exp(CT h2 {∥ ¯X0∥2 + ∥ ¯V0∥2}) = d∏ j=1 E exp(CT h2 ⟨ej , ¯X0⟩2) E exp(CT h2 ⟨ej , ¯V0⟩2) < ∞ provided that h ≲ 1/ √ T . Also, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we can give a crude bound : writing τ(t) = (exp(2 t) − 1)/ 2, E exp ( CT h2 sup t∈[0,T ] exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 ) ≤ [ E exp ( 2CT h2 sup t∈[0,1] exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 )] 1/2 × [ E exp ( 2CT h2 sup t∈[1,T ] exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 )] 1/2 where, by standard estimates on the supremum of Brownian motion [see, e.g., Che+21b, Lemma 23], the ﬁrst factor is ﬁnite if h ≲ 1/ √ T (again using independence across the dimensions). For the second factor, if we split the sum according to exp( −2t) ≍ 2k and use H¨ older’s inequality, E exp ( CT h2 sup t∈[1,T ] exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 ) ≤ K∏ k=1 [ E exp ( CKT h 2 sup 2k≤t≤2k+1 exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 )] 1/K where K = O(T ). Then, E exp ( CT 2h2 sup 2k≤t≤2k+1 exp(−2t) ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 ) ≤ E exp ( CT 2h22−k sup 1≤t≤2k+1 ∥ ˜Bτ (t)∥2 ) < ∞ , provided h ≲ 1/T , where we again use [ Che+21b, Lemma 23] and split across the coordinates. The Cauchy– Schwarz inequality then implies E exp ( CT h2 sup s∈[0,T ] (∥ ¯Xs∥2 + ∥ ¯Vs∥2) ) < ∞ . 23For the second term, by independence of the increments, E exp ( Ch N−1∑ k=0 sup s∈[T −(k+1)h,T −kh] ∥BT −kh − Bs∥2 ) = N−1∏ k=0 E exp ( Ch sup s∈[T −(k+1)h,T −kh] ∥BT −kh − Bs∥2 ) = [ E exp ( Ch sup s∈[0,h] ∥Bs∥2 )] N . By [ Che+21b, Lemma 23], this quantity is ﬁnite if h ≲ 1, which completes the proof. 7 Conclusion In this work, we provided the ﬁrst convergence guarantees for S GMs which hold under realistic assumptions (namely, L2-accurate score estimation and arbitrarily non-log-concave data distributions) and which scale polynomially in the problem parameters. Our results take a step towa rds explaining the remarkable empirical success of SGMs, at least under the assumption that the score fu nction is learned with small L2 error. The main limitation of this work is that we did not address the question o f when the score function can be learned well. In general, studying the non-convex training dynam ics of learning the score function via neural networks is challenging, but we believe that the resolution of this problem, even for simple learning tasks, would shed considerable light on SGMs. Together with the res ults in this paper, it would yield the ﬁrst end-to-end guarantees for SGMs. In another direction, and in light of the interpretation of our result as a reduction of the task of sampling to the task of score function estimation, we ask whether there ar e situations of interest in which it is easier to algorithmically learn the score function (not necessarily via a neural network) than it is to (directly) sample.

See also [ Hyv05; Vin11; SE19]. Recall that the problem is to solve minimize st∈F Eqt [∥st − ∇ ln qt∥2] . This objective cannot be evaluated, even if we replace the expecta tion over qt with an empirical average over samples from qt. The trick is to use an integration by parts identity to reformulate t he objective. Here, C will denote any constant that does not depend on the optimization v ariable st. Expanding the square, Eqt [∥st − ∇ ln qt∥2] = Eqt [∥st∥2 − 2 ⟨st, ∇ ln qt⟩] + C . We can rewrite the second term using integration by parts: ∫ ⟨st, ∇ ln qt⟩dqt = ∫ ⟨st, ∇qt⟩ = − ∫ (div st) dqt = − ∫∫ (div st) ( exp(−t) x0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) zt ) dq(x0) dγd(zt) , where γd = normal(0, I d) and we used the explicit form of the law of the OU process at time t. Recall the Gaussian integration by parts identity: for any vector ﬁeld v : Rd → Rd, ∫ (div v) dγd = ∫ ⟨x, v (x)⟩dγd(x) . Applying this identity, ∫ ⟨st, ∇ ln qt⟩dqt = − 1√ 1 − exp(−2t) ∫ ⟨zt, s t(xt)⟩dq(x0) dγd(zt) where xt = exp( −t) x0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) zt. Substituting this in, Eqt [∥st − ∇ ln qt∥2] = E [ ∥st(Xt)∥2 + 2√ 1 − exp(−2t) ⟨Zt, s t(Xt)⟩ ] + C = E [   s(Xt) + 1 √ 1 − exp(−2t) Zt    2] + C , where X0 ∼ q and Zt ∼ γd are independent, and Xt := exp( −t) X0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) Zt. B Regularization Lemma 20. Suppose that supp q ⊆ B(0, R ) where R ≥ 1, and let qt denote the law of the OU process at time t, started at q. Let ε > 0 be such that ε ≪ √ d and set t ≍ ε2/ ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)). Then, 1. W2(qt, q ) ≤ ε. 2. qt satisﬁes KL(qt ∥ γd) ≲ √ d (R ∨ √ d) 3 ε2 . 3. For every t′≥ t, qt′ satisﬁes Assumption 1 with L ≲ dR2 (R ∨ √ d) 2 ε4 . 25Proof. 1. For the OU process ( 2.1), we have ¯Xt := exp( −t) ¯X0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) Z, where Z ∼ normal(0, I d) is independent of ¯X0. Hence, for t ≲ 1, W 2 2 (q, q t) ≤ E [  ( 1 − exp(−t) ) ¯X0 + √ 1 − exp(−2t) Z  2] = ( 1 − exp(−t) ) 2 E[∥ ¯X0∥2] + ( 1 − exp(−2t) ) d ≲ R2t2 + dt . We now take t ≲ min{ε/R, ε 2/d } to ensure that W 2 2 (q, q t) ≤ ε2. Since ε ≪ √ d, it suﬃces to take t ≍ ε2/ ( √ d (R ∨ √ d)). 2. For this, we use the short-time regularization result in [ OV01, Corollary 2], which implies that KL(qt ∥ γd) ≤ W 2 2 (q, γ d) 4t ≲ W 2 2 (q, δ 0) + W 2 2 (γd, δ 0) t ≲ √ d (R ∨ √ d) 3 ε2 . 3. Using [ MS22, Lemma 4], along the OU process, 1 1 − exp(−2t) Id − exp(−2t) R2 (1 − exp(−2t))2 Id ≼ −∇2 ln qt(x) ≼ 1 1 − exp(−2t) Id . With our choice of t, it implies ∥∇2 ln qt′∥op ≲ 1 1 − exp(−2t′) ∨ exp(−2t′) R2 (1 − exp(−2t′))2 ≲ 1 t ∨ R2 t2 ≲ dR2 (R ∨ √ d) 2 ε4 . References [AGS05] L. Ambrosio, N. Gigli, and G. Savar´ e.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing the first convergence results for diffusion models in this setting. In particular, we provide quantitative bounds on the Wasserstein distance of order one between the target data distribution and the generative distribution of the diffusion model. 1 Introduction Diffusion modeling, also called score-based generative modeling, is a new paradigm for generative modeling which exhibits state-of-the-art performance in image and audio synthesis (Song and Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021b; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). Such models first consider a forward stochastic process, adding noise to the data until a Gaussian distribution is reached. The model then approximates the backward process associated with this forward noising process. It can be shown, see (Haussmann and Pardoux, 1986) for instance, that in order to compute the drift of the backward trajectory, the gradient of the forward logarithmic density (Stein score) must be estimated. Such an estimator is then obtained using score matching techniques (Hyvärinen, 2005; Vincent, 2011) and leveraging neural network techniques. At sampling time, the backward process is initialized with a Gaussian and run backward in time using the approximation of the Stein score. Despite impressive empirical results, theoretical understanding and convergence analysis of diffusion models remain limited. De Bortoli et al. (2021b) establish the convergence of diffusion models in total variation under the assumption that the target distribution admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure and under dissipativity conditions. More recently Lee et al. (2022) obtained convergence results for diffusion models, including predictor-corrector schemes, under the assumption that the target distribution admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure and satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality. However, these works implicitly assume that the score does not explode ast→0, by imposing that the score of the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous or satisfies some growth property. This is not observed in practice and experimentally the norm of the score blows up whent→0, see (Kim et al., 2022) for instance. Indeed, the assumptions that the target distribution admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure and has a Lipschitz logarithmic gradient does not hold if one assumes themanifold hypothesis(Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Fefferman et al., 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2022) or if the target measure is an empirical measure. In this setting, the target distribution is supported on a lower dimensional compact set. In the case of image processing, this hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence (Weinberger and Saul, 1 arXiv:2208.05314v2  [stat.ML]  29 May 2023Under review as submission to TMLR 2006; Fefferman et al., 2016). Under this hypothesis, even though the forward process admits a density for all t> 0 its logarithmic gradient explodes for smallt→0. Consequently, previous theoretical analyses of diffusion models do not apply to this setting. To our knowledge, (Pidstrigach, 2022) is the only existing work investigating the convergence of diffusion models under such manifold assumptions by showing that the limit of the continuous backward process with approximate score is well-defined and that its distribution is equivalent to the one of the target distribution under integrability conditions on the error of the score. In particular, Pidstrigach (2022) show that these distributions have the same support. In this work, we complement these results and study the convergence rate of diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. More precisely, we derive quantitative convergence bounds in Wasserstein distance of order one between the target distribution and the generative distribution of the diffusion model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the basics of diffusion models. We present our main results and discuss links with the existing literature in Section 3. The rest of the paper is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 1 in Section 4. We conclude and explore future avenues in Section 5. 2 Diffusion models for generative modeling In this section, we recall the basics of diffusion models. Henceforth, letπ ∈P(Rd) denote the target distribution, also known as the data distribution, andπ∞= N(0,Id) the d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. In what follows, we letT >0 and consider the forward noising process(Xt)t∈[0,T] given by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck1 process as follows dXt = −βtXtdt+ √ 2βtdBt, X0 ∼π. (1) where (Bt)t≥0 is ad-dimensional Brownian motion andt↦→βt is a (positive) weight function. In practice, setting β0 ≤βT allows for better control of the backward diffusion near the target distribution, see (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021; Song et al., 2021b) for instance. In what follows, we assume that(1) admits a strong solution. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution (Haussmann and Pardoux, 1986; Cattiaux et al., 2021), the backward process(Yt)t∈[0,T] = (XT−t)t∈[0,T] satisfies dYt = βT−t{Yt + 2∇log pT−t(Yt)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, (2) where {pt}t∈(0,T] the family of densities of{L(Xt)}t∈(0,T] 2 w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. In order to define (2) we do not need to assume thatπ admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. In practice, instead of sampling fromY0 ∼L(XT) we sample fromY0 ∼π∞= N(0,Id). For largeT >0 the mismatch between the distribution ofXT and π∞is small due to geometric convergence of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. In practice, {∇log pt}t∈[0,T] cannot be computed exactly and is approximated by a family of estimators {s(t,·)}t∈[0,T]. Those estimators minimize the denoising score matching loss functionℓ given by ℓ(s) = ∫T 0 ϕ(t)E[∥s(t,Xt) −∇log pt|0(Xt|X0)∥2]dt, (3) with pt|0 is the density ofXt given X0, i.e. the density of the transition kernel associated with(1) and ϕ: [0,T] →R+ is a weighting function. In practice,(3) is approximated using Monte Carlo samples and the loss function is minimized over the parameters of a neural network. Once the score estimatorsis learned, we introduce a continuous-time backward process( ˆYt)t∈[0,T] approxi- mating (Yt)t∈[0,T] and given by d ˆYt = βT−t{ˆYt + 2s(T −t, ˆYt)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, ˆY0 ∼π∞= N(0,Id). (4) In practice, one needs to discretize(4) in order to define an algorithm which can be implemented. We consider a sequence of stepsizes{γk}k∈{0,...,K}such that∑K k=0 γk = T. In what follows, for anyk ∈{0,...,K }we 1Also called Variance Preserving Stochastic Differential Equation (VPSDE) in Song et al. (2021b). 2For anyRd-valued random variableX, L(X) is the distribution ofX. 2Under review as submission to TMLR denote tk+1 = ∑k j=0 γj and t0 = 03. Given this sequence of stepsizes, we consider the interpolation process ( ¯Yt)t∈[0,T] defined for anyk∈{0,...,K }and t∈[tk,tk+1] by d ¯Yt = βT−t{¯Yt + 2s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, ¯Y0 ∼π∞. This process is an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process on the interval[tk,tk+1]. Denoting (Yk)k∈{0,...,K+1}such that for anyk∈{0,...,K + 1}, Yk = ¯Ytk, we have for anyk∈{0,...,K } Yk+1 = Yk + γ1,k(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + √2γ2,kZk, (5) γ1,k = exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1, γ 2,k = (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)/2. where {Zk}k∈N is a sequence of independentd-dimensional Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. The discretization(5) approximately corresponds to the discrete-time scheme introduced in (Ho et al., 2020), see Appendix B.2. We call this discretization scheme theexponential integrator (EI) discretization, similarly to Zhang and Chen (2022) who introduced a similar scheme in accelerated deterministic diffusion models. Lee et al. (2022) analyze a slightly different scheme corresponding to replacing βT−t¯Yt by βT−t¯Ytk in (4). We summarize the processes we have introduced in Table 1 and discuss the links between(5) and the classical Euler–Maruyama discretization in Appendix B.1. As emphasized in the Description Evolution equation Forward process dXt = −βtXtdt+ √2βtdBt Backward process (BP) dYt = βT−t{Yt + 2∇log pT−t(Yt)}dt+ √2βT−tdBt Score approximate BP (SBP) d ˆYt = βT−t{ˆYt + 2s(T −t, ˆYt)}dt+ √2βT−tdBt EI interpolation of SBP d ¯Yt = βT−t{¯Yt + 2s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)}dt+ √2βT−tdBt EI discretization of SBP Yk+1 = Yk + γ1,k(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + √2γ2,kZk Table 1:Different processes considered in this paper. introduction, under the manifold hypothesis or in the case where the target distribution is an empirical measure, the true score∇log pt explodes whent→0. This behavior has been observed in practice for image synthesis (Kim et al., 2022; Song and Ermon, 2020). One way to deal with this explosive behavior is to truncate the integration of the backward diffusion,i.e. instead of running(Yt)t∈[0,T] we consider(Yt)t∈[0,T−ε] for a small hyperparameterε> 0, (Vahdat et al., 2021; Song and Ermon, 2020). Translating this condition on the associated discretized process, we assume thattK = T −ε and study{Yk}k∈{0,...,K}by disregarding the last sampleYK+1. We note that versions of diffusion models defined in discrete time do not suffer from such shortcomings as the truncation is embedded in the discretization scheme, see (Song et al., 2021b; Song and Ermon, 2020; 2019; Ho et al., 2020) for instance. Recently Kim et al. (2022) have proposed a soft probabilistic truncation to replace the proposed hard threshold. 3 Main results We first start by introducing and discussing our main assumptions. The only assumption we consider on the data distributionπ is that it is supported on a compact setM⊂ Rd (i.e. a bounded and closed subset ofRd). A1. π is supported on a compact setMand 0 ∈M. The assumption0 ∈M can be omitted but is kept to simplify the proofs. We denotediam(M) the diameter of the manifold defined bydiam(M) = sup{∥x−y∥: x,y ∈M}. An assumption of compactness is natural in image processing as images are encoded on a finite range (typically [0,255] for each channel). We emphasize that this assumption encompasses not only all distributions which admit a continuous density on a lower dimensional manifold but also all empirical densities of the form (1/N) ∑N i=1 δXi. Next, we turn to the temperature schedulet↦→βt and make the following assumption. 3Note thattK+1 = T. 3Under review as submission to TMLR A2. t↦→βt is continuous, non-decreasing and there exists¯β >0 such that for anyt∈[0,T], 1/¯β ≤βt ≤¯β. Under this assumption, the integral oft↦→βt is well-defined and for anyt∈[0,T] we have that Xt = mtX0 + σtZ, m t = exp[− ∫t 0 βsds], σ 2 t = 1 −exp[−2 ∫t 0 βsds], where the first equality holds in distribution andZ is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and identity covariance. Note thatA2 is satisfied for every schedule used in practice, see Appendix G. Finally, we make the following assumption on the score network. A3. There exists∈C([0,T] ×Rd,Rd) and M ≥0 such that for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd, ∥s(t,xt) −∇log pt(xt)∥≤ M(1 + ∥xt∥)/σ2 t. Contrary to De Bortoli et al. (2021b), we do not assume a uniform bound in time and space as we allow growth as t →0 and ∥x∥→ 0. This assumption is more realistic as∥∇log pt(xt)∥∼t→0 c0(xt)/σ2 t and ∥∇log pt(xt)∥∼∥xt∥→+∞ c1(t)∥xt∥as we will show in Appendix C. This explosive behavior ast →0 is accounted for in practical implementations. For example Song et al. (2021b) used a parameterization of the score of the forms(t,x) = n(t,x)/σt, where n is a neural network with learnable parameters. Our assumption is notably different from the one of Lee et al. (2022) which assume a uniform in timeL2 bound between the score estimator and the true score. Nevertheless, in Appendix I we derive Theorem I.1 which is the counterpart to our main result under aL2 error assumption, using the theory of Lee et al. (2022) to derive anL∞error from aL2 one. However ourL2 error bounds are weaker than the ones of Lee et al. (2022) as they are estimated w.r.t. to the distribution of thealgorithm and not w.r.t. the true backward distribution. We highlight thatL2 bounds are more realistic thanL∞as the score is estimated on the data. Finally, we make the following assumption on the sequence of stepsizes. Recall that for anyk∈{0,...,N } we havetk+1 = ∑k j=0 γj and t0 = 0. A4. For anyk∈{0,...,K −1}, we haveγksupv∈[T−tk+1,T−tk] βv/σ2 v ≤δ≤1/2. In the case whereβt = β0 for anyt∈[0,T], A4 is implied by the following condition: for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} γk(β0 + (2∑K j=k+1 γj)−1) ≤δ. (6) In the next section, we fixγK = ε and in this case, the condition (6) is satisfied ifγk ≤δε/(2 + β0ε). 3.1 Convergence bounds We are now ready to state our main result. Theorem 1.Assume A1, A2, A3, A4 that T ≥2 ¯β(1 +log(1 +diam(M)), γK = ε and ε,M,δ ≤1/32. Then, there existsD0 ≥0 such that W1(L(YK),π) ≤D0(exp[κ/ε](M + δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε1/2), with κ= diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/2 and D0 = D(1 + ¯β)7(1 + d+ diam(M)4)(1 + log(1 + diam(M))), (7) and D is a numerical constant. First, we note that lettingT →+∞, δ,M →0 and then ε →0 we get thatW1(L(YK),π) →0. This consequence is to be expected sincelimε→0 L(YT−ε) = π. An explicit dependency of the bound on these parameters is given in Corollary 2. More generally the error bound depends on four variables (a)ε which corresponds to the truncation of the backward process, (b)T the integration time of the forward process, (c) δ which is related to a condition on the stepsizes of the backward discretization, seeA4 (d) M which controls the score approximation, seeA3. The dependence w.r.t.δ1/2 and M is linear, whereas the dependence w.r.t. T is of the formexp[−T/¯β]. These two terms are multiplied by a quantity depending on the truncation 4Under review as submission to TMLR bound ε which is exponential of the formexp[κ/ε]. We conjecture that under additional assumptions on Mthis dependence can be improved to also be polynomial, see Theorem 3 for an extension of Theorem 1 under general Hessian assumptions. Additional remarks and comments on Theorem 1 and its assumptions are considered in Appendix F. Proof. We provide a sketch of the proof. The detailed proof is postponed to Section 4. The distribution of YK is given byπ∞RK, where RK is the transition kernel associated withYK|Y0. In order to control W1(π∞RK,π), we consider the following inequality W1(π∞RK,π) ≤W1(π∞RK,π∞QtK) + W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) + W1(πPT−tK,π), (8) where (Pt)t∈[0,T] is the semi-group associated with(Xt)t∈[0,T] and (Qt)t∈[0,T] is the semi-group associated with (Yt)t∈[0,T]. We then control each one of these terms. The first term corresponds to the discretization error and the score approximation. It is upper bounded by a term of the formO(exp[κ/ε](M + δ1/2)/ε2). The second term corresponds to the convergence of the continuous-time exact backward process and is of order O(exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β]). The last term corresponds to the error between the data distribution and a slightly noisy version of this distribution and is of orderO(ε1/2). As an immediate corollary of Theorem 1, we have the following result. Corollary 2. Assume A1, A2, A3, A4. Let η∈(0,1/32), T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)) and T ≥¯β(κ+ 1)/η2, M ≤exp[−κ/η2]η5, δ ≤exp[−2κ/η2]η10, γ K = η2. Then, W1(L(YK),π) ≤4D0η, with κ= diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/2 and D0 given in (7). The constantD0 appearing in Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 does not depend onε, T, δ and M but only on¯β, diam(M) and d. In particular, we highlight that the dependence ofD0 w.r.t. the dimension isO(d) and the dependence w.r.t. the diameter ofMis O(diam(M)4) up to logarithmic term. Note that the diameter might only depend onintrisic dimension p of Mwhich satisfiesp≪d in some settings. For example in the case of an hypercube of dimensionp we havediam(M) = √p. Contrary to De Bortoli et al. (2021b); Lee et al. (2022); Pidstrigach (2022), our results are stated w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance and not the total variation distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We emphasize that studying the total variation or Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution ofYK and the one ofπ under A1 withMlower dimensional thanRd lead tovacuous boundsas these quantities are lower bounded by1 in the case of the total variation and+∞in the case of the Kullback-Leibler divergence since the densities we are comparing are not supported on the same set.4 This is not the case with the Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge Theorem 1 is the first convergence result for diffusion models w.r.t.W1. We note that our result could be extended toWp for anyp≥1, since we do not rely on any property specific toW1 among allWp distances for anyp≥1. In particular, our analysis does not use the fact thatW1 is an integral probability metric, (Sriperumbudur et al., 2009). We conclude this section, with an improvement upon Theorem 1 in the case where tighter bounds on the Hessian ∇2 log pt are available. Theorem 3. Assume A1, A2, A3, A4 that T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)), γK = ε and ε,M,δ ≤1/32. In addition, assume that there existsΓ ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd ∥∇2 log pt(xt)∥≤ Γ/σ2 t. (9) Then, there existsD0 ≥0 such that W1(L(YK),π) ≤D0((M + δ1/2)/εΓ+2 + exp[−T/¯β]/εΓ + ε1/2), 4We emphasize however that total variation bounds smaller than1 and finite Kullback-Leibler divergence have strong implications, namely the generative model has same support as the target distribution. However, such property is not satisfied in practice, see Appendix F or (Jolicoeur-Martineau et al., 2021, Figure 2) for instance. 5Under review as submission to TMLR with D0 = D(1 + d+ (1 + diam(M))4) exp[3(1 + ¯β)2(Γ + 2)(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]. and D is a numerical constant. Proof. The complete proof is postponed to Appendix J.1. The crux of the proof is to derive an improved version of Proposition 6 which provides controls on some tangent process. Indeed, in Proposition 6, we use an upper bound of the form∥∇2 log pt(xt)∥≤ Γ/σ4 t which is a loose upper bound derived underA1. Theorem 3 improves the bounds of Theorem 1, since theexponential dependency w.r.t. ε is replaced by a polynomial dependency with exponentΓ. At first sight, it is not clear when(9) is satisfied. However, in special cases we can verify this condition explicitly. For example, in Appendix J.2, we show that this condition is satisfied ifπ is the uniform distribution on the hypercube, withp∈{1,...,d }. The condition(9) has strong geometrical implications onM. In particular, under appropriate smoothness assumptions onM, it implies thatMis convex, Appendix J.3. 3.2 Statistical guarantees and empirical measure targets We emphasize that the results of Theorem 1 hold under the general assumptionA1 which only requires the target measure to be supported on a compact set. This includes measures which are supported on a smooth manifold of dimensionp≤dbut also all empirical measures of the form(1/N) ∑N i=1 δXi with {Xi}N i=1 ∼π⊗N. In particular if we assume that the underlying target measureπ is supported on a manifold of dimension p≤d and that the diffusion models are trained w.r.t. some empirical measure associated withπ then we have the following result. Proposition 4. Assume A1, A2, A3, A4 that T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)), γK = ε and ε,M,δ ≤1/32. Then, for anyη >0 there existD0,D1 ≥0 such that E[W1(L(YK),π)] ≤D0(exp[κ/ε](M + δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε1/2) + D1N−1/(dM(M)+η), with dM(M) the Minkowski dimension ofM, see(11), κ= diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/2, D1 given in (Weed and Bach, 2019, Theorem 1) and D0 = D(1 + ¯β)7(1 + d+ diam(M)4)(1 + log(1 + diam(M))), with D a numerical constant. Proof. For anyN ∈N, we denoteπN = (1/N) ∑N i=1 δXi. Using Theorem 1, we have that for anyN ∈N W1(L(YK),πN) ≤D0(exp[κ/ε](M + δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε), with a constantD0 which does not depend on{Xi}N i=1 and N. Therefore, we have that for anyN ∈N E[W1(L(YK),πN)] ≤D0(exp[κ/ε](M + δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε). (10) Using (Weed and Bach, 2019, Theorem 1) and (Weed and Bach, 2019, Proposition 2), for anyη >0, there exists D1 ≥0 such that E[W1(πN,π)] ≤D1N−1/(dM(M)+η), which concludes the proof upon combining this result, (10) and the triangle inequality. The Minkowski dimensiond(M) is defined as follows: d(M) = d−lim infε→0 log(Vol(Mε))/log(1/ε), (11) with Vol(A) the volume of a (measurable) setA and Mε the ε-fattening ofM, i.e. for anyε >0, Mε = {x∈Rd : d(x,M) ≤ε}. For example ifMis a topological manifold of dimensionp≤d then its Minkowski dimension isp, i.e. dM(M) = p. Hence, in this case the error term in Proposition 4 dependsexponentially on 6Under review as submission to TMLR the dimension ofMand on its diameter but depends onlylinearly on d, the dimension of the ambient space. Note again thatdiam(M) might depend on the dimension ofM. For example in the case of the hypercube M= [−1/2,1/2]p, we havediam(M) = √p. Hence, the results of Proposition 4 show that diffusion models exploit the lower-dimensional structure of the target. We highlight that this result does not quantify the diversity of diffusion models,i.e. their ability to produce samples which are distinct from the ones of the training dataset Alaa et al. (2022); Zhao et al. (2018). There is empirical evidence that denoising diffusion models yield generative models with good diversity properties Xiao et al. (2021); Dhariwal and Nichol (2021) and we leave the theoretical study of the diversity of denoising diffusion models for future work. 3.3 Related works To the best of our knowledge, (De Bortoli et al., 2021b) is the first quantitative convergence results for denoising diffusion models. More precisely, De Bortoli et al. (2021b) show a bound in total variation between the distribution of the diffusion model and the target distribution of the form ∥L(YK+1) −π∥TV ≤A(exp[−T] + exp[T](M1/2 + δ1/2)). (12) This result holds under the assumption thatπ admits a density w.r.t. Lebesgue measure which satisfies some dissipativity conditions. Again we emphasize that such results in total variation are vacuous under the manifold hypothesis. The upper bound in(12) is obtained using a similar splitting of the error as in Theorem 1. However the control of the discretization error is handled using Girsanov formula in (De Bortoli et al., 2021b) and relies on similar techniques as (Dalalyan, 2017; Durmus and Moulines, 2017). In the present work, this error is controlled using the interpolation formula from Del Moral and Singh (2019) which, combined with controls on stochastic flows, allows for tighter controls of the discretization error w.r.t.W1. Lee et al. (2022) study the convergence of diffusion models under (uniform in time)L2 controls on the score approximation. Their result is given w.r.t. the total variation and therefore suffers from the same shortcoming as the ones of De Bortoli et al. (2021b). In particular it is assumed that the data distribution admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure which satisfies some regularity conditions as well as a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Additionally, it is required that∇2 log pt is bounded uniformly in time and in space which is not true under the manifold hypothesis and is hard to verify in practice even in simple cases. Closer to our line of work are the results of Pidstrigach (2022) who proves that the approximate backward process (4) converges to a random variable whose distribution is supported on the manifold of interest. In this work, we complement these results by studying the discretization scheme and providing quantitative bounds between the output of the diffusion model and the target distribution. Related to the manifold hypothesis and the study of convergence of diffusion models De Bortoli et al. (2022) study the convergence of a Riemannian counterpart of diffusion models. Result are given w.r.t. the total variation (defined on the manifold of interest). Even though such diffusion models directly incorporate the manifold information they require the knowledge of the geodesics and the Riemannian metric of the manifold. In the case of the manifold hypothesis these quantities are not known and therefore cannot be used in practice. In particular, De Bortoli et al. (2022) focus on manifolds which have a well-known structure such asS1, T2 or SO3(R). Franzese et al. (2022) show that there exists a trade-off between long and short time horizonsT. Their analysis is based on a rearrangement of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) obtained by Huang et al. (2021). This ELBO can be decomposed in the sum of two terms: one which decreases withT (controlling the bias between L(XT) and π∞) and one which increases withT (corresponding to the loss term (3)). Their decomposition of the ELBO is in fact equivalent to (Song et al., 2021a, Theorem 1). In Appendix H we include a short derivation of this result. Finally, we highlight the earlier results of Block et al. (2020a). In this work, the authors study a version of the Langevin algorithm in which the score term is approximated. This is different from the diffusion model5 setting and is closer to the setting of Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013; Arridge 5Even though the authors provide a discussion on an annealed version of the algorithm they study which corresponds to the original framework of Song and Ermon (2019). 7Under review as submission to TMLR et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Related to our manifold assumptions, Block et al. (2020b) show that in a setting similar to PnP approaches, the corresponding Langevin dynamics enjoys fast convergence rates if the target distribution is supported on a manifold with curvature assumptions. In particular, they show that a noisy version of the target distribution satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constant which only depends on the intrisic dimension of the manifold. 4 Proof of Theorem 1 In this section, we present a proof of Theorem 1. More precisely, we control each term on the right hand side of(8). The bottleneck of the proof resides in the control of the discretization and approximation error W1(π∞RK,π∞QtK) which is dealt with in Section 4.1. Then, we turn to the convergence of the backward process W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) in Section 4.2. Finally, we control the noising errorW1(πPT−tK,π) and conclude in Section 4.3. Technical results are postponed to the appendix. 4.1 Control of W1(π∞RK,π∞QtK) In this section, we controlW1(π∞RK,π∞QtK). To do so we are going to use the backward formula introduced in Del Moral and Singh (2019). First, we recall the definition of the stochastic flows(Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] and the interpolation of its discretization( ¯Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T], for anyx∈Rd and s,t ∈[0,T] with t≥s dYx s,t = βT−t{Yx s,t + 2∇log pT−t(Yx s,t)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, Yx s,s = x, and for anyk∈{0,...,K }and t∈[sk,tk+1) d ¯Yx s,t = βT−t{¯Yx s,t + 2s(T −sk, ¯Yx s,sk)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, ¯Yx s,s = x, where sk = max(s,tk). We also introduce the tangent process(Yx s,t)t∈[s,T] d∇Yx s,t = βT−t{Id +2∇2 log pT−t(Yx s,t)}∇Yx s,tdt, ∇Yx s,s = Id . (13) Note that(Yx s,t)t∈[s,T] is ad×d stochastic process. The tangent process(∇Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] can also be defined as follows. Under mild regularity assumption, for anys,t ∈[0,T] with t≥s, x↦→Yx s,t is a diffeomorphism, see (Kunita, 1981), and we denotex↦→∇Yx s,t its differential. Then, (Kunita, 1981, Section 2) shows under mild assumptions that(∇Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] satisfies (13). Hence, (∇Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] encodes the local variation of the process(Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] w.r.t. its initial condition. Our bound on the approximation/discretization error relies on the following proposition which was first proven by Del Moral and Singh (2019). Proposition 5. Assume A1. Then, for anys,t ∈[0,T) with s<t and x∈Rd Yx s,t −¯Yx s,t = ∫t s(∇Y ¯Yx s,u u,t )⊤∆bu(( ¯Yx s,v)v∈[s,T])du, where for anyu∈[0,T) with u∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈C([s,T] ,Rd) we have bu(ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2∇log pT−u(ωu)), ¯bu(ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2s(T −sk,ωsk)), ∆bu(ω) = bu(ω) −¯bu(ω). where sk = max(s,tk). Proof. The proof of this proposition is postponed to Appendix E. Using Proposition 5 our goal is now to control∥∇Yx s,t∥and ∥∆bs(( ¯Yx s,t)t∈[s,T])∥for anys,t ∈[0,T] and x ∈Rd. To do so, we introduce the timet⋆ which is a lower bound on the supremum time so that the backward process is contractive on[0,t⋆], t⋆ = T −2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))). (14) We then obtain the following bound. 8Under review as submission to TMLR Proposition 6. Assume A1 and T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Let tK ∈[0,T). Then, for anys∈[0,tK] and x∈Rd we have ∥∇Yx s,tK∥≤ exp[−(1/2) ∫T−s T−t⋆ βudu1 [0,t⋆)(s)] exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]. Proof. Let x∈Rd. First, using (13) and Lemma C.2 we have that for anys,t ∈[0,T] with s≤t d∥∇Yx s,t∥2 ≤2βT−t(∥∇Yx s,t∥2 −2(1 −m2 T−tdiam(M)2/(2σ2 T−t))/σ2 T−t∥∇Yx s,t∥2)dt. First, assume thats≤t⋆ and thatt≥t⋆. In that case, using Lemma D.8 we have that ∫t⋆ s βT−u(1 −2/σ2 T−u + m2 T−udiam(M)2/σ4 T−u)du≤−(1/2) ∫t⋆ s βT−udu. Therefore, using that result and the fact that∇Yx s,s = Id, we get that ∥∇Yx s,t⋆∥≤ exp[−(1/2) ∫T−s T−t⋆ βudu]. (15) In addition, using Lemma D.8 we have that ∫t t⋆ βT−u(1 −2/σ2 T−u + m2 T−udiam(M)2/σ4 T−u)du≤(diam(M)2/2)(σ−2 T−t −σ−2 T−t⋆). Therefore, we get that ∥∇Yx s,t∥≤ exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−t]∥∇Yx s,t⋆∥. Hence, combining this result and (15), in the case wheres≤t⋆ we have ∥∇Yx s,t∥≤ exp[−(1/2) ∫T−s T−t⋆ βsds] exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−t]. The proof in the cases wheres≥t⋆, t≥t⋆ and s≤t⋆, t≤t⋆ are similar and left to the reader. Our next goal is to control∥∆b∥. We recall thatb,¯b: [0,T] ×C([0,T] ,Rd) →Rd where for anyu∈[0,T) such thatu∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and ω= (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈C([s,T] ,Rd) 6 we have bu(ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2∇log pT−u(ωu)), ¯bu(ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2s(T −sk,ωsk)), ∆bu(ω) = bu(ω) −¯bu(ω), where sk = max(s,tk). We now provide upper bounds on∆b. We introduce the intermediate drift functions b(a),b(b),b(c),b(d) such that b(a) = b and b(d) = ¯b. In addition, for any s,u ∈[0,T) such that u ≥s, u∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and for anyω= (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈C([s,T] ,Rd) we have b(b) u (ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2∇log pT−sk(ωu)), b (c) u (ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2∇log pT−sk(ωsk)), ∆(a,b)b= b(a) −b(b), ∆(b,c)b= b(b) −b(c), ∆(c,d)b= b(c) −b(d), where sk = max(s,tk). We have that ∥∆b∥≤∥ ∆(a,b)b∥+ ∥∆(b,c)b∥+ ∥∆(c,d)b∥. (16) In the rest of this section, we control each term on the right hand side of (16). Lemma 7.For anys,u ∈[0,T) such thatu≥s, u∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and ω= (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈ C([s,T] ,Rd) we have ∥∆(a,b)bu(ω)∥≤ 2 supv∈[T−u,T−tk](β2 v/σ6 v)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥ωu∥)γk. 6With a slight abuse of notation we assume that each process onC([s,T]) is extended onC([0,T]) by settingωu = ωs for any u∈ [0,s]. 9Under review as submission to TMLR Proof. Assume thats≤tk. Then, we have ∥∆(a,b)bu(ω)∥≤ 2βT−u∥∇log pT−u(ωu) −∇log pT−tk(ωu)∥ ≤2βT−uγksupv∈[T−u,T−tk] ∥∂v∇log pT−v(ωu)∥. Using Lemma C.3, we have that ∥∆(a,b)bu(ω)∥≤ 2βT−usupv∈[T−u,T−tk](βv/σ6 v)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥ωu∥)γk, which concludes the proof in the case wheres≤tk. The case wheres≥tk is similar and left to the reader. Lemma 8.For anys,u ∈[0,T) such thatu≥s, u∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and ω= (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈ C([s,T] ,Rd) we have ∥∆(b,c)bu(ω)∥≤ 2(βT−u/σ4 T−u)(1 + diam(M)2)∥ωu −ωsk∥, where sk = max(s,tk). Proof. Assume thats≤tk. We have ∥∆(b,c)bu(ω)∥≤ 2βT−u∥∇log pT−tk(ωtk) −∇log pT−tk(ωu)∥ ≤2βT−usupv∈[u,T−tk] ∥∇2 log pT−tk(ωv)∥∥ωu −ωtk∥. Using Lemma C.2 we have that ∥∆(b,c)bu(ω)∥≤ 2(βT−u/σ4 T−u)(1 + diam(M)2)∥ωu −ωtk∥, which concludes the proof in the case wheres≤tk. The case wheres≥tk is similar and left to the reader. Finally, combining Lemma 7, Lemma 8 andA3 in(16), we get that for anys,u ∈[0,T) such thatu≥s, u∈[sk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K }and (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈C([s,T] ,Rd) we have ∥∆bu(ω)∥≤ 2 supv∈[T−tk+1,T−tk](β2 v/σ6 v)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥ωu∥)γk (17) + 2(βT−u/σ4 T−u)(1 + diam(M)2)∥ωu −ωsk∥ + 2βT−uM(1 + ∥ωsk∥)/σ2 T−u, where sk = max(s,tk). The following proposition controls the local error between the continuous-time backward process and the interpolation of the discretized one where the true score is replaced by the approximations. Proposition 9. Assume A1, A2, A3, A4. In addition, assume thatδ,M,γK ≤1/32. Then, we have for any s,u ∈[0,tK] with u≥s E[∥∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,T])∥] ≤C0(T −tK + ¯β)2(M + δ1/2)/(T −tK)2, where ¯Ys,s ∼N(0,Id) and C0 = (1 + ¯β)7/2(4 + 256d+ 43664(1 + diam(M))4). (18) Proof. Let s,u ∈[0,tK] with u≥s. In what follows, for ease of notation, we denote for anyk∈{0,...,K } κk = supv∈[T−tk+1,T−tk] βv/σ2 v. There existsk∈{0,...,K −1}such thatu∈[tk,tk+1]. Assume thats≤tk. Recall that using(17), we have that for anyω= (ωv)v∈[s,T] ∈C([s,T] ,Rd) ∥∆bu(ω)∥≤ 2 supv∈[T−tk+1,T−tk](β2 v/σ6 v)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥ωu∥)γk 10Under review as submission to TMLR + 2(βT−u/σ4 T−u)(1 + diam(M)2)∥ωu −ωtk∥ + 2βT−uM(1 + ∥ωsk∥)/σ2 T−u ≤2(κ2 k/σ2 T−tk+1 )γk(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥ωu∥) + 2κ2 k(1 + diam(M)2)∥ωu −ωtk∥/βT−u + 2κkM(1 + ∥ωsk∥). Combining this result with Lemma D.5, its following remark and Lemma D.6, we get that E[∥∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,T])∥] ≤2(κ2 k/σ2 T−tk+1 )γk(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + K1/2 0 ) + 2κ2 k(1 + diam(M)2)L1/2 0 ¯β3/2γ1/2 k + 2κkM(1 + K1/2 0 ). Denoting C = 2(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + K1/2 0 ) + 2L1/2 0 ¯β3/2(1 + diam(M)2) + 2(1 +K1/2 0 ), we get that E[∥∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,T])∥] ≤C((κ2 k/σ2 T−tk+1 )γk + κ2 kγ1/2 k + Mκk). Combining this result,A4 and Lemma D.3 we have E[∥∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,T])∥] ≤C(1 + ¯β)2(1 + ¯β/(T −tK))2(δ1/2 + M) + C(1 + ¯β)(1 + ¯β/(T −tK))(δ/σ2 T−tK) ≤C(1 + ¯β)2(T −tK + ¯β)2(δ1/2 + M)/(T −tK)2 + C(1 + ¯β)(T −tK + ¯β)(δ/σ2 T−tK)/(T −tK). Finally, using Lemma D.2, we haveσ−2 T−tK= (1 −exp[−2 ∫T−tK 0 βsds])−1 ≤1 + ¯β/(2(T −tK)) Therefore, using thatγK = T −tK <1 we get that E[∥∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,T])∥] ≤C(1 + ¯β)2(T −tK + ¯β)2(δ+ δ1/2 + M)/(T −tK)2 ≤2C(1 + ¯β)2(T −tK + ¯β)2(δ1/2 + M)/(T −tK)2 which concludes the first part of the proof in the case wheres≤tk. The same bound holds in the case where s≥tk. Finally, we conclude upon noticing that2C(1 + ¯β)2 ≤C0 with C0 given by (18). We are now ready to control the global error between the backward process and the interpolation of the associated discrete-time process where the true score has been replaced by its approximations. Proposition 10. Assume A1, A2, A3, A4 and γK = ε. In addition, assume thatε,δ,M ≤1/32. Then W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤D0 exp[diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/(2ε)](M + δ1/2)/ε2, where D0 = (1 + ¯β)7(8 + 512d+ 87328(1 + diam(M))4)(1 + log(1 + diam(M))). Proof. Using Proposition 5, we have ∥YtK −YK∥= ∥YtK −¯YtK∥≤ ∫tK 0 ∥∇Y ¯Y0,u u,tK∥∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du. Combining this result, recalling thatt⋆ is defined in (14) and Proposition 6, we get ∥YtK −YK∥≤ ∫tK 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds1 [0,t⋆)(u)] exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du ≤exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du + ∫tK t⋆ ∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du). Using this result and Proposition 9 we get W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤E[∥YtK −YK∥] ≤exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]E[∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥]du 11Under review as submission to TMLR + ∫tK t⋆ E[∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥]du). ≤exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]C0(T −tK + ¯β)2(M + δ1/2)/(T −tK)2 ×( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]du+ tK −t⋆). (19) We have that ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]du≤ ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(t⋆ −u)/(2 ¯β)]du≤2 ¯β. (20) In addition, using (14) we have tK −t⋆ = T −ε−T + 2¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))) ≤2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))). (21) Using Lemma D.2, we have thatσ−2 T−tK ≤(1 + ¯β)/ε. Combining this result, (20) and (21) in (19) we get W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤2C0 exp[diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/(2ε)](1 + ¯β)3(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))(M + δ1/2)/ε2, which concludes the proof. 4.2 Control of W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) In this section, we focus on the errorW1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK). First, note thatπPT−tK = πPTQtK. Therefore, using Proposition D.9, we have W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) = W1(π∞QtK,πPTQtK) ≤exp[(1/2)σ−2 T−tK]W1(πPT,π∞). (22) To controlW1(πPT,π∞), we use a synchronous coupling, i.e. we set(Yt,Zt)t∈[0,T] such that dYt = −βtYtdt+ √ 2βtdBt, dZt = −βtZtdt+ √ 2βtdBt, where (Bt)t∈[0,T] is ad-dimensional Brownian motion andY0 ∼π, Z0 ∼π∞. We have that for anyt∈[0,T], Zt ∼π∞. In addition, denotingut = E[∥Yt −Zt∥] for anyt∈[0,T], we have thatut ≤u0 exp[− ∫t 0 βsds]. Therefore, combining this result and (22), we get that W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) ≤exp[(1/2)σ−2 T−tK] exp[− ∫T 0 βtdt]W1(π,π∞). (23) Therefore, using Lemma D.2, we have W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) ≤exp[(1 + ¯β)diam(M)2/(2ε)] exp[−T/¯β]( √ d+ diam(M)). 4.3 Control of W1(πPT−tK,π) and conclusion In this section, we focus on the errorW1(π,πPT−tK) and conclude the proof. We have thatW1(π,πPT−tK) ≤ E[∥X−mT−tKX+ σT−tKZ∥], withX ∼π and Z ∼N(0,Id). Hence, using1 −mT−tK ≤σT−tK, we have W1(π,πPT−tK) ≤diam(M)(1 −mT−tK) + σT−tK √ d≤(diam(M) + √ d)σT−tK. Using Lemma D.2 and this result we have W1(π,πPT−tK) ≤(2 ¯β)1/2(diam(M) + √ d)ε1/2. (24) We conclude the proof upon combining this result, (23) and Proposition 10 in (8) 5 Conclusion In this work, we have studied the convergence of diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis and provided convergence guarantees w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance of order one. Our theoretical results show that diffusion models are able to recover target distributions defined on low-dimensional manifolds. One current 12Under review as submission to TMLR limitation of our results lies in the dependency w.r.t.1/ε which is exponential in the general case and might be overly pessimistic. This dependency can be improved at the cost of imposing conditions on the Hessian of log pt but further investigations are needed to establish similar results in realistic settings. Our results can be extended in several directions. First, in this work we focused on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as a forward noising process. It would be interesting to analyze other forward diffusions such as the critically-damped one (Dockhorn et al., 2021). Another extension would be to study other discretization frameworks such as predictor-corrector schemes (Song et al., 2021a) and to extend our analysis to more realistic statistical settings. Finally, it is a challenge to derive similar bounds for target distributions withRd support and tail constraints. Finally, we would like to deepen our study of the relationship between the geometry of the manifoldMand the properties of the score function. Preliminary results from Appendix J.3 indicate that the convexity ofM can be recovered from the properties of the score but it remains unclear if more can be said on the geometry of the manifold.

A Organization of the appendix The appendix is organized as follows. We start by discussing our discretization scheme in Appendix B. In Appendix C, we provide upper bounds on the gradient and Hessian of the logarithmic gradient of the density of the forward process under the manifold assumption. In Appendix D, we control the stability of several backward processes. In Appendix E, we recall and adapt a stochastic interpolation formula from Del Moral and Singh (2019). We check the different assumptions on the noise schedule in Appendix G. A short proof of the results of Franzese et al. (2022) is presented in Appendix H. In Appendix I, we present an extension of our results in the case where error is controlled w.r.t. theL2 norm, following the work of Lee et al. (2022). We improve on Theorem 1 in Appendix J under some Hessian conditions. B Discretization of backward processes In Appendix B.1, we briefly describe the links between our proposed discretization and the classical Euler- Maruyama discretization. In Appendix B.2, we show that the discretization(5) is associated to the one of Ho et al. (2020) under specific settings B.1 Link with Euler-Maruyama discretization First, we recall the Euler-Maruyama discretization. Given a sequence of stepsizes a discretization of(4) is given by the so-called Euler-Maruyama approximation,i.e. we define for anyk∈{0,...,K }and t∈[tk,tk+1] d ¯YEM t = βT−tk{¯YEM tk + 2s(T −tk, ¯YEM tk )}dt+ √ 2βT−tkdBt, ¯YEM 0 ∼π∞. (25) The associated discrete process(YEM k )k∈{0,...,K+1}is given for anyk∈{0,...,K + 1}by YEM k = ¯YEM tk and we have for anyk∈{0,...,K } YEM k+1 = YEM k + γkβT−tk{YEM k + 2s(T −tk,Y EM k )}+ √ 2βT−tkγkZk, (26) where {Zk}k∈N is a sequence of independentd-dimensional Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. Note that (5) describes the same update as(25) up to the first order w.r.t.γk. In practice, there is no additional cost to replace the classical Euler-Maruyama discretization with the discretization defined in(5), provided that the integral of the temperature schedulet↦→βt can be computed in close form, which is the case in all the cases considered experimentally, see Appendix G. However, in our theoretical analysis we found out that(5) introduces less error than(26) when compared to the approximate backward process(4). In our study we only consider the discretization scheme(Yk)k∈{0,...,K+1} but emphasize that our analysis could be readily extended to derive similar discretization errors for the process (YEM k )k∈{0,...,K+1}. B.2 Equivalence with Ho et al. (2020) In this section, we show that the discretization scheme introduced in Ho et al. (2020) and the one of(5) are equivalent up to the first order in some parameter. 16Under review as submission to TMLR Setting of Ho et al. (2020)We start by recalling the setting of Ho et al. (2020). Since, there is a conflict between our notations and the ones of Ho et al. (2020), we write our constants in red and the constants of Ho et al. (2020) in blue. The forward process in Ho et al. (2020) is given for anyt∈{1,...,T }7 q(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯αtx0,(1 −¯αt) Id), (27) and we define βt = 1 −αt, ¯αt = ∏t s=1 αs. (28) In that case the loss function is given by ℓ(θ) = ∑T t=1 E[∥ϵt −ϵθ(√¯αtx0 + √1 −¯αtϵt,t)∥2], (29) with {ϵt}T t=1 a collection of independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. The backward sampling is given by the following recursion xt−1 = αt −1/2(xt −(βt/√1 −¯αt)ϵθ(xt,t)) + βtzt, (30) with{zt}T t=1 a collection of independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix8. Note that using these notations, there is a conflict of notation between the forward process and the backward process. To clarify our identification, we denoteyt = xt for anyt∈{0,...,T }, withxt given by (30), in what follows. Identification In what follows, we sett= k+ 1, T = K and for anyt∈{1,...,T } αt = exp[−2 ∫T−tK+1−(k+1) T−tK+1−k βsds] = exp[−2 ∫T−tK−k T−tK+1−k βsds]. For instance, we haveα1 = exp[−2 ∫T−tK 0 βsds] and αT = exp[−2 ∫T T−t1 βsds]. Note that in this case, using (28), we have ¯αt1/2 = exp[− ∫T−tK−k 0 βsds] = mT−tK−k. Similarly, √1 −¯αt = σT−tK−k. In what follows, we identify the distribution of the forward process(27) with the one of (1), the loss function (29) with the one of (3) and the time reversal (30) with the one of (5). (a) The distributionq(xt|x0) given in(27) is the distribution ofXT−tK−k|X0 where (Xt)t∈[0,T] is given in (1), sinceXT−tK−k = mT−tK−kX0 + σT−tK−kZ with Z ∼N(0,Id). Therefore, we identifyxt and XT−tK−k for anyt∈{1,...,T }. Similarly, for anyt∈{1,...,T }, we identifyt and T −tK−k. (b) Using thatXt = mtX0 + Bσt for anyt∈{0,...,T }, the loss is given by ℓ(s) = ∫T 0 κ(t)E[∥s(t,Xt) −∇log pt|0(Xt|X0)∥2]dt = ∫T 0 κ(t)E[∥s(t,Xt) + Bσt/σt2∥2]dt = ∫T 0 κ(t)/σt2E[∥−σts(t,Xt) −Bσt/σt∥2]dt = ∫T 0 κ(T −t)/σT−t2E[∥−σT−ts(T −t,XT−t) −BσT−t/σT−t∥2]dt. With a slight abuse of notation we assume thatκ(T −t) = ∑K k=0 δtK−k(t)σT−t2 for anyt∈[0,T]. Hence, we get that ℓ(s) = ∑K k=0 E[∥ϵt −(−σT−tK−ks(T −tK−k,XT−tK−k))∥2] = ∑K k=0 E[∥ϵt −(−√1 −¯αts(T −tK−k,xt))∥2] = ∑T t=1 E[∥ϵt −(−√1 −¯αts(t,√¯αtx0 + √1 −¯αtϵt))∥2] Hence, identifyingϵθ(·,t) and −√1 −¯αts(t,·) for anyt∈{1,...,T }, we recover (29). 7Note that in Ho et al. (2020),T is a number of steps and not the total time of the forward. 8We consider the case whereσt = βt. 17Under review as submission to TMLR (c) We now aim at recovering(30) from (5). Using the change of variablek→K−k and noting that for any t∈(0,T], Bσt/σt is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and identity covariance matrix we have YK−k+1 = YK−k + (exp[ ∫T−tK−k T−tK−k+1 βsds] −1)(YK−k + 2s(T −tK−k,YK−k)) +(exp[2 ∫T−tK−k T−tK−k+1 βsds] −1)1/2ZK−k = YK−k + (αt−1/2 −1)(YK−k + 2s(T −tK−k,YK−k)) + √βtZK−k = αt−1/2YK−k + 2(αt−1/2 −1)s(T −tK−k,YK−k) + √βtZK−k = αt−1/2YK−k −2((αt−1/2 −1)/√1 −¯αt)ϵθ(YK−k,t) + √βtZK−k. (31) Finally, sinceαt = 1 −βt we haveαt1/2 = 1 −βt/2 + o(βt). This implies that 2(αt−1/2 −1) = −βt/√αt + o(βt/√αt). Therefore, combining this result and (31), we get that YK−k+1 = αt−1/2(YK−k + (βt/√1 −¯αt)ϵθ(t,YK−k)) + √βtZK−k + o(βt/√αt). This corresponds to (30) up to a term of the formo(βt/√αt). C Gradient and Hessian controls on the logarithmic density Let π ∈P(Rd) be the target probability measure. We denote(pt)t>0 such that for anyt> 0 the density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure of the distribution ofXt (with initializationXN 0 ∼π) is given bypt. Similarly, πN ∈P(Rd) be an empirical version ofπ, i.e. πN = (1/N) ∑N k=1 Xk, with{Xk}N k=1 ∼π⊗N. We denote (pN t )t>0 such that for anyt >0 the density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure of the distribution ofXN t (with initialization XN 0 ∼πN) is given bypt. In order to show the stability and growth of the processes at hand we need to control quantities related to the gradient and Hessian oflog qt where qt = pt or pN t . We first show a dissipativity condition on the gradient. We recall that for anyt∈[0,T] mt = exp[− ∫t 0 βsds], σ 2 t = 1 −exp[−2 ∫t 0 βsds]. Such dissipativity conditions will allow us to control the moments of the introduced backward processes. Lemma C.1. Assume A1. Then for anyt∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd we have that ⟨∇log qt(xt),xt⟩≤−∥ xt∥2 /σ2 t + mtdiam(M) ∥xt∥/σ2 t, with qt = pN t or pt. In addition, we have ∥∇log qt(xt)∥2 ≤2 ∥xt∥2 /σ4 t + 2m2 tdiam(M)2/σ4 t. (32) Proof. Let N ∈N. We have that for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd pN t (xt) = (1/N) ∑N k=1 exp[−∥xt −mtXk∥2/2σ2 t]/(2πσ2 t)d/2, Therefore, we get that for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd ∇log pN t (xt) = (−1/N) ∑N k=1(xt −mtXk) exp[−∥xt −mtXk∥2/2σ2 t]/((2πσ2 t)d/2σ2 tpN t (xt)). Hence, we have ⟨∇log pN t (xt),xt⟩≤−∥ xt∥2 /σ2 t + mtdiam(M) ∥xt∥/σ2 t. Therefore taking the limitN →+∞, the same conclusion holds forpt. The proof of(32) follows the same lines and is left to the reader. We now provide controls on the Hessian∇2 log qt. Such bounds allow to control the growth (or contraction) of the tangent process. This will also allow us to control the growth (or contraction) of the distance between backward processes w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance of order one. 18Under review as submission to TMLR Lemma C.2. Assume A1 then we have for anyt∈(0,T], xt ∈Rd and M ∈Md(Rd) ⟨M,∇2 log qt(xt)M⟩≤− (1 −m2 tdiam(M)2/(2σ2 t))/σ2 t∥M∥2. In addition, we have ∥∇2 log qt(xt)∥≤ (1 + diam(M)2)/σ4 t. More generally, we have ∇2 log pt(xt) = −Id /σ2 t +(2σ4 t)−1 ∫ M×M(x0 −x′ 0)⊗2 exp[−∥xt −mtx0∥2/(2σ2 t)] exp[−∥xt −mtx′ 0∥2/(2σ2 t)]dπ(x0)dπ(x′ 0) /( ∫ Mexp[−∥xt −mtx0∥2/(2σ2 t)]dπ(x0))2. Proof. Let N ∈N. For anyt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, we let¯pN t = pN t (2πσ2 t)d/2 and we have ¯pN t (x) = (1/N) ∑N k=1 exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/2σ2 t], Hence, we have ∇log ¯pN t (x) = (−1/N) ∑N k=1(x−mtXk) exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/2σ2 t]/(σ2 t ¯pN t (x)). Hence, we get that ∇2 log ¯pN t (x) = −Id /σ2 t +(1/N) ∑N k=1(x−mtXk) ⊗(x−mtXk) exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/2σ2 t]/(σ4 t ¯pN t (x)) −(1/N2)(∑N k=1(x−mtXk) exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/2σ2 t]) ⊗(∑N k=1(x−mtXk) exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/2σ2 t])/(σ2 t ¯pN t (x))2. For anyk∈{0,...,N −1}, denotefk t = −(x−mtXk)/σ2 t and ek t = exp[−∥fk t ∥2]. Using the previous result, we have ∇2 log ¯pN t (x)= −Id /σ2 t + ∑N k=1 fk t ⊗fk t ek t/∑N k=1 ek t −(∑N k=1 fk t ek t/∑N k=1 ek t) ⊗(∑N k=1 fk t ek t/∑N k=1 ek t) = −Id /σ2 t + (1/2) ∑N j,k=1(fk t −fj t) ⊗(fk t −fj t)ek tej t/∑N k,j=1 ek tej t. (33) In addition, using that for anyℓ∈{1,...,N }, Xℓ ∈M we have that ∥fk t −fj t∥= mt∥Xk −Xj∥/σ2 t ≤mtdiam(M)/σ2 t. Therefore, we get that ⟨M,∇2 log ¯pN t (x)M⟩≤− (1 −m2 tdiam(M)2/(2σ2 t))/σ2 t∥M∥2. Using (33), the fact thatMis compact and the strong law of large numbers we have that limN→+∞∇2 log ¯pN t (x) = −Id /σ2 t + ∫ Rd(x−mtx0) ⊗(x−mt¯x0) exp[−∥x−mtx0∥2/(2σ2 t)] exp[−∥x−mt¯x0∥2/(2σ2 t)]dπ(x0)dπ(¯x0) /( ∫ Rd exp[−∥x−mt¯x0∥2/(2σ2 t)]dπ(x0))2. Hence, we get thatlimN→+∞∇2 log pN t (x) = ∇2 log pt, which concludes the proof. Finally, in order to control the local error of the time discretization, we also need to control the time derivative of the gradient,i.e. ∂t∇log qt. 19Under review as submission to TMLR Lemma C.3. Assume A1. Then for anyt∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd we have that ∥∂t∇log qt(xt)∥≤ (βt/σ6 t)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥x∥). Proof. Let N ∈N and t∈(0,T]. Recall that for anyx∈Rd, pN t (x) = ¯pN t (x)/(2πσ2 t)d/2 with ¯pN t (x) = (1/N) ∑N k=1 ek t(x), e k t(x) = exp[−∥x−mtXk∥2/(2σ2 t)]. In what follows, we denotefk t = log ek t for anyk∈{1,...,N }. For anyx∈Rd we have ∂tlog ¯pN t (x) = ∑N k=1 ∂tfk t (x)ek t(x)/∑N k=1 ek t(x). Therefore, we have for anyx∈Rd ∂t∇log ¯pN t (x) = ∑N k=1 ∂t∇fk t (x)ek t(x)/∑N k=1 ek t(x) + ∑N k=1 ∂tfk t (x)∇fk t (x)ek t(x)/∑N k=1 ek t(x) −∑N k,j=1 ∂tfk t (x)∇fj t(x)ek t(x)ej t(x)/∑N k,j=1 ek t(x)ej t(x) = ∑N k=1 ∂t∇fk t (x)ek t(x)/∑N k=1 ek t(x) +(1/2) ∑N k,j=1(∂tfk t (x) −∂tfj t(x))(∇fk t (x) −∇fj t(x))ek t(x)ej t(x)/∑N k,j=1 ek t(x)ej t(x). (34) In what follows, we fixk,j ∈{1,...,N }and provide upper bounds for|∂tfk t −∂tfj t|, ∥∇fk t −∇fj t∥and ∂t∇fk t . First, we have that for anyx∈Rd, ∇fk t (x) = −(x−mtXk)/σ2 t. Hence, using thatmt ≤1, we get that for anyx∈Rd ∥∇fk t (x) −∇fj t(x)∥≤ mtdiam(M)/σ2 t ≤diam(M)/σ2 t. (35) In addition, we have that for anyx∈Rd ∂tfk t (t) = ∂tσ2 t/(2σ4 t)∥x−mtXk∥2 + ∂tmt/σ2 t⟨Xk,x −mtXk⟩. Combining this result, the fact that∂tσ2 t = −2mt∂tmt and that∂tmt = −βtmt, we get that ∂tfk t (t) = −βtmt/σ2 t[−(mt/σ2 t)∥x−mtXk∥2 + ⟨x−mtXk,Xk⟩] = −βtmt/σ2 t⟨x−mtXk,−(mt/σ2 t)(x−mtXk) + Xk⟩ = −βtmt/σ4 t⟨x−mtXk,−mtx+ Xk⟩ = βtmt/σ4 t(mt∥x∥2 + mt∥Xk∥2 + (1 +m2 t)⟨x,Xk⟩). (36) Using this result and thatmt ≤1, we have that for anyx∈Rd |∂tfk t (x) −∂tfj t(x)|≤ 2βtm2 tdiam(M)2/σ4 t + βtmt(1 + m2 t)diam(M)∥x∥/σ4 t (37) ≤2(βt/σ4 t)diam(M)(diam(M) + ∥x∥). Using (36), we have for anyx∈Rd ∇∂tfk t (x) = 2βtm2 t/σ4 tx+ (βtmt/σ4 t)(1 + m2 t)Xk. Therefore, combining this result and the fact thatmt ≤1, we get that for anyx∈Rd ∥∂t∇fk t (x)∥≤ 2(βt/σ4 t)(diam(M) + ∥x∥). (38) Combining (35), (37) and (38) in (34), we get that for anyx∈Rd ∥∂t∇log ¯pN t (x)∥≤ 2(βt/σ4 t)(diam(M) + ∥x∥) + (βt/σ6 t)diam(M)2(diam(M) + ∥x∥) ≤(βt/σ6 t)(2 + diam(M)2)(diam(M) + ∥x∥), which concludes the proof using thatlimN→+∞∂t∇log pN t (xt) = ∂t∇log pt. 20Under review as submission to TMLR We conclude this section with bounds on the higher-order differentials oflog pt. To compute higher derivatives we will use the following lemma. Lemma C.4. Let E = {ei}M i=1 be a family of functions such that for anyi∈{1,...,M }, ei ∈C∞(Rd,R). Similarly, letG= {gi}M i=1 be a family of functions such that for anyi∈{1,...,M }, gi ∈C∞(Rd,Rp). Let F(E,G) such that for anyx∈Rd F(E,G) = ∑M i=1 giei/∑M i=1 ei. Then, we have ∇F(E,G) = F(E,∇G) + (1/2)F(E⊗E,(G⊖G) ⊙(∇log E⊖∇log E)), where ⊗is the tensor product,⊙the pointwise product and⊖the tensor substraction. Proof. We assume thatp= 1. The proof in the general case is similar and left to the reader. We have that ∇F(E,G) = ∑M i=1 ∇giei/∑M i=1 ei + ∑M i,j=1 gi∇log(ei)eiej/∑M i,j=1 eiej −∑M i,j=1 gi∇log(ej)eiej/∑M i,j=1 eiej = ∑M i=1 ∇giei/∑M i=1 ei +(1/2) ∑M i,j=1(gi∇log(ei) + gj∇log(ej) −gi∇log(ej) −gj∇log(ei))eiej/∑M i,j=1 eiej = ∑M i=1 ∇giei/∑M i=1 ei +(1/2) ∑M i,j=1(gi −gj)(∇log ei −∇log ej)/∑M i,j=1 eiej, which concludes the proof. Lemma C.5. Assume A1. Then, there existsC ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] we have ∥∇2 log pt(x)∥+ ∥∇3 log pt(x)∥+ ∥∇4 log pt(x)∥≤ C/σ8 t. Proof. Let t∈(0,T]. First, remark that for anyx∈Rd ∇2 log pt(x) = −Id /σ2 t + F(E⊗2,(∇log E⊖∇log E)⊙2), where E = {ei}N i=1 and for anyi∈{1,...,N }, ei(x) = exp[−∥x−mtXi∥2/(2σ2 t)]. Note that∇log E⊖∇log E does not depend onxand there existsC0 ≥0 such that for anyi,j ∈{1,...,N }, ∥∇log ei(x)−∇log ej(x)∥≤ C0/σ2 t. Hence, using Lemma C.4 we have ∇3 log pt(x) = F(E⊗4,(∇log E⊖∇log E)⊙2 ⊙(∇log(E⊗E) ⊖∇log(E⊗E))). Again, note thatG1 = (∇log E⊖∇log E)⊙2 ⊙(∇log(E⊗E) ⊖∇log(E⊗E)) does not depend onx, upon remarking that ∇log(E⊗E) ⊖∇log(E⊗E) = (∇log E⊖∇log E) ⊕(∇log E⊖∇log E). Finally, we have∇4 log pt(x) = F(E⊗8,G2), where G2 = [((∇log E⊖∇log E)⊙2 ⊙(∇log(E⊗E) ⊖∇log(E⊗E))) ⊖((∇log E⊖∇log E)⊙2 ⊙(∇log(E⊗E) ⊖∇log(E⊗E)))] ⊙(∇log(E⊗4) ⊖∇log(E⊗4)). Therefore, we get that there existsC ≥0 such that for anyx∈Rd ∥∇log p3 t(x)∥≤ C/σ6 t, ∥∇log p4 t(x)∥≤ C/σ8 t. We conclude the proof upon using thatσt ≤1. 21Under review as submission to TMLR D Control of the backward processes We start by introducing the different processes in Appendix D.1. We gather a few technical results in Appendix D.2. Then, we turn to the stability and Lipschitz properties of the backward processes in Appendix D.3. Finally, we control the growth of the backward tangent process in Appendix D.4. D.1 Introduction of the processes In this section, we study the stability of the backward process given by dYt = βT−t{Yt + 2∇log qT−t(Yt)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, (39) where qt is eitherpt or pN t . We are also going to consider the following approximate continuous-time process d ˆYt = βT−t{ˆYt + 2s(T −t, ˆYt)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, (40) where s(t,·) is an approximation of eitherpt or pN t . Note that sinceqt > 0 and q ∈C∞((0,T] ×Rd,Rd) and thats∈C1((0,T] ×Rd,Rd) we have that(39) and (40) admit strong solutions up to an explosion time. Finally, we also consider the following interpolating process: for anyt∈[tk,tk+1) d ¯Yt = βT−t{¯Yt + 2s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt. (41) This process is an interpolation of a modified Euler–Maruyama discretization of(40). Note that the classical Euler–Maruyama discretization would be associated with the following interpolation d ¯YEM t = βT−tk{¯YEM tk + 2s(T −tk, ¯YEM tk )}dt+ √ 2βT−tkdBt. In (41), we take advantage of the linear part of the drift. Indeed on the interval[tk,tk+1], the process(41) is a simple Ornstein–Uhlenbeck which can be integrated explicitly. In particular for anyk∈{0,...,N −1}and t∈[tk,tk+1] we have ¯Yt = ¯Ytk + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)( ¯Ytk + 2s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)1/2Z, where Z is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and identity covariance and the equality holds in distribution independent from¯Ytk. Denoting {Yk}k∈{0,...,N−1}, we get that for anyk∈{0,...,N −1} Yk+1 = Yk + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)1/2Zk, where {Zk}k∈N is a collection of independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and identity covariance matrix. Using this scheme instead of the classical Euler–Maruyama simplifies the analysis of the discretization. Up to the first order this scheme is equal to the classical Euler–Maruyama discretization. Once again, we emphasize that computing this scheme is as expensive as computing the classical Euler–Maruyama discretization provided that the integral ∫t s βudu are available in close form for alls,t ∈[0,T] which is the case for all the discretization schemes used in practice. We refer to Table 1 for a list of all processes used in the proof. In what follows, we control the stability of these processes. D.2 Some useful technical lemmas We gather in this section some technical results. Lemma D.1. For anys,t ∈[0,T] we have ∫t s βT−u/σ2 T−udu= [(−1/2) log(exp[2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv] −1)]t s, (42) ∫t s βT−um2 T−u/σ4 T−udu= [(1/2)/(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv])]t s. (43) In particular, ifβ = β0 then ∫t s βT−u/σ2 T−udu= [(−1/2) log(exp[2β0(T −u)] −1)]t s, ∫t s βT−um2 T−u/σ4 T−udu= [(1/2)/(1 −exp[−2β0(T −u)])]t s. 22Under review as submission to TMLR Proof. We have ∫t s βT−u/σ2 T−udu= ∫t s βT−u/(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv])du = ∫t s βT−uexp[2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv]/(exp[2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv] −1)du = (−1/2) ∫t s ∂ulog(exp[2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv] −1)du. This concludes the proof of (42). We have ∫t s βT−um2 T−u/σ4 T−udu= ∫t s βT−um2 T−u/(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv])2du = ∫t s βT−uexp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv]/(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv])2du = (1/2) ∫t s ∂u(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−u 0 βvdv])−1du. This concludes the proof of (43). Lemma D.2. Assume A2. We haveσ2 t ≤2t¯β and σ−2 t ≤1 + ¯β/(2t). Proof. First, using that for anya≥0, exp[−a] ≥1 −a we have σ2 t = 1 −exp[−2 ∫t 0 βsds] ≤1 −exp[−2 ¯βt] ≤2 ¯βt. Second, using that for anya≥0, 1/(1 + exp[−a]) ≤1 + 1/a we have σ−2 t = (1 −exp[−2 ∫t 0 βsds])−1 ≤1 + (2 ∫t 0 βsds)−1, which concludes the proof. For anyk∈{0,...,K }we introduceκk = supu∈[T−tk+1,T−tk] βu/σ2 u. Lemma D.3. Assume A2. Then, we have that for anyk∈{0,...,N −1} κk ≤¯β(1 + ¯β/t). Proof. Recall that for anys∈[0,T], σ2 s = 1 −exp[−2 ∫s 0 βudu]. Using that for anyv ≥0, (1 −e−2v)−1 ≤ 1 + 1/(2v) we have for anyt∈(0,T] βt/σ2 t ≤βt + βt(2 ∫t 0 βsds)−1 ≤βt(1 + ¯β/t), which concludes the proof. D.3 Stability and Lipschitz properties of the backward processes The controls derived in Appendix C allow for uniform control of the moments of the backward processes. Note that such Lyapunov techniques were used in Fontaine et al. (2021) to control energy functionals in convex optimization problems. The following lemma is not used directly in our final analysis but provides intuitive controls on the backward process. Lemma D.4. Assume A1, A3 and that there existsη >0 such thatM + ηdiam(M) ≤1/4. Then, for any t∈[0,T] we have E[∥ˆYt∥2] ≤d+ 8(1 +M + diam(M)/η). In particular ifM ≤1/8 then for anyt∈[0,T] we have E[∥ˆYt∥2] ≤d+ 8(1 +M + 8diam(M)2). 23Under review as submission to TMLR Proof. First, using Lemma C.1, we have that for anyt∈[0,T), E[∥ˆYt∥2] <+∞. Hence, using Itô’s lemma, we have d(1/2)∥ˆYt∥2 = βT−t{∥ˆYt∥2 + 2⟨s(T −t, ˆYt), ˆYt⟩+ 2}dt+ √ 2βT−t⟨ˆYt,dBt⟩. Therefore, usingA3, Lemma C.1 and that for anya,b,η >0, 2ab≤a2η+ b2/η we get that for anyt∈[0,T) we have that(1/2)E[∥ˆYt∥2] ≤ut, whereu0 = d/2 and dut = βT−t(1 −2/σ2 T−t + 2(M + ηmT−tdiam(M))/σ2 T−t)ut + βT−t(2 + 2M + 2mT−tdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−t = βT−t(σ2 T−t −2 + 2(M + ηmT−tdiam(M)))/σ2 T−tut + βT−t(2 + 2M + 2mT−tdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−t. For anyt∈[0,T] and x∈R define F(t,x) given by F(t,x) = −(2 −σ2 T−t −2(M + mT−tηdiam(M)))/σ2 T−tx+ (2 + 2M + 2mT−tdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−t. Using that for anyt∈[0,T], mt,σ2 t ∈[0,1], we have that for anyt∈[0,T] 2 −σ2 T−t −2(M + ηmT−tdiam(M)) ≥1 −2(M + ηdiam(M)) ≥1/2. Using (Fontaine et al., 2021, Lemma 3) we get that for anyt∈[0,T] ut ≤d/2 + 2(1 +M + diam(M)/η)/(1 −2(M + ηdiam(M))) ≤d/2 + 4(1 +M + diam(M)/η), which concludes the proof. Lemma D.5. Assume A1, A2 and A3. Assume that there existsδ >0 such that for anyk∈{0,...,K }, γkβT−tk/σ2 T−tk ≤δ. Assume that there existsη >0 such thatA(δ,M,η, diam(M)) >0 with A(δ,M,η, diam(M)) = 2 −2δ−32δ(1 + M2) −8M −4ηdiam(M), B(δ,M,η, diam(M)) = 32δ(M2 + diam(M)2) + 2(1 +δ)(diam(M)/η+ M) + 4d. Then, we have for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Yk∥2] ≤K = d+ B(δ,M,η, diam(M))(1/A(δ,M,η, diam(M)) + δ). (44) In particular ifM ≤1/32 and δ≤1/32 then for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Yk∥2] ≤K0 = 5d+ 320(1 + diam(M))2. Proof. Recall that using (5), we have that for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} Yk+1 = Yk + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)1/2Zk, (45) For simplicity, we denote γ1,k = (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)/βT−tk, γ 2,k = (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)/(2βT−tk). Then, (45) can be rewritten for anyk∈{0,...,K −1}as Yk+1 = Yk + γ1,kβT−tk(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + √ 2γ2,kβT−tkZk. (46) In what follows, we denote¯γ1,k = γ1,kβT−tk and ¯γ2,k = γ2,kβT−tk. In addition, using thatγkβT−tk ≤δ≤1/4, we have thatγ1,k ≤γ2,k ≤2γ1,k. Indeed, we have that for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} γ2,k/γ1,k = (1/2)(exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] + 1) ≥1, γ2,k/γ1,k = (1/2)(exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] + 1) ≤(1/2)(exp[γkβT−tk] + 1) ≤2, 24Under review as submission to TMLR Using Lemma C.1, we have that for anyt∈[0,T], xt ∈Rd and η >0 ⟨xt,s(t,xt)⟩≤−∥ xt∥2/σ2 t + mtdiam(M)∥xt∥/σ2 t + M(1 + ∥xt∥)∥xt∥/σ2 t ≤(−1 + 2M + ηmtdiam(M)) ∥xt∥2 /σ2 t + (mtdiam(M)/η+ M)/σ2 t, (47) where we have used that for anya,b ≥0, 2ab≤ηa2 + b2/η in the last line. In addition, using Lemma C.1, for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd we have ∥s(t,xt)∥2 ≤2∥s(t,xt) −∇log pt(xt)∥2 + 2∥∇log pt(xt)∥2 ≤4M2(1 + ∥xt∥2)/σ4 t + 4∥xt∥2/σ4 t + 4m2 tdiam(M)2/σ4 t ≤4(1 + M2)∥xt∥2/σ4 t + 4(M2 + m2 tdiam(M)2)/σ4 t. (48) Combining (46), (47) and (48) we have for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} E[∥Yk+1∥2] = (1 + ¯γ1,k)2E[∥Yk∥2] + 4¯γ2 1,kE[∥s(T −tk,Yk)∥2] + 4¯γ1,k(1 + ¯γ1,k)E[⟨Yk,s(T −tk,Yk)⟩] + 2¯γ2,kd ≤(1 + 2¯γ1,k + ¯γ2 1,k)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(M2 + m2 T−tkdiam(M)2) + 4¯γ1,k(1 + ¯γ1,k)E[⟨Yk,s(T −tk,Yk)⟩] + 4¯γ1,kd ≤(1 + 2¯γ1,k + ¯γ2 1,k)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(M2 + m2 T−tkdiam(M)2) + 4(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)(1 + ¯γ1,k)(−1 + 2M + ηmT−tkdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2] + (¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)(1 + ¯γ1,k)(mT−tkdiam(M)/η+ M) + 4¯γ1,kd. In what follows, we letδk = ¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk. Using that for anyt∈[0,T], mt,σt ∈[0,1] we have E[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤(1 + 2δk + δ2 k)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16δ2 k(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16δ2 k(M2 + diam(M)2) + 4δk(1 + δk)(−1 + 2M + ηdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2] + δk(1 + δk)(diam(M)/η+ M) + 4δkd Since s↦→βs is non-decreasing, thatβT−tkγk ≤δ≤1/4 and that for anyw∈[0,1/2], ew −1 ≤1 + 2w, we have exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1 ≤exp[βT−tkγk] −1 ≤2βT−tkγk. Therefore, we get thatδk ≤2γkβT−tk/σ2 T−tk ≤2δ. Since δk ≤2δ we have E[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤(1 + 2δk + 2δkδ)E[∥Yk∥2] + 32δkδ(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 4δk(−1 + 2M + ηdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2] + 32δkδ(M2 + diam(M)2) + 2δk(1 + δ)(diam(M)/η+ M) + 4δkd. Hence, we have that E[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤(1 + δk[−2 + 2δ+ 32δ(1 + M2) + 8M + 4ηdiam(M)])E[∥Yk∥2] + δk[32δ(M2 + diam(M)2) + 2(1 +δ)(diam(M)/η+ M) + 4d]. Denote A= 2−2δ−32δ(1+ M2)−8M−4ηdiam(M), B = 32δ(M2 +diam(M)2)+2(1+ δ)(diam(M)/η+M)+4 d. Then, we have E[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤(1 −δkA)E[∥Yk∥2] + δkB. 25Under review as submission to TMLR Hence, if E[∥Yk∥2] ≥B/A we have thatE[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤E[∥Yk∥2]. In addition, if E[∥Yk∥2] ≤B/A then, E[∥Yk+1∥2] ≤B/A+ δB. Therefore, we conclude by recursion that for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Yk∥2] ≤d+ B(1/A+ δ), which concludes the first part of the proof. Ifδ,M ≤1/32 then, A(δ,M,η, diam(M)) ≥1/2 −4ηdiam(M). We conclude upon settingη= 1/(16diam(M)). In that caseA(δ,M,η, diam(M)) ≥1/4 and B(δ,M,η, diam(M)) ≤32δ(M2 + diam(M)2) + 2(1 +δ)(16diam(M) + M) + 4d ≤64(1 + diam(M) + diam(M)2) + 4d, which concludes the proof. Note that the same result holds for( ¯Yt)t∈[0,tK]. Lemma D.6. Assume A1, A2 and A3. In addition, assume that for any k ∈ {0,...,K −1}, γkβT−tk/σ2 T−tk ≤δ≤1/4. Then, we have for anyk∈{0,...,K −1}and t∈[tk,tk+1] E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤LβT−tkγk, with L = 8(1 + δ)(16(5 + M2)K + 16(4diam(M)2 + M2)) + 4 and whereK is defined in(44). In particular if M ≤1/32 and δ≤1/32 E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤L0βT−tkγk = (64d+ 20544(1 + diam(M))2)βT−tkγk. Proof. Recall that ¯Yt = ¯Ytk + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)( ¯Ytk + 2s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)1/2Z, where Z is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and identity covariance and the equality holds in distribution independent from¯Ytk. Therefore, we get that E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤2(exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)2(E[∥¯Ytk∥2] + 4E[∥s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)∥2]) +(exp[2 ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)d. (49) In addition, usingA3, Lemma C.1 and that for anyt∈[0,T], mt ∈[0,1], we get that for anyu∈[0,T] and xu ∈Rd ∥s(u,xu)∥≤ M(1 + ∥xu∥)/σ2 u + 2∥xu∥/σ2 u + 2diam(M)/σ2 u ≤(1/σ2 u){(M + 2)∥xu∥+ (M + 2diam(M))}. Combining this result and (49), we get that E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] = 2(exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)2(E[∥¯Ytk∥2] +4E[∥s(T −tk, ¯Ytk)∥2]) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)d ≤2(exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)2E[∥¯Ytk∥2] + 32(4 +M2)(exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)2E[∥¯Ytk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + 32(exp[ ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)2(4diam(M)2 + M2)/σ2 T−tk +(exp[2 ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1)d. (50) Since s↦→βs is non-decreasing, thatβT−tkγk ≤δ≤1/4 and that for anyw∈[0,1/2], e2w −1 ≤1 + 4w, we have for anyα∈{1,2} exp[α ∫T−tk T−t βsds] −1 ≤exp[αβT−tkγk] −1 ≤2αβT−tkγk. 26Under review as submission to TMLR Combining this result and (51), we get that E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤8β2 T−tkγ2 kE[∥¯Ytk∥2 + 32(4 +M2)∥¯Ytk∥2/σ2 T−tk + 32(4diam(M)2 + M2)/σ2 T−tk] + 4βT−tkγkd (51) ≤8(β2 T−tkγ2 k/σ2 T−tk)(32(5 + M2)E[∥¯Ytk∥2] + 32(4diam(M)2 + M2)) + 4βT−tkγkd. Therefore, using Lemma D.5 and (44), we get that E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤8(β2 T−tkγ2 k/σ2 T−tk)(32(5 + M2)K + 32(4diam(M)2 + M2)) + 4βT−tkγkd ≤{256δ((5 + M2)K + 4diam(M)2 + M2) + 4d}βT−tkγk which concludes the first part of the proof. Now assuming thatδ,M ≤1/32 we have E[∥¯Yt −¯Ytk∥2] ≤(64K + 64diam(M)2 + 16d)βT−tkγk ≤64d+ 20544(1 + diam(M))2, which concludes the proof. D.4 Control of the tangent backward process We now introduce the tangent process associated with(Yt)t∈[0,T]. We have d∇Yt = βT−t(Id +2∇2 log pT−t(Yt))∇Ytdt, ∇Y0 = Id . (52) We recall that controlling the tangent process allows to control the Wasserstein distance between the original process and its target measure. Indeed, let(Yx t)t∈[0,T] and (Yy t)t∈[0,T] be the processes given by(39) with initial conditionx and y respectively. Then we have that for anyt∈[0,T] ∥Yx t −Yy t∥≤ ∫1 0 ∥∇Yzλ t ∥dλ∥x−y∥, (53) where (∇Yx t)t∈[0,T] is the tangent process given by(52) and associated with (Yzλ t )t∈[0,T], where zλ = λx+ (1 −λ)y. Before providing controls in the general setting, we take a detour and focus on the case where diam(M) = 0, i.e. π = δ0. In the following proposition, we show that in this case the backward process converges in finite-time. This highlights the role of the diameter of the manifold in the subsequent analysis. Proposition D.7. Assume A1 and thatdiam(M) = 0, i.e. π= δ0. Then, we have that for anyx,y ∈Rd and t∈[0,T] W1(δxQt,δyQy) ≤2 exp[(1/2) ∫T T−tβsds](exp[2 ∫T 0 βsds] −1)−1/2(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βsds] −1)1/2 ∥x−y∥. In particular, we have that for anyx∈Rd, δxQT = π, i.e. the backward diffusion converges in finite time no matter the initialization distribution. Proof. Let t∈[0,T]. Using Lemma C.2, we have that for anyM ∈Md(R) ⟨M,∇2 log qt(xt)M⟩≤− σ−2 t ∥M∥2. In particular, we have that for anyM ∈Md(R) βT−t⟨M,Id +2∇2 log qT−t(xt)M⟩≤ (βT−t −2βT−tσ−2 T−t)∥M∥2. (54) Using Lemma D.1, we have ∫t 0 (βT−s −2βT−sσ−2 T−s)ds = ∫t 0 βT−sds+ log(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βsds] −1) −log(exp[2 ∫T 0 βsds] −1) = ∫T T−tβsds+ log(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βsds] −1) −log(exp[2 ∫T 0 βsds] −1). 27Under review as submission to TMLR Finally, we have that exp[ ∫t 0 (βT−s −2βT−sσ−2 T−s)ds] ≤exp[ ∫T T−tβsds](exp[2 ∫T 0 βsds] −1)−1(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βsds] −1). Hence, using this result, (52) and (54), we get that (1/2)∥∇Yt∥2 ≤exp[ ∫T T−tβsds](exp[2 ∫T 0 βsds] −1)−1(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βsds] −1), which concludes the first part of the proof, using(53). For the second part of the proof, we first remark that for any x,y ∈Rd, W1(δxQT,δyQT) = 0 . Therefore, for any probability measures µ,ν such that∫ Rd ∥x∥dµ(x) <+∞and ∫ Rd ∥x∥dν(x) <+∞, we haveW1(µQT,νQT) = 0 We conclude upon combining this result and that(δxPT)QT = δx. Note that it is also possible to explicitly write down the backward stochastic process in this case since∇log pt is available in close form. One can remark that in this case we recover an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck bridge. In the case where the diameter is non-zero, we cannot recover such a contraction. However, it is possible to obtain a contraction up to a certain point. The following lemma will allow us to control the growth of the tangent process. Lemma D.8. Assume A2 and thatT ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Let t⋆ ∈[0,T] given by t⋆ = T −2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Then, for anyt∈[0,t⋆] we have ∫t 0 βT−s(1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s)ds≤−(1/2) ∫t 0 βT−tds. In addition, for anyt∈[t⋆,T] ∫t t⋆ βT−s(1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s)ds≤(diam(M)2/2)(σ−2 T−t −σ−2 T−t⋆). Proof. Let s∈[0,T]. Note that we have 1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s ≤−1/2, (55) if and only if 3σ4 T−t −4σ2 T−s + 2m2 T−sdiam(M)2 ≤0. Hence, using this result and the fact thatσ2 T−s = 1 −m2 T−s we have that (55) is satisfied if and only if 3m4 T−s + 2(diam(M)2 −1)m2 T−s −1 ≤0. Introduce P(u) = 3u2 + 2(diam(M)2 −1)u−1. We have thatP(u) ≤0 for u∈[0,u0] with u0 = [−(diam(M)2 −1) + ((diam(M)2 −1)2 + 3)1/2]/3 = (δ+ (δ2 + 3)1/2)/3, where δ= diam(M)2 −1 ∈[−1,+∞). If diam(M)2 −1 ≥1 then, using this result and the fact that for any a∈[0,+∞), (1 + a)1/2 ≥1 + a/2 −a2/8 we have u0 ≥δ(−1 + (1 + 3/δ2)1/2)/3 ≥δ(1/(2δ2) −3/(8δ4)) ≥(1/2 −3/8)/δ≥1/(8δ). (56) In addition, if δ ≤1 then δ2 ∈[0,1]. Using this result and the fact that for anya ∈[0,1], √3 + a ≥ (2 − √ 3)a+ √ 3 we have u0 ≥(−δ+ (3 +δ2)1/2)/3 ≥(−|δ|+ (3 +|δ|2)1/2)/3 ≥((1 − √ 3)|δ|+ √ 3)/3 ≥1/3. 28Under review as submission to TMLR Combining this result and (56), we get that u0 ≥1/(8(1 + |δ|)). Therefore, we get that for anyt∈[0,T] such thatm2 T−t ≤1/(8(1 + |δ|)) 1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s ≤−1/2. Hence, for anyt∈[0,T] such thatexp[−2(T −t)/¯β] ≤1/(8(1 + |δ|)) 1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s ≤−1/2. Let t⋆ 0 such thatexp[−2(T −t⋆ 0)/¯β] = 1/(8(1 + |δ|)). We get that t⋆ 0 = T −( ¯β/2) log(8(1 +|δ|)). Using that for anya≥0, 1 + |a2 −1|≤ 2(1 + a)2 and thatlog(16) ≤4, we get that t⋆ 0 ≥T −( ¯β/2)(log(16(1 + diam(M))2)) ≥t⋆ = T −2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))). Hence, sincet↦→mT−t is non-decreasing, we get that for anyt∈[0,t⋆], mT−t ≤1/(8(1 + |δ|)) and therefore 1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s ≤−1/2, which concludes the first part of the proof. The second part of the proof follows from Lemma D.1 and ∫t t⋆ βT−s(1 −2/σ2 T−s + m2 T−sdiam(M)2/σ4 T−s)ds ≤(diam(M)2/2)[(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−t 0 βsds])−1 −(1 −exp[−2 ∫T−t⋆ 0 βsds])−1] ≤(diam(M)2/2)(σ−2 T−t −σ−2 T−t⋆), which concludes the proof. The control of the tangent process in the case wherediam(M) >0 is given in Proposition 6. Proposition D.9. Assume A1 and T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Then, for anyx,y ∈Rd and t∈[0,tK] W1(δxQt,δyQt) ≤exp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK]∥x−y∥. Proof. This is a direct consequence of (53) and Proposition 6. E A stochastic interpolation formula In this section, we present a formula first introduced in Del Moral and Singh (2019) which is a stochastic extension of the Alekseev–Gröbner formula (Alekseev, 1961). We recall the definition of the stochastic flows (Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T] and the interpolation of its discretization( ¯Yx s,t)s,t∈[0,T], for anyx∈Rd dYx s,t = βT−t{Yx s,t + 2∇log qT−t(Yx s,t)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, Yx s,s = x. and d ¯Yx s,t = βT−t{¯Yx s,t + 2s(T −tk, ¯Yx s,tk)}dt+ √ 2βT−tdBt, ¯Yx s,s = x. The following proposition is a straightforward application of (Del Moral and Singh, 2019, Theorem 1.2). Note that these results apply since the drift and the volatility of the backward processes have bounded differential up to order three, see Lemma C.5. Proposition E.1. Assume A1. Then, for anys,t ∈[0,T) with s<t and x∈Rd Yx s,t −¯Yx s,t = ∫t s(∇Y ¯Ys,u u,t )⊤∆bu(( ¯Ys,v)v∈[s,u])du, where for anyu∈[0,T) such thatu∈[tk,tk+1) for somek∈{0,...,K −1}and (ωv)v∈[s,u] ∈C([s,u] ,Rd) we have bu(ω) = βT−u(ωu + 2∇log qT−u(ωu)), ¯bu(ω) = βT−tu(ωu + 2s(T −tk,ωtk)), ∆bu(ω) = bu(ω) −¯bu(ω). 29Under review as submission to TMLR F Additional comments on Theorem 1 In this section, we discuss the validity ofA3 and then comment the suboptimality of the bound of Theorem 1. F.1 Validity of A3 First, we highlight that underA1, A3 is satisfied if for anyt ∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd we have∥s(t,xt) − ∇log pt(xt)∥≤ Mr∥∇log pt(xt)∥with Mr ≥0. Indeed, using this condition A1, Lemma C.1 and letting M = 4Mr(1 + diam(M)), we get thatA3 is satisfied. Hence,A3 is implied by a control on therelative error between the score function and its approximation. Assume thatπ = δ0. Then in that case∇log pt = ∇log pt|0(·|0) and we can compute explicitly the error ∥s(t,xt) −∇log pt(xt)∥at given query points(t,xt). In Figure 1, we analyze this error in a two-dimensional setting. In particular, we recover that the behavior of the error is explosive as∥x∥→ +∞and t→0. Figure 1: Target is a Dirac mass at 0. Left: norm of the true score∥∇log pt|0(x)∥(x-axis: time evolution (T = 1), y-axis: spatial evolution (along the first coordinate, second coordinate is fixed to0). Right: norm of the error between the estimated score and the true score∥s(t,x) −∇log pt|0(x)∥(x-axis: time evolution (T = 1), y-axis: spatial evolution (along the first coordinate, second coordinate is fixed to0). Finally, we conclude this study by illustrating the explosive behavior of the norm of the score in a two- dimensional setting (we restrict ourselves to this small dimensional setting so that we can get a dense grid of query points without encountering memory issues), see Figure 2. We emphasize that the norm of the score has a similar behavior as the error term,i.e. it is explosive as∥x∥→ +∞and t→0. Figure 2: Target is the uniform distribution on two concentric circles. Left: samples from the target distribution (orange) and samples from the diffusion model (blue). Middle: trajectories of the diffusion model. Right: norm of the estimated score∥s(t,x)∥(x-axis: time evolution (T = 1), y-axis: spatial evolution (along the first coordinate, second coordinate is fixed to0). 30Under review as submission to TMLR In both settings, the score function is learned by minimizing the Denoising Score Matching objective(3) using the ADAM optimizer. The architecture of the network and training settings are similar to the ones used in De Bortoli et al. (2021a). F.2 Suboptimality of the bound Recall that the generative model is given by L(YK). In Theorem 1, we provide an upper bound on W1(L(YK),π). In this section, we compare the obtained bound with a bound onW1(L(Y0),π). Recall that Y0 ∼N(0,Id). Considering any coupling(X,Y0) such thatX ∼π and Y0 ∼N(0,Id), we have W1(L(Y0),π) ≤E[∥X∥] + E[∥Y0∥] ≤diam(M) + √ d. This naive bound can be better than the one obtained in Theorem 1, especially for large values ofD0. If that is the case then the derived bound seems to be vacuous at first sight since diffusing the process backward does not improve the Wasserstein distance of order one between the obtained model and the target measure. However, we argue that such cases are possible especially if we are using a poor estimation of the score,i.e. a large value ofM in A3. Indeed, neglecting the discretization error and settingβ = 1 for simplicity, the backward process is given by d ˆYt = {ˆYt + 2s(T −t, ˆYt)}dt+ √ 2dBt, ˆY0 ∼π∞= N(0,Id). (57) Assume thats= 0 (which is approximately the case at initialization if we parameterizes with a neural network with a fully connected last layer and no non-linearity), then the dynamics becomes d ˆYt = ˆYtdt+ √ 2dBt, ˆY0 ∼π∞= N(0,Id). (58) In that case, for anyt ∈[0,T], ˆYt is Gaussian and we have thatL( ˆYt) = N(0,((3 exp[2t] −1)/2) Id). In addition, we have that for anyf : Rd →R which is1-Lipschitz we have W1(L( ˆYT),π) ≥E[f( ˆYt)] − ∫ Rd f(x)dπ(x). Choosing f(x) = |x1|for anyx= (x1,...,x d) ∈Rd in the previous inequality we get, W1(L( ˆYT),π) ≥(3 exp[2T] −1)1/2 −diam(M). Therefore, choosingT ≥0 large enough and using(57), we get thatW1(L( ˆYT),π) ≥W1(L( ˆY0),π). This result implies that even in idealized setting, the backward process might steer the Gaussian distributionaway from the target distributionπ. This is due to theexplosive property of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process(58) which should be compared to thecontractive behavior of the forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (1). G Assumptions on the schedule In what follows, we consider three schedules commonly used in practice: (a) the constant schedule, (b) the linear schedule, (c) the cosine schedule. We show thatA2 is satisfied in all these cases. We consider a generalized version of the cosine schedule which makes it differentiable by replacing the hard clamping by a soft version with levelr> 0 (note that lettingr→0 we recover the original cosine schedule). The constant schedule is defined byβs = β0 for alls∈[0,T]. The linear schedule was introduced in Ho et al. (2020) and is defined byβs = β0 + (βT −β0)t/T with βT >β0 >0. Finally, the cosine schedule was introduced in (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021, Equation (17)) in discrete-time and can be defined as follows in continuous-time βt = softminr(1,lim h→0 (¯αt−h −¯αt)/(¯αt−hh)) = softminr(1,f)t, f (t) = −¯α′ t/¯αt, with ¯α defined as ¯αt = cos((t/T + η)/(1 + η)(π/2))2/cos(η/(1 + η)(π/2))2, and whereη≥0, r> 0 are parameters and for anyf1,f2 : [0 ,T] →R+ softminr(f1,f2)t = −rlog(exp[−f1(t)/r] + exp[−f2(t)/r]). 31Under review as submission to TMLR In the special case wheref1 = 1 we have softminr(1,f2)t = 1 −rlog(1 + exp[(1−f2(t))/r]), We have ¯α′(t)/¯α(t) = −π/(T(1 + η)) tan((t/T + η)/(1 + η)(π/2)). In particular,t↦→βt is increasing and bounded above and below on[0,T]. Finally, we end this section by remarking that if one aims at studying the Euler-Maruyama discretization of the approximate backward,i.e. the process given by(26) then one needs to also assume some Lipschitz property on the schedules↦→βs. H A short proof of the results of Franzese et al. (2022) In (Franzese et al., 2022, Equation (9)), the authors show that (under mild regularity assumptions9) ∫ Rd log pθ,T(x)p0(x)dx≥ ∫ Rd log p0(x)p0(x)dx−G(sθ,T) −KL(pT|p∞). (59) To do so, they rearrange the ELBO result from Huang et al. (2021). We have that (59) is equivalent to KL(p0|pθ,T) ≤G(sθ,T) + KL(pT|p∞). (60) The definition ofG(sθ,T) is given by G(sθ,T) = (1/2)( ∫T 0 β2 tE[∥sθ(t,Xt) −∇log pt|0(Xt|X0)∥2]dt − ∫T 0 β2 tE[∥∇log pt(Xt) −∇log pt|0(Xt|X0)∥2]). Developing the square and using thatE[∇log pt|0(Xt|X0)|Xt] = ∇log pt(Xt), we get that G(sθ,T) = ∫T 0 β2 tE[∥sθ(t,Xt) −∇log pt(Xt)∥2]dt. Hence, combining this result and(60), we have that(59) is equivalent to (Song et al., 2021a, Theorem 1) which is obtained upon combining the data-processing inequality, the decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler via conditioning and the Girsanov theorem. I Wasserstein controls under L2 errors In this section, we replace the assumptionA3 by the following weaker control. A5. There exists∈C([0,T] ×Rd,Rd) and M ≥0 such that for anyk∈{0,...,K }and xt ∈Rd, E[∥s(T −tk,Yk) −∇log pT−tk(Yk)∥2] ≤M2E[(1 + ∥Yk∥2)]/σ4 T−tk, where we recall that(Yk)k∈{0,...,K} is given by(5). Note that this assumption is different from the one of Lee et al. (2022) as the expectation is considered w.r.t. {Yk}K k=0 and not{Ytk}K k=0. In order to control theL2 error, Lee et al. (2022) use a change of measure and control theχ2 divergence between the density ofYk and the oneYtk for anyk∈{0,...,K }. These controls are obtained using a logarithmic Sobolev assumption on the target measureπ. Adapting these results to our Wasserstein distance setting is not straightforward and is left for future work. UnderA5, we have the following theorem, which is an extension of Theorem 1. To prove this theorem, we extend (Lee et al., 2022, Theorem 4.1) to the Wasserstein distance of order one and weaker growth conditions. 9We assume that all probability measures admit densities w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure and that all the integrals we consider are well-defined. 32Under review as submission to TMLR Theorem I.1.Assume A1, A2, A4, A5 that T ≥2 ¯β(1+log(1+diam(M)), tK = T−εand ε,M,M/ζ,δ ≤1/32. Then, there existsD0 ≥0 such that W1(L(YK),π) ≤D0(Kζ + exp[κ/ε](M/ζ+ δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε1/2), with κ= diam(M)2(1 + ¯β)/2 and D0 = D(1 + ¯β)5(1 + d+ diam(M)4)(1 + log(1 + diam(M))), and D is a numerical constant. We start with the following lemma, which is an extension of Lemma D.5 to the setting whereA3 is replaced by A5. Lemma I.2. Assume A1, A2 and A5. Assume that there existsδ >0 such that for anyk ∈{0,...,K }, γkβT−tk/σ2 T−tk ≤δ. Assume that there existsη >0 such thatA(δ,M,η, diam(M)) >0 with A(δ,M,η, diam(M)) = 2 −2δ−32δ(1 + M2) −8M −4ηdiam(M), B(δ,M,η, diam(M)) = 32δ(M2 + diam(M)2) + 2(1 +δ)(diam(M)/η+ M) + 4d. Then, we have for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Yk∥2] ≤K = d+ B(δ,M,η, diam(M))(1/A(δ,M,η, diam(M)) + δ). In particular ifM ≤1/32 and δ≤1/32 then for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Yk∥2] ≤K0 = 5d+ 320(1 + diam(M))2. Proof. Recall that using (5), we have that for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} Yk+1 = Yk + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)1/2Zk, (61) For simplicity, we denote γ1,k = (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)/βT−tk, γ 2,k = (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)/(2βT−tk). Then, (61) can be rewritten for anyk∈{0,...,K −1}as Yk+1 = Yk + γ1,kβT−tk(Yk + 2s(T −tk,Yk)) + √ 2γ2,kβT−tkZk. (62) In what follows, we denote¯γ1,k = γ1,kβT−tk and ¯γ2,k = γ2,kβT−tk. In addition, using thatγkβT−tk ≤δ≤1/4, we have thatγ1,k ≤γ2,k ≤2γ1,k. Indeed, we have that for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} γ2,k/γ1,k = (1/2)(exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] + 1) ≥1, γ2,k/γ1,k = (1/2)(exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] + 1) ≤(1/2)(exp[γkβT−tk] + 1) ≤2, In what follows, for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd, we denote∆t = ∥s(t,xt) −∇log pt(xt)∥. Using Lemma C.1, we have that for anyt∈[0,T], xt ∈Rd and η >0 ⟨xt,s(t,xt)⟩≤−∥ xt∥2/σ2 t + mtdiam(M)∥xt∥/σ2 t + ∆t(xt)∥xt∥ ≤(−1 + ηmtdiam(M)) ∥xt∥2 /σ2 t + (mtdiam(M)/η)/σ2 t + ∆t(xt)∥xt∥, (63) where we have used that for anya,b ≥0, 2ab≤ηa2 + b2/η in the last line. In addition, using Lemma C.1, for anyt∈[0,T] and xt ∈Rd we have ∥s(t,xt)∥2 ≤2∥s(t,xt) −∇log pt(xt)∥2 + 2∥∇log pt(xt)∥2 ≤2∆t(xt)2 + 4∥xt∥2/σ4 t + 4m2 tdiam(M)2/σ4 t, (64) 33Under review as submission to TMLR In addition, usingA5, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and (63) we have E[⟨Yk,s(T −tk,Yk)⟩] ≤(−1 + ηmT−tkdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + (mT−tkdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−tk + E[∆T−tk(Yk)∥Yk∥] ≤(−1 + ηmT−tkdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + (mT−tkdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−tk + E1/2[∆T−tk(Yk)2]E1/2[∥Yk∥2] ≤(−1 + ηmT−tkdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + (mT−tkdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−tk + M(1 + E1/2[∥Yk∥2])E1/2[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk ≤(−1 + ηmT−tkdiam(M) + M)E[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + (mT−tkdiam(M)/η)/σ2 T−tk + ME1/2[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk ≤(−1 + ηmT−tkdiam(M) + 2M)E[∥Yk∥2]/σ2 T−tk + (mT−tkdiam(M)/η+ M)/σ2 T−tk. (65) Finally, usingA5 and (64) we have E[∥s(T −tk,Yk)∥2] ≤4E[∆T−tk(Yk)2] + 4E[∥Yk∥2]/σ4 T−tk + 4m2 T−tkdiam(M)2/σ4 T−tk ≤4M2(1 + E[∥Yk∥2])/σ4 T−tk + 4E[∥Yk∥2]/σ4 T−tk + 4m2 T−tkdiam(M)2/σ4 T−tk ≤4(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2])/σ4 T−tk + 4(M2 + m2 T−tkdiam(M)2)/σ4 T−tk. (66) Combining (62), (65) and (66) we have for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} E[∥Yk+1∥2] = (1 + ¯γ1,k)2E[∥Yk∥2] + 4¯γ2 1,kE[∥s(T −tk,Yk)∥2] + 4¯γ1,k(1 + ¯γ1,k)E[⟨Yk,s(T −tk,Yk)⟩] + 2¯γ2,kd ≤(1 + 2¯γ1,k + ¯γ2 1,k)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(M2 + m2 T−tkdiam(M)2) + 4¯γ1,k(1 + ¯γ1,k)E[⟨Yk,s(T −tk,Yk)⟩] + 4¯γ1,kd ≤(1 + 2¯γ1,k + ¯γ2 1,k)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(1 + M2)E[∥Yk∥2] + 16(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)2(M2 + m2 T−tkdiam(M)2) + 4(¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)(1 + ¯γ1,k)(−1 + 2M + ηmT−tkdiam(M))E[∥Yk∥2] + (¯γ1,k/σ2 T−tk)(1 + ¯γ1,k)(mT−tkdiam(M)/η+ M) + 4¯γ1,kd. The rest of the proof is identical to the one of Lemma D.5. Let ζ >0. For anyk∈{0,...,K }we defineAk such that Ak = {y∈Rd : ∥s(T −tk,y) −∇log pT−tk(y)∥>(M/ζ)/σ2 T−tk}. We define the process(Y⋆ k)k∈{0,...,K} such thatY⋆ 0 = Y0 and for anyk ∈{0,...,K −1}, if Yk = Y⋆ k and Yk ∈Ak then Y⋆ k+1 = Yk+1. Otherwise, we define Y⋆ k+1 = Y⋆ k + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)(Y⋆ k + 2∇log pT−tk(Y⋆ k)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)1/2Zk. This is similar to assuming that there existss⋆ such that for anyk∈{0,...,K −1} Y⋆ k+1 = Y⋆ k + (exp[ ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)(Y⋆ k + 2s⋆(T −tk,Y ⋆ k)) + (exp[2 ∫T−tk T−tk+1 βsds] −1)1/2Zk, with s⋆ which satisfies10 A3 withM replaced byM/ζ and whileYk ∈Ak, Y⋆ k+1 = Yk+1. We have the following lemma which is an extension of (Lee et al., 2022, Theorem 4.1) to the Wasserstein setting. Note that contrary to (Lee et al., 2022, Theorem 4.1) which states results in total variation we also need control on the moments of the distribution under aL2 error, which is precisely Lemma I.2. 10Note that we slightly abuse sinces⋆ is random (depending on the behavior ofYk) but one can check that all our proofs remain unchanged in this slightly larger setting 34Under review as submission to TMLR Lemma I.3. Assume A1, A2 and A5. Assume that there existsδ >0 such that for anyk ∈{0,...,K }, γkβT−tk/σ2 T−tk ≤δ and thatM,M/ζ,δ ≤1/32. Then, we have for anyk∈{0,...,K } E[∥Y⋆ k −Yk∥] ≤4(1 + K0)ζk, where K0 is defined in Lemma I.2. Proof. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have E[∥Y⋆ k −Yk∥] = E[∥Y⋆ k −Yk∥1 Yk̸=Y⋆ k ] ≤ √ 2(E1/2[∥Y⋆ k∥2] + E1/2[∥Yk∥2])(∑k j=1 P(Yj ∈Aj))1/2 ≤ √ 2(E1/2[∥Y⋆ k∥2] + E1/2[∥Yk∥2]) ×(∑k j=1 P(∥s(T −tj,Yj) −∇log pT−tj(Yj)∥>(M/ζ)/σ2 T−tj))1/2. (67) Using the Markov inequality, we have for anyj ∈{0,...,K } P(∥s(T −tj) −∇log pT−tj(Yj)∥>(M/ζ)/σ2 T−tj) ≤E[∥s(T −tj,Yj) −∇log pT−tj(Yj)∥2]σ4 T−tjζ2/M2 ≤ζ2E[1 + ∥Yj∥2]. Therefore, combining this result, (67) and Lemma I.2 we haveE[∥Y⋆ k −Yk∥] ≤4(1 + K0)ζk. We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem I.1 Proof. We have W1(L(YK),π) ≤W1(L(YK),L(Y⋆ k)) + W1(L(Y⋆ k),π). (68) Note that using Theorem 1 we have W1(L(Y⋆ k),π) ≤D0(exp[κ/ε](M/ζ+ δ1/2)/ε2 + exp[κ/ε] exp[−T/¯β] + ε1/2). (69) In addition, using Lemma I.3 we have W1(L(YK),L(Y⋆ k)) ≤4(1 + K0)ζK. Combining this result and (69) in (68) concludes the proof. J Improved bounds under Hessian conditions In Appendix J.1, we prove Theorem 3 which is an improvement upon Theorem 1 under tighter conditions on the Hessian∇2 log pt. In Appendix J.2, we show that this condition is satisfied in the case of a uniform measure over[−1/2,1/2]p for somep ∈{1,...,d }. Finally, in Appendix J.3, we show, under appropriate smoothness conditions, that the condition is never satisfied on non-convex sets. J.1 Proof of Theorem 3 In this section, we prove Theorem 3. We start by deriving an improvement on Proposition 6. The main difference between Proposition 6 and Proposition J.1 lies into the dependency w.r.t.σ−2 T−tK. In Proposition 6, we have an exponential dependencyexp[(diam(M)2/2)σ−2 T−tK] whereas in Proposition J.1, we have a polynomial dependencyσ−2Γ T−tK. For ease of notation we introduce the following assumption. A6. There existsΓ ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd, ∥∇2 log pt(xt)∥≤ Γ/σ2 t. We start with the following proposition. 35Under review as submission to TMLR Proposition J.1. Assume A1, A6 and thatT ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Let tK ∈[0,T). Then, for any t∈[0,tK] and x∈Rd we have ∥∇Yx t,tK∥≤ exp[−(1/2) ∫T−t T−t⋆ βsds1 [0,t⋆)(t)]σ−2Γ T−tK exp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−tK βudu]. Proof. Let x∈Rd. First, using (13) and Lemma C.2 we have that for anys,t ∈[0,T] with s≤t d∥∇Yx s,t∥2 ≤2βT−t(∥∇Yx s,t∥2 −2(1 −m2 T−tdiam(M)2/(2σ2 T−t))/σ2 T−t∥∇Yx s,t∥2)dt. First, assume thats≤t⋆ and thatt≥t⋆. In that case, using Lemma D.8 we have that ∫t⋆ s βT−u(1 −2/σ2 T−u + m2 T−udiam(M)2/σ4 T−u)du≤−(1/2) ∫t⋆ s βT−udu. Therefore, using that result and the fact that∇Yx s,s = Id we get that ∥∇Yx s,t⋆∥≤ exp[−(1/2) ∫T−s T−t⋆ βudu]. (70) In addition, using that for anyt∈(0,T] and xt ∈Rd, ∥∇2 log pt(xt)∥≤ Γ/σ2 t we have d∥∇Yx s,t∥2 ≤2βT−t(1 + 2Γ/σ2 T−t)∥∇Yx s,t∥2dt. In addition, using Lemma D.1 we have that ∫t t⋆ βT−u(1 + 2Γ/σ2 T−u)du≤Γ[log(exp[2 ∫T−t⋆ 0 βT−udu] −1) −log(exp[2 ∫T−t 0 βT−udu] −1)] + ∫T−t⋆ T−t βudu ≤Γ[log(σ2 T−t⋆) −log(σ2 T−t)] + (Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−t βudu ≤−Γ log(σ2 T−t) + (Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−t βudu. Therefore, combining this result and (70), we get that ∥∇Ys,t∥≤ σ−2Γ T−texp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−t βudu]∥∇Ys,t⋆∥ ≤σ−2Γ T−texp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−t βudu] exp[−(1/2) ∫T−s T−t⋆ βudu]. The proof in the cases wheres≥t⋆, t≥t⋆ and s≤t⋆, t≤t⋆ are similar and left to the reader. The rest of the proof follows the proof of Section 4. The following proposition is the counterpart of Proposition 10. Again note that the exponential dependency w.r.t.1/ε has been replaced by a polynomial dependency. Proposition J.2. . Assume A1, A2, A3, A4, A6 and tK = T −ε. In addition, assume thatε,δ,M ≤1/32. Then W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤D0(M + δ1/2)/εΓ+2, where D0 = 4(4 + 256d+ 43664(1 + diam(M))4) exp[3(1 + ¯β)2(Γ + 2)(1 + log(1 + diam(M))))]. Proof. Using Proposition 5, we have ∥YtK −YK∥≤ ∫tK 0 ∥∇Yu,tK( ¯Y0,u)∥∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du. Combining this result, recalling thatt⋆ is defined in (14) and Proposition J.1, we get ∥YtK −YK∥≤ ∫tK 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds1 [0,t⋆)(u)]σ−2Γ T−tK 36Under review as submission to TMLR ×exp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−tK βsds]∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥du ≤σ−2Γ T−tkexp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−tK βsds]( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])du + ∫tK t⋆ ∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])du). Using this result and Proposition 9 we get W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤E[∥YtK −YK∥] ≤σ−2Γ T−tKexp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−tK βsds]( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]E[∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥]du + ∫tK t⋆ E[∥∆bu(( ¯Y0,v)v∈[0,T])∥]du). ≤σ−2Γ T−tKexp[(Γ + 1) ∫T−t⋆ T−tK βsds]C0(T −tK + ¯β)2(M + δ1/2)/(T −tK)2 ×( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]du+ tK −t⋆) ≤σ−2Γ T−tKexp[(Γ + 1)¯β(tK −t⋆)ds]C0(T −tK + ¯β)2(M + δ1/2)/(T −tK)2 ×( ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]du+ tK −t⋆). (71) We have that ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(1/2) ∫T−u T−t⋆ βsds]du≤ ∫t⋆ 0 exp[−(t⋆ −u)/(2 ¯β)]du≤2 ¯β. (72) In addition, using (14) we have tK −t⋆ = T −ε−T + 2¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))) ≤2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M))). (73) Finally, using Lemma D.2, we have thatσ−2 T−tK ≤(1 + ¯β)/ε. Combining this result,(72) and (73) in (71) and that for anya≥0, 1 + a≤exp[a], we get W1(π∞QtK,π∞RK) ≤4(1 + ¯β)Γ+3(1 + log(1 + diam(M))) ×exp[2 ¯β2(Γ + 1)(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]C0(M + δ1/2)ε−(Γ+2) ≤4(1 + ¯β)Γ+3(1 + log(1 + diam(M))) ×exp[2 ¯β2(Γ + 1)(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]C0(M + δ1/2)ε−(Γ+2) ≤4 exp[3¯β2(Γ + 2)(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]C0(M + δ1/2)ε−(Γ+2), which concludes the proof. We now state the equivalent of Proposition D.9. Proposition J.3. Assume A1, A6 and T ≥2 ¯β(1 + log(1 + diam(M)). Then, for any x,y ∈Rd and t∈[0,tK] W1(δxQt,δyQt) ≤exp[2(Γ + 1)¯β2(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]σ−2Γ T−tK∥x−y∥. Proof. This is a direct consequence of (53), Proposition J.1 and (73). Finally, we controlW1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK). First, we have W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) = W1(π∞QtK,πPTQtK) (74) ≤exp[2(Γ + 1)¯β2(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]σ−2Γ T−tKW1(πPT,π∞). To controlW1(πPT,π∞), we use a synchronous coupling,i.e. we set(Yt,Zt)t∈[0,T] such that dYt = −βtYtdt+ √ 2βtdBt, dZt = −βtZtdt+ √ 2βtdBt, where (Bt)t∈[0,T] is ad-dimensional Brownian motion andY0 ∼π, Z0 ∼π∞. We have that for anyt∈[0,T], Zt ∼π∞. In addition, denotingut = E[∥Yt −Zt∥] for anyt∈[0,T], we have that dut ≤u0 exp[− ∫t 0 βsds]. 37Under review as submission to TMLR Therefore, combining this result and (74), we get that W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) ≤exp[2(Γ + 1)¯β2(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]σ−2Γ T−tK exp[− ∫T 0 βtdt]W1(π,π∞). Therefore, similarly as in the proof of Proposition 10, we have W1(π∞QtK,πPT−tK) ≤D1 exp[−T/¯β]/εΓ, with D1 = exp[2(Γ + 2)(1 + ¯β)2(1 + log(1 + diam(M)))]( √ d+ diam(M)). We conclude the proof of Theorem 3 upon combining this result, Proposition J.2 and (24). J.2 Hessian bounds for the uniform distribution The goal of this section is to prove the following result. Proposition J.4.Assume thatπ is the uniform distribution over[−1/2,1/2]p for somep∈{1,...,d }. Then, there existsΓ ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, ∥∇2 log pt(xt)∥≤ Γ/σ2 t. Proof. Let t∈(0,T]. We start by deriving a closed form expression forpt. We have for anyx∈Rd pt(x) = ∫ Mexp[−∥x−mtz∥2/(2σ2 t)]dπ(z)(2πσt)−d/2 = exp[−∑d i=p+1 x2 i/(2σ2 t)] ∏p i=1 ∫1/2 −1/2 exp[−(xi −mtzi)2/(2σ2 t)]dzi(2πσt)−d/2 = exp[−∑d i=p+1 x2 i/(2σ2 t)] ∏p i=1 ∫xi+mt/2 xi−mt/2 exp[−z2 i/(2σ2 t)]dzi(2πσt)−d/2m−p t = exp[−∑d i=p+1 x2 i/(2σ2 t)](2πσt)−d/2×∏p i=1 ∫(xi+mt/2)/σt (xi−mt/2)/σt exp[−z2 i/2]dzi(σt/mt)p = (2π)d/2(2πσt)−d/2(σt/mt)p∏d i=p+1 φ(xi/σt) ×∏p i=1{Φ((xi + mt/2)/σt) −Φ((xi −mt/2)/σt)}, where φ(t) = exp[−t2/2]/ √ 2π and Φ(t) = ∫t −∞φ(s)ds. Note that from this expression,∇2 log pt is diagonal. Hence, we only need to compute∂2 i log pt(x) for anyx∈Rd and i∈{1,...,d }. Let i∈{p+ 1,...,d }. We have for anyx∈Rd ∂2 i log pt(x) = −σ−2 t . We now turn to the case wherei∈{1,...,p }. In this case, we denoteFt(Φ,a,b ) = Φ(a+ b) −Φ(a−b) and we have ∂2 i log pt(x) = (1/σ2 t)∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,xi/σt,mt/σt). (75) We have that for anya,b ∈R with a̸= b ∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,a,b ) = Ft(φ′,a,b )/Ft(Φ,a,b ) −Ft(φ,a,b )2/Ft(Φ,a,b )2. (76) In what follows, we assume thata>b and we define for anyt∈R erfc(t) = 1 −(2/√π) ∫t 0 exp[−s2]ds. Note thatFt(Φ,a,b ) = (1/2)(erfc((a−b)/2) −erfc((a+ b)/2)). In addition, there existsC >0 such that for any t̸= 0 we have erfc(t) ≥exp[−t2]/(√πt)(1 + C/t2), erfc(t) ≤exp[−t2]/(√πt)(1 −/(Ct2)). In particular, we have Ft(Φ,a,b ) ≤exp[−(a−b)2/2]/( √ 2π(a−b))(1 + R0(a,b)), (77) Ft(Φ,a,b ) ≥exp[−(a−b)2/2]/( √ 2π(a−b))(1 − ¯R0(a,b)), 38Under review as submission to TMLR where R0(a,b) = C/(a−b)2 + exp[+(a−b)2/2 −(a+ b)2/2](a−b)/(a+ b)(1 −/(C(a+ b)2)), ¯R0(a,b) = −C/(a−b)2 + exp[+(a−b)2/2 −(a+ b)2/2](a−b)/(a+ b)(1 + C/(a+ b)2), Note that there existsC0 ≥0 such that for anya,b ∈R with a≥b+ 1 (R0(a,b) + ¯R0(a,b))(a−b)2 ≤C0. (78) In particular, there existsa0 ≥0 such that ifa≥b+ a0, ¯R0(a,b) + R0(a,b) ≤1/2. Similarly, we have Ft(φ,a,b ) = (2π)−1/2 exp[−(a−b)2/2](−1 + exp[−((a+ b)2 −(a−b)2)/2]). (79) We denoteR1(a,b) = exp[−((a+ b)2 −(a−b)2)/2] and note that there existsC1 ≥0 such that for any a,b ∈R with a≥b+ 1 R1(a,b)(a−b)2 ≤C1. (80) Finally, we have Ft(φ′,a,b ) = (2π)−1/2 exp[−(a−b)2/2](a−b)(1 + (a+ b)/(a−b) exp[−((a+ b)2 −(a−b)2)/2]). (81) We denoteR2(a,b) = (a+ b)/(a−b) exp[−((a+ b)2 −(a−b)2)/2] and note that there existsC2 ≥0 such that for anya,b ∈R with a≥b+ 1 R2(a,b)(a−b)2 ≤C2. (82) Combining (76), (77), (79) and (81), we get that for anya,b ∈R with a≥b+ 1 ∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,a,b ) ≤(a−b)2[(1 + R2(a,b))/(1 + ¯R0(a,b)) −(1 + R1(a,b))2/(1 + R0(a,b))2]. In addition, we have for anya,b ∈R with a≥b+ 1 (1 + R2(a,b))/(1 + ¯R0(a,b)) −(1 + R1(a,b))2/(1 + R0(a,b))2 = (R2(a,b)(1 + R0(a,b))2 −R1(a,b)(1 + ¯R0(a,b)))/[(1 + ¯R0(a,b))2(1 + ¯R0(a,b))]. Combining this result, (78), (80) and (82), we get that for anya,b ∈R with a≥b+ a0 R2(a,b)(1 + R0(a,b))2 −R1(a,b)(1 + ¯R0(a,b) ≤4(C1 + C2)/(a−b)2. Therefore, there existsC3 ≥0 such that for anya≥b+ a0, |∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,a,b )|≤ C3. Similarly there exists C4 ≥0 such that ifa≤−b−a0, |∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,a,b )|≤ C4. By symmetry, there existsC5 ≥0 such that for any b≥a+ a0 or −b≥−a−a0, we have|∂2 2 log Ft(Φ,a,b )|≤ C5 and we conclude by continuity that there exists C ≥0 such that for anya,b ∈R, ∂2 log Ft(Φ,a,b ) ≤C, which concludes the proof upon combining this result with (75). J.3 The role of convexity In this section, for anyx∈Rd, we definefx : M→ R+ given for anyy ∈M by fx(y) = ∥x−y∥2. Before giving our main result we need to introduce a few useful tools. For any subsetX ⊂Rd and x ∈Rd we defineP(x) = {y ∈X : d(x,X) = d(x,y)}. Note thatP(x) can be empty. We say that a setX is Chebyshev if for allx∈Rd, there existsp(x) ∈X such thatP(x) = {p(x)}, i.e. Chebyshev sets are the subsets ofRd such that each point admits a unique projection onX. It is clear that all closed and convex sets are Chebyshev sets. Note that all Chebyshev sets are closed since for any Chebyshev set X and x∈∂X (the frontier ofX) we have that there existsp(x) ∈X such thatd(x,p(x)) = d(x,X) = 0, i.e. x∈X. In addition, Chebyshev sets are also convex, see (Kritikos, 1938; Motzkin, 1935; Bundt, 1934). This result implies the following proposition. 39Under review as submission to TMLR Proposition J.5. Let X ⊂Rd. X is a closed convex set if and only ifX is a Chebyshev set. In order to prove our main result, we introduce some basics onMorse theory. Assume thatMis a smooth manifold andf ∈C∞(M,R). We say thatx∈M is a non-degenerate minimizer ifx∈M is a minimizer of f and the Hessian off at x is not singular. We then have the following proposition (see (Matsumoto, 2002) for instance). Proposition J.6.Let f ∈C∞(M,R) and x∈M a non degenerate minimizer off. Then there existU ⊂M open andφ: U →φ(U) ⊂Rp a local chart such thatφ(x) = 0 and for anyˆy∈φ(U) f(φ−1(ˆy)) = f(x) + ∥ˆy∥2. In addition, we haveDφ(x) = ∇2f(x). Note that upon consideringφ−1(φ(U)/2) instead ofU we can always assume thatφ−1 has bounded derivatives. Finally, we introduce the concept ofshape operator(also calledsecond fundamental formor Weingarten form), see (Bishop and Crittenden, 2011). We assume that the metric onMis the induced Euclidean metric. Let N ∈Γ(TM⊤) a section on the normal bundleTM⊤. We defineAN : Γ(TM)2 →C∞(M) such that for any V1,V2 ∈Γ(TM) AN(V1,V2) = −⟨V1,∇V2 N⟩. Note thatAN is symmetric, linear and the scalar product and covariant derivative∇are considered w.r.t. the ambient Euclidean metric. The shape operator encodes the local geometry ofM. For example in the case ofSd−1, we have that for anyN ∈Γ(TM⊤) and V1,V2 ∈Γ(TM) AN(V1,V2) = −⟨V1,V2⟩⟨N0,N⟩, (83) where N0 is the normal vector field pointing outward of the sphere, see (Absil et al., 2013). We have the following result, see (Bishop and Crittenden, 2011, Theorem 3) and (Bishop, 1974). Proposition J.7. If Mis convex then for anyN ∈Γ(TM⊤) such that for anyx,y ∈M, ⟨y−x,N(x)⟩≥ 0, AN is non-negative. Finally, let ¯f ∈C∞(Rd,R) and f its restriction toM. Using (Absil et al., 2013), we have for anyV1,V2 ∈ Γ(TM) ∇2f(V1,V2) = ⟨V1,Π(∇2 ¯f(V2))⟩+ AΠ⊤(∇¯f)(V1,V2), (84) where for anyx∈M, Πx is the orthogonal projection operator onTxM. We are now ready to state our main result. Theorem J.8. Assume thatM⊂ Rd is a smooth manifold and thatπ admits a smooth density w.r.t. the Hausdorff measure onM. The following hold: (a) If Mis convex then for anyx∈M we havelim supt→0 σ2 t∥∇2 log pt(mtx)∥<+∞. (b) If there existsx ∈Rd such that |P(x)|> 1 and for anyp(x) ∈P(x), Ap(x)−x p(x) ≻− Id. Then, we have lim inft→0 σ4 t∥∇2 log pt(mtx)∥>0. Theorem J.8 implies that one can obtain information about the geometry ofMby computing the Hessian of the logarithmic gradient of the densities of(L(Xt))t∈[0,T]. In the convex case the scaling w.r.t.σt is of order σ−2 t whereas in the second scenario the scaling is of orderσ−4 t . Note that the condition “there existsx∈Rd such that|P(x)|>1” is equivalent to assuming thatMis not a Chebyshev set and hence a non convex set in virtue of Proposition J.5. Therefore in Theorem J.8-(b), we assume thatMis non convex and a curvature condition. The condition Ap(x)−x x ≻− Id implies that the manifold is not too “negatively curved” at the projection points. The non-strict inequality is always true,i.e. for anyp(x) ∈P(x), Ap(x)−x x ⪰−Id since ∇2fx(p(x)) ⪰0. We conjecture that this curvature condition can be relaxed. Indeed, it is not satisfied in the case where M= {x ∈Rd : ∥x∥= 1}, since the only pointx ∈Rd such that |P(x)|> 1 is x = 0 and in that case 40Under review as submission to TMLR P(x) = Mand therefore∇2f0 = 0, which implies that for anyx∈M, Ax x = −Id. This formula could also have been obtained from(83). However, one can show that we still havelim inft→0 σ4 t∥∇2 log pt(0)∥>0. In future works, we would like to relax these curvature conditions assuming that the manifold has an analytic structure and using results from (Combet, 2006). Finally, we highlight that Theorem J.8-(a) is weaker than the conditionA6. To bridge the gap between Theorem J.8-(a) andA6 one would need to strengthen Theorem J.8-(a) to deriveuniform in spacebounds. This would require to usequantitative version of the Morse lemmas, see (Le Loi and Phien, 2014) for instance. We postpone this study to future works. However, Theorem J.8-(b) implies thatA6 does not hold. Hence, any non convex set which is not too “negatively curved” does not satisfyA6. Proof. (a) First, we assume thatMis convex. We show that for anyx∈Rd and p(x) ∈P(x), ∇2fx(p(x)) ≻0, i.e.theHessianof fx isnotdegenerate. Forany x∈Rd, wedefine ¯fx suchthatforany y∈Rd, ¯fx(y) = ∥x−y∥2. Using (84), we have for anyx∈Rd ∇2fx(p(x)) = Id +Ap(x)−x ⪰Id ≻0. (85) Since Mis convex for anyx∈Rd, P(x) = {p(x)}and note thatP(x) is the set of minimizers offx. Let x∈Rd. Using Proposition J.6 and(85), there existU ⊂M open andφ: U →φ(U) ⊂Rp a local chart such that φ(p(x)) = 0 and for anyˆy∈φ(U) ∥x−φ−1(ˆy)∥2 = ∥x−p(x)∥2 + ∥ˆy∥2, (86) with φ−1(0) = p(x). Note thatDφ−1(0) = (∇2fx(p(x)))−1. For anyt∈(0,T], denoteλt = mt/σt. Using (86), we have that ∫ U2 (y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1) = ∫ φ−1(U)2 (φ−1(ˆy0) −φ−1(ˆy1))⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥ˆy0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0)dˆπ1(ˆy1) ×exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2] = (1/λt)2p∫ λtφ−1(U)2 (φ−1(ˆy0/λt) −φ−1(ˆy1/λt))⊗2 exp[−∥ˆy0∥2/2] exp[−∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0)dˆπ1(ˆy1) ×exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2], where ˆπ= φ#π admits a positive density w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. Therefore, there existsC0 ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] (2π/λ2 t)−p∥ ∫ U2 (y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1)∥ ≤C0(2π)−pσ2 t ∫ (Rp)2 ∥ˆy0 −ˆy1∥2 exp[−∥ˆy0∥2/2] exp[−∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆy0dˆy1 ×exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2] ≤2C0pσ2 t exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2], (87) where we have used that∥a−b∥2 ≤2(∥a∥2 + ∥b∥2) for anya,b ∈Rp in the last line. In addition, sinceU is open we have thatM∩Uc is compact and since for anyy∈M∩ Uc, ∥y−x∥2 >∥p(x) −x∥2, there exists ε> 0 such that for anyy∈M∩ Uc, ∥y−x∥2 ≥∥p(x) −x∥2 + ε. Therefore, we have ∥ ∫ (M∩Uc)2 (y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1)∥ ≤diam(M)2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2] exp[−ε(mt/σt)2]. (88) Combining (87) and (88) there existsC1 ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] (2π/λ2 t)−p∥ ∫ M2 (y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1)∥ ≤C1σ2 t exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2]. (89) In addition, there existsC2 >0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] (2π/λ2 t)−p∫ U exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y∥2/2]dπ(y) ≥(1/C2) exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2]. (90) 41Under review as submission to TMLR Therefore, combining (89) and (90), we get that there existsC3 ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] ∥ ∫ M(y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1)∥ /( ∫ Mexp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y∥2/2]dπ(y))2 ≤C3σ2 t. We conclude the proof in the convex case upon combining this result and Lemma C.2. (b) Second, we assume that there existsx∈Rd such that|P(x)|>1 and for anyp(x) ∈P(x), Ap(x)−x ≻−Id. Using (84), we have for anyp(x) ∈P(x) ∇2fx(p(x)) = Id +Ap(x)−x ≻0. Using this fact and thatP(x) is the set of minimizers offx and is compact, we get that|P(x)|<+∞. Hence, we assume thatP(x) = {pi(x)}N i=1 with N >1. Using Proposition J.6, for anyi∈{1,...,N }, there exist Ui ⊂M open andφi : Ui →φi(Ui) ⊂Rp a local chart such thatφi(pi(x)) = 0 and for anyˆy∈φi(Ui) ∥x−φ−1 i (ˆy)∥2 = ∥x−pi(x)∥2 + ∥ˆy∥2, with φ−1 i (0) = pi(x). Note thatDφ−1 i (0) = (∇2fx(pi(x)))−1. Without loss of generality we assume that for any i,j ∈{1,...,N }, Ui ∩Uj = ∅. We have that ∫ U0×U1 (y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1) = ∫ φ−1 0 (U0)×φ−1 1 (U1)(φ−1 0 (ˆy0) −φ−1 1 (ˆy1))⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥ˆy0∥2/2] ×exp[−(mt/σt)2∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0)dˆπ1(ˆy1) exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2] = (1/λt)2p∫ λtφ−1 0 (U0)×λtφ−1 1 (U1)(φ−1 0 (ˆy0/λt) −φ−1 1 (ˆy1/λt))⊗2 ×exp[−∥ˆy0∥2/2] exp[−∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0)dˆπ1(ˆy1) exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2]. (91) In addition, using the dominated convergence theorem we have lim t→+∞ (2π)−p∫ λtφ−1 0 (U0)×λtφ−1 1 (U1)(φ−1 0 (ˆy0/λt) −φ−1 1 (ˆy1/λt))⊗2 (92) ×exp[−∥ˆy0∥2/2] exp[−∥ˆy1∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0)dˆπ1(ˆy1) = ˆh0(p0(x))ˆh1(p1(x))(p0(x) −p1(x))⊗2, where ˆhi is the density ofˆπi = (φi)#π w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. In addition, there existsC4 ≥0 such that for anyt∈(0,T] (2π)−p/2 ∫ U0 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2]dπ(y0) = (2π)−p/2 ∫ φ−1 0 (U0) exp[−(mt/σt)2∥ˆy0∥2/2]dˆπ(ˆy0) exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2] ≤C4 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2]λp/2 t . (93) In addition, sinceU0 is open we have thatM∩Uc 0 is compact and since for anyy ∈M∩ Uc 0, ∥y−x∥2 > ∥p(x) −x∥2, there existsε> 0 such that for anyy∈M∩ Uc 0, ∥y−x∥2 ≥∥p(x) −x∥2 + ε. Therefore, we have ∫ M∩Uc 0 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2]dπ(y0) ≤C5 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2/2] exp[−ε(mt/σt)2]. Combining this result and (93), we get that there existsC6 >0 such that (2π/λ2 t)−p/2∫ Mexp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2]dπ(y0) ≤C6 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−p(x)∥2/2]. Combining this result, (91) and (92), there existsC7 >0 such that lim inf t→0 ∫ M(y0 −y1)⊗2 exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y0∥2/2] exp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y1∥2/2]dπ(y0)dπ(y1) /( ∫ Mexp[−(mt/σt)2∥x−y∥2/2]dπ(y))2 ≥(x0 −x1)⊗2/C6. We conclude upon combining this result and Lemma C.2. 42",

Sco re-based generative modeling (SGM) is one empirically successful approach that implicitly learns the probability distribution by learning how to transform white noise into the data distribution, and gives state-of-the-art performance for generating images and audio [SE19; Dat+19; Gra+19; SE20; Son+20b; Men+21; Son+2 1b; Son+21a; Jin+22]. It also yields a conditional generation process for inverse problems [DN21]. The basic idea behind score-based generative modeling is to ﬁrst estimate the score function from data [Son+20a] and then to sample the distribution based on the learned score function. Other approaches for gene rative modeling include generative adver- sarial networks (GANs) [Goo+14; ACB17], normalizing ﬂows [DSB16], v ariational autoencoders [KW19], and energy-based models [ZML16]. While score-based generative mo deling has achieved great success, its theoretical analysis is still lacking and is the focus of our work. 1.1 Background General framework. The score function of a distribution P with density p is deﬁned as the gradient of the log-pdf, ∇ln p. Its signiﬁcance arises from the fact that knowing the score func tion allows running a variety of sampling algorithms, based on discretizations of stocha stic diﬀerential equations (SDE’s), to sample from p. SGM consists of two steps: ﬁrst, learning an estimate of the scor e function for a sequence of “noisy” versions of the data distribution Pdata, and second, using the score function in lieu of the gradient of the log-pdf in the chosen sampling algorithm. We now describe each of these steps more precisely. 1First, a method of adding noise to the data distribution is ﬁxed; this t akes the form of evolving a (forward) stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) starting from t he data distribution. We ﬁx a sequence of noise levels σ1 <··· <σ N. For σ ∈{σ1,...,σ N}, let the resulting distributions be Pσ2 and the distributions conditional on the starting data point be Pσ2 (·|x). Typically, σ1 is chosen so that Pσ2 1 ≈Pdata and Pσ2 N is close to some “prior” distribution that is easy to sample from, such a s N(0,σ 2 NId). While the score ∇ln pσ2 cannot be estimated directly, it turns out that a de-noising objective that is equivalent to the score-matching objective can be calculated [SE19]. This de-noising objective can be e stimated from samples ( X, ˜X) where ˜X ∼Pσ2 (·|x). The objective is represented and optimized within an expressive f unction class, typically neural networks, to obtain a L2-estimate of the score, that is, sθ(x,σ 2) such that Ex∼Pσ 2 [∥sθ(x,σ 2) −∇ln pσ2 (x)∥2] (1) is small. The reason we estimate the score function ∇ln pσ2 is that there are a variety of sampling algorithms— based on simulating SDE’s—that can sample from pgiven access to ∇ln p, including Langevin Monte Carlo and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The second step is then to use the estim ated score function sθ(x,t ) in lieu of the exact gradient in the sampling algorithm to successively obtain samples from pσ2 N ,...,p σ2 1 . This sequence interpolates smoothly between the prior distribution (e.g., N(0,σ 2 NId)) and the data distribution Pdata; such an “annealing” or “homotopy” method is required in practice to gene rate good samples [Son+20b]. Examples of SGM’s. There have been several instantiations of this general approach. [SE19] add gaussian noise to the data and then use Langevin diﬀusion at a discrete set ofnoise levels σN >··· >σ 1 as the sampling algorithm. [Son+20b] take the continuous perspective and conside r a more general framework, where the forward process can be any reasonable SDE. Then a natural reverse SDE evolves the ﬁnal distribution pσ2 N back to the data distribution; this process can be simulated with theestimated score. They consider methods based on two diﬀerent SDE’s: score-matching Langevin diﬀusion (SM LD) based on adding Gaussian noise and denosing diﬀusion probabilistic models (DDPM) [Soh+15; HJA20], ba sed on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Note that a diﬀerence with MCMC-based methods is that t hese SDE’s are evolved for a ﬁxed amount of time, rather than until convergence. However, they can be combined with MCMC-based methods such as Langevin diﬀusion in the predictor-corrector approach for improved convergence. [DVK21] include Hamiltonian dynamics: they augment the state space with a velocity v ariable and consider a critically- damped version of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we not e the work of [De +21], who introduce the Diﬀusion Schr¨ odinger Bridge method to learn a diﬀusion that more quickly transforms the prior into the data distribution. We will give a general analysis framework for SGM’s that applies to the algorithms in both [SE19] and [Son+20b]. 1.2 Prior work and challenges for theory Although the literature on convergence for Langevin Monte Carlo [D M17; CB18; Che+18; Dal17; DK19; MMS20; EHZ21] and related sampling algorithms is extensive, prior wo rks mainly consider the case of exact or stochastic gradients. In contrast, by the structure of the lo ss function (1), the score function learned in SGM is only accurate in L2(p). This poses a signiﬁcant challenge for analysis, as the stationary d istribution of Langevin diﬀusion with L2(p)-accurate gradient can be arbitrarily far from p (see Appendix D). Hence, any analysis must be utilizing the short/medium-term convergence, while overcoming the potential issue of long-term behavior of convergence to an incorrect distribution. [BMR20] give the ﬁrst theoretical analysis of SGM, and in particular, Langevin Monte Carlo with L2(p)- accurate gradients. First, they show using uniform generalization bounds that optimizing the de-noising autoencoder (DAE) objective does in fact give a L2(p)-accurate score function, with sample complexity depending on the complexity of the function class. They analyze con vergence of LMC in Wasserstein dis- tance. However, the error they obtain (Theorem 13) only decrea ses as ε1/d where ε is the accuracy of the score estimate—so it suﬀers from the curse of dimensionality—and in creases exponentially in the time that 2the process is run, the dimension, and the smoothness of the distr ibution, as in ODE/SDE discretization arguments that do not depend on contractivity. [De +21] give an analysis for [Son+20b] in TV distance that requires a L∞-accurate score function and depends exponentially on the amount of time the reverse SDE is run. Although exponential dependence is bad in general, it is molliﬁed using their Diﬀusion Schr¨ odinger Bridge (DSB) approach, as it allows running for a shorter, ﬁxed amount of time, before the forward SDE conv erges to the prior distribution. However, this supposes that a good solution can be found for the DSB problem , and theoretical guarantees may be diﬃcult to obtain. We overcome the challenges of analysis with a L2(p)-accurate gradient, and give the ﬁrst analysis with only polynomial dependence on running time, dimension, and smoothness of the distribution, with rates that are a ﬁxed power of ε. Our convergence result is in TV distance. We assume only smoothne ss conditions and a bounded log-Sobolev constant of the data distribution, a wea ker condition than the dissipativity condition required by [BMR20]. We introduce a general framework for analysis of sampling algorithms given L2-accurate gradients (score function) based on constructing a “ bad set” with small measure and showing convergence of the discretized process conditioned on not hitting the bad set. We use our framework to give an end-to-end analysis for both the algorithms in [SE19] and [Son +20b], and illuminate the relative performance of diﬀerent methods in practice. 1.3 Notation and organization Through out the paper, p(x) ∝e−V(x) denotes the target distribution in Rd and V : Rd →R is referred to as the potential. We abuse notation by identifying a measure with it s density when context allows. We write a∧b := min{a,b }and a∨b := max{a,b }. We use a = O(b) or b = Ω(a) to indicate that a ≤Cb for a universal constant C >0. Also, we write a = Θ(b) if there are universal constants c′ > c >0 such that cb≤a≤cb, and the notation ˜O(·) means it hides polylog factors in the parameters. Deﬁnite integrals without limits are taken over Rd. In Section 2 we explain our main results for Langevin Monte Carlo with L2(p)-accurate score estimate and use it to derive convergence bounds for the annealed LMC meth od of [SE19]. In Section 3, we give our main results for the predictor-corrector algorithms of [Son+20b] based on simulating reverse SDE’s. Our proofs are based on a common framework which we introduce in Sect ion 4. Full proofs are in the appendix. 2 Results for Langevin dynamics with estimated score Let p(x) ∝e−V(x) be a probability density on Rd such that V is C1. Langevin diﬀusion with stationary distribution p is the stochastic process deﬁned by the SDE dxt = −∇V(xt) dt+ √ 2 dwt, where wt is a standard Brownian Motion in Rd. The rate of convergence to p in χ2 and KL divergences are given by the Poincar´ e and log-Sobolev constants ofp, respectively; see Section E.1. To obtain the Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, we take the Euler-Murayama discretization of the SDE. We deﬁne LMC with score estimate s(x) ≈−∇V(x) and step size h by x(k+1)h = xkh + h·s(xkh) + √ 2h·ξkh, where ξkh ∼N(0,I d). (LMC-SE) We make the following assumptions on the density pand the score estimate s, which we will use throughout this paper. Assumption 1. p is a probability density on Rd such that the following hold. 1. ln p is C1 and L-smooth, that is, ∇ln p is L-Lipschitz. We assume L≥1. 2. p satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant CLS. We assume CLS ≥1. 33. (Moments) ∥Epx∥≤ M1 and Ep∥x∥2 ≤M2. We note that the uniform Lipschitzness assumption (1) helps ensur e a unique strong solution to the Langevin diﬀusion, as in [BMR20]. One special case where one can prov e Lipschitzness for all tis when p0 is strongly log-concave [Lee+21, Lemma 28]. Although satisfying a log-Sobolev inequality (3) is a signiﬁcant as- sumption, it is standard for analysis of Langevin Monte Carlo [VW19].It is much weaker than assumptions in previous works [BMR20], including log-concave distributions and distributions satisfying strong dissipativity, and is stable under bounded perturbations. See Section E.1 for bac kground on functional inequalities. Assumption 2. Let pbe a given probability density on Rd such that ln pis C1. The score estimate s: Rd → Rd satisﬁes the following. 1. s is a C1 function that is Ls-Lipschitz. We assume Ls ≥1. 2. The error in the score estimate is bounded in L2: ∥∇ln p−s∥2 L2(p) = Ep[∥∇ln p(x) −s(x)∥2] ≤ε2. 2.1 Langevin with L2-accurate score estimate Our ﬁrst main result gives an error bound between the sampled distr ibution and p, assuming L2-accurate score function estimate. Theorem 2.1 (LMC with L2-accurate score estimate) . Let p : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1(1, 2) with L≥1 and s: Rd →Rd be a score estimate satisfying Assumption 2(2). Consider the accuracy requirement in TV and χ2: 0 < εTV < 1, 0 < εχ < 1, and suppose furthermore the starting distribution satisﬁes χ2(p0||p) ≤K2 χ. Then if ε= O ( εTVε3 χ dL2C5/2 LS (ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∨Kχ) ) , (2) then running (LMC-SE) with score estimate s, step size h = Θ ( ε2 χ dL2CLS ) , and time T = Θ ( CLS ln (2Kχ ε2 χ ) ) results in a distribution pT such that pT is εTV-far in TV distance from a distribution pT, where pT satisﬁes χ2(pT||p) ≤ε2 χ. In particular, taking εχ = εTV, we have the error guarantee that TV(pT,p ) ≤2εTV. Note that the error bound is only achieved when running LMC for a mo derate time; this is consistent with the fact that the stationary distribution of LMC with a L2-score estimate can be arbitrarily far from p. Note also that we need a warm start in χ2-divergence: to obtain ﬁxed errors εTV,ε χ, the required accuracy for the score estimate is inversely proportional to Kχ. Intuitively, we must suﬀer from such a dependence because if the starting distribution is very far away, then there is n o guarantee that ∥∇ln p(xt) −s(xt)∥2 is small on average during the sampling algorithm. Finally, although we ca n state a result purely in terms of TV distance, we need this more precise formulation to prove a result for annealed Langevin dynamics. 2.2 Annealed Langevin dynamics with estimated score In light of the warm start requirement in Theorem 2.1, we typically can not directly sample from pdata or its approximation. Hence, [SE19] proposed using annealed Langevin dynamics: consider a sequence of noise levels σN >··· >σ 1 ≈0 giving rise to a sequence of distributions pσ2 N ,...,p σ2 1 ≈pdata, where pσ2 = p∗ϕσ2 , ϕσ2 being the density of N(0,σ 2Id). For large enough σN, ϕσ2 N ≈pσ2 N provides a warm start to pσ2 N . We then successively run LMC using score estimates for pσ2 k , with the approximate sample for pσ2 k giving a warm start for pσ2 k−1 . We obtain the following algorithm and error estimate. 4Algorithm 1 Annealed Langevin dynamics with estimated score [SE19] INPUT: Noise levels 0 ≤σ1 < ... < σ M; score function estimates s(·,σ m) (estimates of ∇ln(p∗ϕσ2m )), step sizes hm, and number of steps Nm for 1 ≤m≤M. Draw x(M+1) ∼N(0,σ 2 MId). for m from M to 1 do Starting from x(m) 0 = x(m+1), run (LMC-SE) with s(x,σ m) and step size hm for Nm steps, and let the ﬁnal sample be x(m). end for OUTPUT: Return x(1), approximate sample from p∗ϕσ2 1 . Theorem 2.2 (Annealed LMC with L2-accurate score estimate) . Let p : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 for M1 = O(d), and let pσ2 := p∗ϕσ2 . Suppose furthermore that ∇ln pσ2 is L- Lipschitz for every σ ≥0. Given σmin > 0, there exists a sequence σmin = σ1 < ··· < σM with M = O (√ dlog ( dCLS σ2 min )) such that for each m, if  ∇ln(pσ2m ) −s(·,σ 2 m)  2 L2(pσ 2m ) = Epσ 2m [  ∇ln pσ2m (x) −s(x,σ 2 m)  2 ] ≤ε2. with ε:= ˜O ( ε4.5 TV d3.25L2C2.5 LS ) (3) then x(1) is a sample from a distribution q such that TV(q,p σ2 1 ) ≤εTV. Note that we assume a score estimate with errorεat all noise scales; this corresponds to using an objective function that is a maximum of the score-matching objective over all noise levels, rather than an average over all noise levels as more commonly used in practice. However, these tw o losses are at most a factor of M apart. The proof shows that the noise levels σk can be chosen as a geometric sequence, which matches the choice used in practice [SE20]. The additional dependence on dand εTV in Theorem 2.2 compared to Theorem 2.1 comes from requiring a sequence of ˜O( √ d) noise levels and an additional factor in χ2-divergence we suﬀer at the beginning of each level m. In the next section, we will ﬁnd that using a reverse SDE to evolve t he samples between the noise levels—called a predictor step—will improve the rate and time complexity. 3 Results for reverse SDE’s with estimated score To improve the empirical performance of score-based generative modeling, [Son+20b] consider a general framework where noise is injected into a data distribution pdata via a forward SDE, d˜xt = f(˜xt,t ) dt+ g(t) dwt, t ∈[0,T ], where ˜x0 ∼˜p0 := pdata. Let ˜pt denote the distribution of ˜xt (˜pt is used instead of pt to distinguish with the Gaussian-convolved distribution used in Annealed Langevin dyna mics as in §2.2). Remarkably, ˜xt also satisﬁes a reverse-time SDE, d˜xt = [f(˜xt,t ) −g(t)2∇ln ˜pt(˜xt)]dt+ g(t) d˜wt, t ∈[0,T ], (4) where ˜wt is a backward Brownian Motion [And82]. By carefully choosing f and g, we can expect that ˜pT is approximately equal to some prior distribution ˜ qT (e.g., a centered Gaussian) which we can accurately sample from. Then we hope that starting with some ˜ yT ∼pprior = ˜qT ≈˜pT and running the reverse-time process, we will get a good sample ˜y0 ∼˜q0 ≈pdata. The case where f ≡0 and g≡1 recovers the simple case of convolving with a Gaussian as used in §2.2; note, however that the reverse-time SDE diﬀers from Langevin diﬀusion in having a larger (and time-varying) 5drift relative to the diﬀusion. [Son+20b] highlight the following two spe cial cases. We will focus on DDPM while noting that our analysis applies more generically. SMLD Score-matching Langevin diﬀusion : f ≡0. In this case, ˜pt = ˜p0 ∗ϕ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds, so [Son+20b] call this a variance-exploding (VE) SDE. As is common for annealing-base d algorithms, [SE19; Son+20b] suggest choosing an exponential schedule, so that g(t) = abt for constants a,b . We take pprior = N(0, ∫T 0 g(s)2 ds·Id). DDPM Denoising diﬀusion probabilistic modeling : f(x,t ) = −1 2 g(t)2x. This is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with time rescaling, ˜pt = M− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds♯˜p0 ∗ϕ1−e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds , where Mα(x) = αx. [Son+20b] call this a variance-preserving (VP) SDE, as the variance converg es towards Id. Because it displays exponential convergence towards N(0,I d), it can be run for a smaller amount of normalized time∫t 0 g(s)2 ds. [Son+20b] suggest the choice g(t) = √ b+ αt. We take pprior = N(0, (1−e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds)Id) ≈ N(0,I d). To obtain an algorithm, we consider the following discretization and ap proximation of (4); note that in all cases of interest the integrals can be analytically evaluated. We rev erse time so that t corresponds to T −t of the forward process. As we are free to rescale time in the SDE, w e assume without loss of generality that the step sizes are constant. The predictor step is z(k+1)h = zkh − ∫ (k+1)h kh [ f(zkh,T −t) −g(T −t)2 ·s(zkh,T −kh) ] dt + ∫ (k+1)h kh g(T −t) dwt, (P) where ∫(k+1)h kh g(T −t) dwt is distributed as N(0, ∫(k+1)h kh g(T −t)2 dt·Id). Following [Son+20b], we call these predictor steps as the samples aim to track the distributions ˜pT−kh. Note that we ﬂip the time. For simplicity of presentation, we consider the case g≡1. We note that although the choice of the schedule does matter in practice, what really matters in our theoretical analysis is the integral ∫t 0 g(s)2ds. This means that diﬀerent choices of g are related by only a rescaling of time, i.e., for diﬀerent g and ˜g, we can always choose total times T and ˜T, such that ∫T 0 g(s)2ds = ∫˜T 0 ˜g(s)2ds. While it seems that choosing large g(t) could reduce the total time T, in our analysis (e.g., Lemma C.15) we need the time step-size h to be O(1/g (T)2) and hence the total computational cost, which is roughly O(T/h ), does not change signiﬁcantly. Theorem 3.1 (Predictor with L2-accurate score estimate, DDPM) . Let pdata : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 with M2 = O(d), and let ˜pt be the distribution resulting from evolving the forward SDE according to DDPM with g ≡1. Suppose furthermore that ∇ln ˜pt is L-Lipschitz for every t≥0, and that each s(·,t ) satisﬁes Assumption 2. Then if ε= O ( ε4 TV (CLS + d)C5/2 LS (L∨Ls)2(ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln(1/ε 2 TV)) ) , running (P) starting from pprior for time T = Θ ( ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln ( 1 εTV )) and step size h= Θ ( ε2 TV CLS(CLS+d)(L∨Ls)2 ) results in a distribution qT so that TV(qT,p data) ≤εTV. A more precise statement of the Theorem can be found in the Appen dix. Although we state our theorem for DDPM, we describe in Appendix C how it can be adapted to other SD E’s like SMLD and the sub-VP SDE; the primary SDE-dependent bound we need is a bound on ∇ln ˜pt ˜pt+h . Because the predictor is tracking a changing distribution pt, we incur more error terms and worse dependence on parameters (CLS,L ) than in LMC (Theorem 2.1). Motivated by this, we intersperse the predictor steps with LMC steps—called corrector steps in this context—to give additional time for the process to mix, resulting in improved dependence on parameters. 6Algorithm 2 Predictor-corrector method with estimated score [Son+20b] INPUT: Time T, predictor step size h; number of corrector steps Nm per predictor step, corrector step sizes hm Draw z0 ∼pprior from the prior distribution. for m from 1 to T/h do (Predictor) Take a step of (P) to obtain zmh from z(m−1)h, with f,g as in SMLD or DDPM. (Corrector) Starting from zmh,0 := zmh, run (LMC-SE) with s(z,T −mh) and step size hm for N steps, and let zmh ←zmh,N. end for OUTPUT: Return zT, approximate sample from pdata. Theorem 3.2 (Predictor-corrector with L2-accurate score estimate). Keep the setup of Theorem 3.1. Then for ε3 TV = O ( 1 (1+Ls/L)2(1+CLS/d)(ln(CLSd)∨CLS) ) , if ε= O ( ε4 TV dL2C5/2 LS ln(1/ε 2 χ) ) , (5) then Algorithm 2 with appropriate choices of T = Θ ( ln(CLSd) ∨CLS log ( 1 εTV )) , Nm, corrector step sizes hm and predictor step size h, produces a sample from a distribution qT such that TV(qT,p data) <εTV. The assumption on εTV is for convenience in stating our bound. In comparison to using the p redictor step alone (Theorem 3.1), note that in the bound on ε, we obtain the improved rate of the corrector step as in Theorem 2.1; this is because the predictor step only needs to track the actual distribution in χ2-divergence with error O(1), and the ﬁnal corrector steps are responsible for decreasin g the error to εTV. In comparison to the Annealed Langevin sampler (Algorithm 1, Theorem 2.2), which c an be viewed as using the corrector step alone, adding a predictor step provides a better warm start for the distribution at the next smaller noise level, resulting in better dependence on parameters. Thus the pre dictor-corrector algorithm combines the strengths of the predictor and corrector steps. For real-world data, it can be challenging to estimate TV- distance between distributions given only samples, and hence diﬃcult to check consistency with empirical observations. However, our claim that using a corrector can impro ve the convergence rate of DDPM/SMLD is consistent with the simulation results in Section 4.2 of [Son+20b]. 4 Theoretical framework and proof sketches The main idea of our analysis framework is to convert a L2 error guarantee to a L∞ error guarantee by excluding a bad set, formalized in the following theorem. Theorem 4.1. Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space and {Fn}be a ﬁltration of the sigma ﬁeld F. Suppose Xn ∼pn, Zn ∼qn, and Zn ∼qn are Fn-adapted random processes taking values in Ω, and Bn ⊆Ω are sets such that the following hold for every n∈N0. 1. If Zk ∈Bc k for all 0 ≤k≤n−1, then Zn = Zn. (For n= 0, this says Z0 = Z0.) 2. χ2(qn||pn) ≤D2 n. 3. P(Xn ∈Bn) ≤δn. Then the following hold. TV(qn, qn) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k TV(pn,q n) ≤Dn + n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k (6) 7For our setting, we will take the “bad sets” Bn to be the set of x where ∥sθ(x) −∇ln p∥is large, qn to be the discretized process with estimated score, and qn to be the discretized process with estimated score except in Bn where the error is large. Because qn uses an L∞-accurate score estimate, we can use existing techniques for analyzing Langevin Monte Carlo [VW19; EHZ21; Che+ 21] to bound χ2(qn||pn). Proof. First note that if some Zk ∈Bk for 0 ≤k≤n−1, then for the smallest suchk, we haveZk = Zk ∈Bk; the same is true if Zk ∈Bk for some 0 ≤k≤n−1. We then bound using condition 1 and Cauchy-Schwarz: P ( Zn ̸= Zn ) ≤P (n−1⋃ k=0 {Zk ∈Bk} ) = P (n−1⋃ k=0 {Zk ∈Bk} ) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 P ( Zk ∈Bk ) = n−1∑ k=0 Eqk /BD Bk ≤ n−1∑ k=0 ( Epk (qk pk ) 2) 1/2 (Epk /BD Bk )1/2 = n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k . The second inequality then follows from the triangle inequality and Cau chy-Schwarz: TV(pn,q n) ≤TV(pn, qn) + TV(qn,q n) ≤ √ χ2(qn||pn) + TV(qn,q n) ≤Dn + n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k . It now remains to give χ2 convergence bounds under L∞-accurate score estimate. The following theorem may be of independent interest. Theorem 4.2 (LMC under L∞ bound on gradient error). Let p: Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1(1, 2) and s: Rd →Rd be a score estimate swith error bounded in L∞: for some ε1 ≤ √ 1 48CLS , ∥∇ln p−s∥∞ = max x∈Rd ∥∇ln p(x) −s(x)∥] ≤ε1. Let N ∈N0 and 0 < h≤ 1 4392dCLSL2 , and assume L ≥1. Let qnh denote the nth iterate of LMC with step size h score estimate s. Then χ2(q(k+1)h||p) ≤exp ( − h 4CLS ) χ2(qkh||p) + 170dL2h2 + 5ε2 1h and χ2(qNh||p) ≤exp ( −Nh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 680dL2hCLS + 20ε2 1CLS ≤exp ( −Nh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 1 Following [Che+21], we prove this by ﬁrst deﬁning a continuous-time interpolation qt of the discrete pro- cess, and then deriving a diﬀerential inequality forχ2(qt||p) using the log-Sobolev inequality for p. Compared to [Che+21], we incur an extra error term arising from the inaccurat e gradient. This allows us to sketch the proof of Theorem 2.1; a complete proof is in Section B. Proof sketch of Theorem 2.1. We ﬁrst deﬁne the bad set where the error in the score estimate is la rge, B : = {∥∇ln p(x) −s(x)∥>ε1} for some ε1 to be chosen. Then by Chebyshev’s inequality, P(B) ≤ ( ε ε1 ) 2 =: δ. Let qnh be the discretized process, but where the score estimate is set to be equal to ∇ln p on B; note it agrees with qnh as long as 8it has not hit B. Because qnh uses a score estimate that has L∞-error ε1, Theorem 4.2 gives a bound for χ2(qNh||p). Then Theorem 4.1 gives TV(qnh, qnh) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 (χ2( qkh||p) + 1)1/2P(B)1/2 ≤ n−1∑ k=0 ( exp ( − kh 8CLS ) χ2(q0||p)1/2 + 1 ) δ1/2 The theorem then follows from choosing parameters so that χ2(qT||p) ≤ε2 χ and TV(qT, qT) ≤εTV. We remark that the main ineﬃciency in the proof comes from the use o f Chebyshev’s inequality, and a Lp bound on the error for p> 2 will improve the bound. Proof sketch of Theorem 2.2. Choosing the sequence σ1 <··· <σ M to be geometric with ratio 1+ 1√ d ensures that the χ2-divergence between successive distributions pσ2m is O(1). Then, choosing σ2 M = Ω(CLSd) ensures we have a warm start for the highest noise level: χ2(pprior||pσ2 M ) = O(1). This uses O (√ dlog ( dCLS σ2 min )) noise levels. Chebyshev’s inequality can be used to show that the distribut ion of the ﬁnal sample x(m) for pσ2m is O(εTV/M ) close to a distribution that is O(M/ε TV) in χ2-divergence from pσ2 m+1 . This gives the warm start parameter Kχ = (M/ε TV)1/2; substituting into Theorem 2.1 then gives the required bound for ε. Note that the TV errors accrued from each level add to O(εTV). To analyze the predictor-based algorithms, we also ﬁrst prove con vergence bounds under L∞-accurate score estimate. Theorem 4.3 (Predictor steps under L∞ bound on score estimate, DDPM). Let p: Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 and s(·,t ) : Rd →Rd be a score estimate s with error bounded in L∞ for each t∈[0,T ]: ∥∇ln p−s(·,t )∥∞ = max x∈Rd ∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥] ≤ε1. Consider DDPM with g ≡1, T ≥1 ∨ln(CLSd), and h = O ( 1 CLS(d+CLS)(L∨Ls)2 ) . (Recall that pkh and qkh are the k-th iterate of LMC with step size h and true/estimated score respectively.) Then χ2(q(k+1)h||p(k+1)h) ≤χ2(qkh||pkh)e ( − 1 8CLS +8ε2 1 ) h + O(ε2 1h+ (L2 s + L2d)h2) and if ε1 < 1 128CLS , χ2(qNh||pNh) ≤e− N h 16CLS χ2(q0||p0) + O ( CLS ( ε2 1 + (L2 s + L2d)h )) . Moreover, for q0 = pprior, χ2(q0||p0) ≤e−T/2CLSd. We give a more precise statement in Section C. Note that unlike the ca se for LMC as in Theorem 4.2, the base density pt is also evolving in time, which produces additional error terms and nec essitates a more involved analysis. The additional error terms can be bounded using t he Donsker-Varadhan variational principle, concentration for distributions satisfying LSI, and erro r bounds between pt and pt+h for small h. Here, we only state the result about DDPM, which has better bound s than SMLD (when g ≡1) be- cause both the forward and backwards processes exhibit better mixing properties: the warm start improves exponentially rather than inversely with T, and the log-Sobolev constant is uniformly bounded by that of pdata rather than increasing. However, the analysis in Section C can be dir ectly applied to SMLD and other models as well. We also note there is a sense in which DDPM and SMLD are e quivalent under a rescaling in time and space (see discussion in Section C.2). Note that the choice of his necessary for exponential decay of error; as if his not small enough, we would get an exponential growing instead of decaying factor in the one-s tep error (See Section C for details). Such an h may however still be a suitable choice when used in conjunction with a c orrector step. Moreover, as ε1 →0, with appropriate choice of T and h, qNh and pNh can be made arbitrarily close. 9Theorem 3.1 now follows from the L∞ result (Theorem 4.3) in the same way that Theorem 2.1 follows from Theorem 4.2. To prove Theorem 3.2, it suﬃces to run the corrector steps only at the lowest noise level, that is, set Nm = 0 for 1 ≤ m < T/h , although we note that interleaving the predictor and corrector s teps does empirically help with mixing. The proof follows from using the predictor a nd the corrector theorems in series: ﬁrst apply Theorem 3.1 with εχ = O(1) to show that the predictor results a warm start pdata, then use Theorem 2.1 to show the corrector reduces the error to the d esired εTV. 5 Conclusion We introduced a general framework to analyze SDE-based sampling algorithms given a L2-error score es- timate, and used it to obtain the ﬁrst convergence bounds for sev eral score-based generative models with polynomial complexity in all parameters. Our analysis can potentially b e adapted to other SDE’s and sam- pling algorithms beyond Langevin Monte Carlo. There is also room for im proving our analysis to better use smoothing properties of the SDE’s and compare diﬀerent choices of the diﬀusion speed g. We present several interesting further directions to explore. In addition to extending the analysis to other SGM’s and comparing their theoretical performance (relative to ea ch other as well as other approaches to generative modeling), we propose the following. Analysis for multimodal distributions. Our assumption of a bounded log-Sobolev constant essentially limits the analysis to distributions that are close to unimodal. However , SGM’s are empirically successful at modeling multimodal distributions [SE19], and in fact perform bette r with multimodal distributions than other approaches such as GAN’s. Can we analyze the convergence for simple multimodal distributions, such as a mixture of distributions each with bounded log-Sobolev constan t? Positive results on sampling from multimodal distributions such as [GLR18] suggest this is possible, as t he sequence of noised distributions is natural for annealing and tempering methods (see [GLR18, Remark 7.2]). Weakening conditions on the score estimate. The assumption that we have a score estimate that is O(1)-accurate in L2, although weaker than the usual assumptions for theoretical an alysis, is in fact still a strong condition in practice that seems unlikely to be satisﬁed (and diﬃcult to check) when learning complex distributions such as distributions of images. What would a reasonab le weaker condition be, and in what sense can we still obtain reasonable samples? Guarantees for learning the score function. Our analysis assumes a L2-estimate of the score function is given, but the question remains of when we can ﬁnd such an estimat e. What natural conditions on distributions allow their score functions to be learned by a neural ne twork? Various works have considered the representability of data distributions by diﬀusion-like processes [TR19], but the questions of optimization and generalization appear more challenging.

In the fo llowing, we will consider the SDE dxt = f(x,t ) dt+ G(t) dwt (7) and the interpolation of the discretization of an approximation dzt = ˆf(zt− ,t ) dt+ G(t) dwt (8) when t ≥t−. Let Pt and Qt denote the law of xt and zt, respectively. We will take t− = kh and t ∈ [kh, (k+ 1)h). We will assume that f, ˆf,G are continuous and the functions f(·,t ), ˆf(·,t ) are uniformly Lipschitz for each t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h]. In this section, we will make some computations that will be used in bot h Sections B and C. First, we derive how the density evolves in time. Lemma A.1. Let Qt denote the law of the interpolated process (8). Then ∂qt(z) ∂t = ∇· [ −qt(z)E [ ˆf(zt− ,t )|zt = z ] + G(t)G(t)⊤ 2 ∇qt(z) ] . Proof. Let qt|t− denote the distribution of zt conditioned on zt− . Then the Fokker-Planck equation gives ∂qt|t− (z|zt− ) ∂t = −∇qt|t− (z|zt− ) ·[ ˆf(zt− ,t )] + G(t)G(t)⊤ 2 ∆qt|t− (z|zt− ) Taking expectation with respect to zt− we get ∂qt(z) ∂t = ∇· ∫ −qt|t− (z) ˆf(y,t )qt− (y)dy+ ∇· [G(t)G(t)⊤ 2 ∇ ∫ qt|t− (z|y)qt− (y)dy ] = ∇·qt(z) ∫ [ −ˆf(y,t )qk|t(y|z)dy+ G(t)G(t)⊤ 2 ∇ ∫ qt−|t(y|z)qt(z)dy ] . Note that for ﬁxed z, ∫ qt−|t(y|z)dy= 1. Hence ∂qt(z) ∂t = ∇· [ −qt(z)E [ ˆf(zt− ,t )|zt = z ] + G(t)G(t)⊤ 2 ∇qt(z) ] . We now use Lemma A.1 to compute how the χ2-divergence between the approximate and exact densities changes. The following generalizes the calculation of [EHZ21] in the c ase where xt is a non-stationary stochastic process. For simplicity of notation, from now on, we wil c onsider the case G(t) being a scalar. Lemma A.2. Let Pt and Qt be the laws of (7) and (8) for G(t) = g(t)Id. Then ∂ ∂tχ2(qt||pt) = −g(t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⟨ ˆf(zt− ,t ) −f(zt,t ), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] . Proof. The Fokker-Planck equation gives ∂pt(x) ∂t = ∇· [ −f(x,t )pt(x) + g(t)2 2 ∇pt(x) ] . We have d dtχ2(qt||pt) = d dt ∫ qt(x)2 pt(x) dx= ∫ [ 2∂qt(x) ∂t qt(x) pt(x) −∂pt(x) ∂t qt(x)2 pt(x)2 ] dx. 14For the ﬁrst term, by Lemma A.1, 2 ∫ ∂qt(x) ∂t qt(x) pt(x)dx= 2 ∫ ∇· [ −qt(x)E [ ˆf(z0,t )|zt = x ] + g(t)2 2 ∇qt(x) ] ·qt(x) pt(x)dx = 2 ∫ qt(x) ⟨ E [ ˆf(z0,t )|zt = x ] , ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ dx−g(t)2 ∫ ⟨ ∇qt(x), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ dx. (9) For the second term, using integration by parts, − ∫ ∂pt(x) ∂t qt(x)2 pt(x)2 dx= ∫ ∇· [ f(x,t )pt(x) −g(t)2 2 ∇pt(x) ] ·qt(x)2 pt(x)2 dx = ∫ −f(x,t )pt(x)∇qt(x)2 pt(x)2 + g(t)2 2 ⟨ ∇pt(x), ∇qt(x)2 pt(x)2 ⟩ dx = −2 ∫ qt(x) ⟨ f(x,t ), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ dx + g(t)2 ∫ qt(x) pt(x) ⟨ ∇pt(x), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ dx. (10) Note that ∫ ⟨ ∇qt(x), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ −qt(x) pt(x) ⟨ ∇pt(x), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ = ∫ ⟨ ∇qt(x) pt(x), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ qt(x) dx= Ept (qt pt ) . Combining (9) and (10), d dtχ2(qt||pt) = −g(t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2 ∫ qt(x) ⟨ E [ ˆf(zt− ,t ) −f(x,t )|zt = x ] , ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩ dx = −g(t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⟨ ˆf(zt− ,t ) −f(zt,t ), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] . Finally, we will make good use of the following lemma to bound the second term in Lemma A.2. Lemma A.3 (cf. [EHZ21, Lemma 1]) . Let φt(x) = qt(x) pt(x) and ψt(x) = φt(x)/ Ept φ2 t. For any c and any Rd-valued random variable u, we have E [⟨ u, ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤E [ ∥u∥    ∇qt(zt) pt(zt)     ] ≤C·Ept φ2 t ·E [ ∥u∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt (qt pt ) . Proof. Note that Eψt(zt) = 1 and the normalizing factor is Ept φ2 t = χ2(qt||pt) + 1. By Young’s inequality, E [⟨ u, ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] = E [⟨ u √ qt(zt) pt(zt), √ pt(zt) qt(zt) ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤CE [ ∥u∥2 qt(zt) pt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt [   ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2] = CE [ ∥u∥2 qt(zt) pt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt (qt pt ) . 15B Analysis for LMC Let p be the probability density we wish to sample from. Suppose that we ha ve an estimate s of the score ∇ln p. Our main theorem says that if the L2 error Ep∥∇ln p−s∥2 is small enough, then running LMC with s for an appropriate time results in a density that is close in TV distance to a density that is close in χ2-divergence to p. The following is a more precise version of Theorem 2.1. Theorem B.1 (LMC with L2-accurate score estimate) . Let p : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 with L ≥1 and s : Rd →Rd be a score estimate satisfying Assumption 2(2). Consider th e accuracy requirement in TV and χ2: 0 < εTV < 1, 0 < εχ < 1, and suppose furthermore the starting distribution satisﬁes χ2(p0||p) ≤K2 χ. Then if ε≤ εTVε3 χ 174080 √ 5dL2C5/2 LS (CT ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∨2Kχ) , then running (LMC-SE) with score estimate sand step size h= ε2 χ 2720dL2CLS for any time T ∈[Tmin,C TTmin], where Tmin = 4 CLS ln ( 2Kχ ε2 χ ) , results in a distribution pT such that pT is εTV-far in TV distance from a distribution pT, where pT satisﬁes χ2(pT||p) ≤ε2 χ. In particular, taking εχ = εTV, we have the error guarantee that TV(pT,p ) = 2εTV. The main diﬃculty is that the stationary distribution of LMC using the score estimate may be arbitrarily far from p, even if the L2 error of the score estimate is bounded. (See Section D.) Thus, a lon g-time convergence result does not hold, and an upper bound on T is required, as in the theorem statement. We instead proceed by showing that conditioned on not hitting a bad set , if we run LMC using s, the χ2-divergence to the stationary distribution will decrease. This mean s that the closeness of the overall distribution (in TV distance, say) will decrease in the short term, de spite it will increase in the long term, as the probability of hitting the bad set increases. This does not con tradict the fact that the stationary distribution is diﬀerent from p. By running for a moderate amount of time (just enough for mixing) , we can ensure that the probability of hitting the bad set is small, so that the resulting distribution is close to p. Note that we state the theorem with a CT parameter to allow a range of times that we can run LMC for. More precisely, we prove Theorem B.1 in two steps. LMC under L∞ gradient error (Section B.1, Theorem 4.2). First, consider a simpler problem: proving a bound for χ2 divergence for LMC with score estimate s, when ∥s−∇ln p∥is bounded everywhere, not just on average. For this, we follow the argument in [Che+21] fo r showing convergence of LMC in R´ enyi divergence; this also gives a bound in χ2-divergence. We deﬁne an interpolation of the discrete process an d derive a upper bound for the derivative of R´ enyi divergence,∂tRq(qt||p), using the log-Sobolev inequality for p. In the original proof, the error comes from the discretization er ror; here we have an additional error term coming from an inaccurate gradient, which is bounded by assumption . Note that a L2 bound on ∇f −s is insuﬃcient to give an upper bound, as we need to bound Eqtψt [∥∇f−s∥2] for a diﬀerent measure qtψt that we do not have good control over. An L∞ bound works regardless of the measure. Deﬁning a bad set and bounding the hitting time (Section B.2) . The idea is now to reduce to the case of L∞ error by deﬁning the “bad set” B to be the set where ∥s−∇f∥≥ ε1, where ε≪ε1 ≪1. This set has small measure by Chebyshev’s inequality. Away from the bad set, Theorem 4.2 applies; it then suﬃces to bound the probability of hitting B. Technically, we deﬁne a coupling with a hypothetical process where the L∞ error is always bounded, and note that the processes disagree ex actly when it hits B; this is the source of the TV error. We consider the probability of being in B at times 0 ,h, 2h,... . we note that Theorem B.1 bounds the χ2-divergence of this hypothetical process Xt at time t to p. If the distribution were actually p, then the probability Xt ∈B′ is exactly p(B′); we expect the probability to be small even if the distribution is close 16to p. Indeed, by Cauchy-Schwarz, we can bound the probability X ∈B in terms of P(B) and χ2(qt||p); this bound is given in Theorem 4.1. Note that the eventual bound depend s on χ2(qt||p), so we have to assume a warm start, that is, a reasonable bound on χ2(q0||p). B.1 LMC under L∞ gradient error The following gives a long-time convergence bound for LMC with inaccu rate gradient, with error bounded in L∞; this may be of independent interest. Theorem 4.2 (LMC under L∞ bound on gradient error). Let p: Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1(1, 2) and s: Rd →Rd be a score estimate swith error bounded in L∞: for some ε1 ≤ √ 1 48CLS , ∥∇ln p−s∥∞ = max x∈Rd ∥∇ln p(x) −s(x)∥] ≤ε1. Let N ∈N0 and 0 < h≤ 1 4392dCLSL2 , and assume L ≥1. Let qnh denote the nth iterate of LMC with step size h score estimate s. Then χ2(q(k+1)h||p) ≤exp ( − h 4CLS ) χ2(qkh||p) + 170dL2h2 + 5ε2 1h and χ2(qNh||p) ≤exp ( −Nh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 680dL2hCLS + 20ε2 1CLS ≤exp ( −Nh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 1 Following [Che+21], convergence in R´ enyi divergence can also be derived; we only consider χ2-divergence because we will need a warm start in χ2-divergence for our application. Note that by letting N →∞ and h→0, we obtain the following. Corollary B.2. Keep the assumptions in Theorem 4.2. The stationary distrib ution q of Langevin diﬀusion with score estimate s satisﬁes χ2(q||p) ≤20CLSε2 1. Proof of Theorem 4.2. We follow the proof of [Che+21, Theorem 4], except that we work with the χ2 diver- gence directly, rather than the R´ enyi divergence, and have an extra term from the inaccurate gradient (17). Given t≥0, let t− = h ⌊t h ⌋ . Deﬁne the interpolated process by dzt = s(zt− ) dt+ √ 2 dwt, (11) and let qt denote the distribution of Xt at time t, when X0 ∼q0. By Lemma A.2, ∂ ∂tχ2(qt||p) = −2Ep (qt p ) + 2E [⟨ s(zt− ) −∇ln p(zt), ∇qt(zt) p(zt) ⟩] . (12) By the proof of Theorem 4 in [Che+21],  ∇ln p(xt) −∇ln p(xt− )  2 ≤9L2(t−t−)2 ∥∇ln p(xt)∥2 + 6L2  Bt −Bt−  2 .

(13) 17Let φt := qt/p and ψt := φt Ep(φ2 t ) . By Lemma A.3, 2E [⟨ s(zt− ) −∇ln p(zt), ∇qt(zt)p(zt) ⟩] ≤2Epφ2 t ·E [ s(zt− ) −∇ln p(zt)  2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 2Ep (qt p ) ≤A1 + A2 + A3 + 1 2Ep(φt) (14) where A1,A 2,A 3 are obtained by substituting in the 3 terms in (13), and given in (15), (16), and (17). Let V(x) = −ln p(x). We consider each term in turn. A1 : = 36L2(t−t−)2Epφ2 t ·E [ ∥∇V(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] (15) ≤36L2(t−t−)2Epφ2 t · (4Ep(φt) Epφ2 t + 2dL ) by [Che+21, Lemma 16] ≤1 2Ep(φt) + 72dL3(t−t−)2(χ2(qt||p) + 1) when h2 ≤ 1 288L2 . By [Che+21, p. 15] A2 : = 24L2Epφ2 t ·E [ Bt −Bt−  2 ψt(zt) ] (16) ≤24L2Epφ2 t · ( 14dL2(t−t−) + 32hCLS Ep(φt) Epφ2 t ) ≤336dL2(t−t−)(χ2(qt||p) + 1) + 1 2Ep(φt) when h≤ 1 1536L2CLS . Finally, A3 : = 4ε2 1Epφ2 t = 4ε2 1(χ2(qt||p) + 1). (17) Combining (12), (14), (15), (16), and (17) gives ∂ ∂tχ2(qt||p) ≤−1 2Ep(φt) + (χ2(qt||p) + 1)(72dL3(t−t−)2 + 336dL2(t−t−) + 4ε2 1) ≤− 1 2CLS χ2(qt||p) + (χ2(qt||p) + 1)(72dL3(t−t−)2 + 336L2d(t−t−) + 4ε2 1) ≤− 1 4CLS χ2(qt||p) + (72dL3(t−t−)2 + 336dL2(t−t−) + 4ε2 1) if h≤ ( 1 12·72dL3CLS ) 1/2 ∧ 1 12·336dCLS and ε1 ≤ ( 1 48CLS ) 1/2 . Then for t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h), ∂ ∂t ( χ2(qt||p) exp (t−t− 4CLS )) = exp (t−t− 4CLS ) (72dL3(t−t−)2 + 336dL2(t−t−) + 4ε2 1) ≤73dL3(t−t−)2 + 337dL2(t−t−) + 5ε2 1. Integrating over t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h) gives χ2(q(k+1)h||p) ≤exp ( − h 4CLS ) χ2(qkh||p) + 73 3 dL3h3 + 337 2 dL2h2 + 5ε2 1h ≤exp ( − h 4CLS ) χ2(qkh||p) + 170dL2h2 + 5ε2 1h 18using h≤ 1 12 √ 2L. Unfolding the recurrence and summing the geometric series gives χ2(qkh||p) ≤exp ( − kh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 680dL2hCLS + 20ε2 1CLS ≤exp ( − kh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 1 when h≤ 1 1360dL2CLS and ε2 1 ≤ 1 40CLS . We can check that the given condition onhand the fact that LCLS ≥1 (Lemma E.5) imply all the required inequalities on h. B.2 Proof of Theorem B.1 Proof of Theorem B.1. We ﬁrst deﬁne the bad set where the error in the score estimate is la rge, B : = {∥∇ln p(x) −s(x)∥>ε1} for some ε1 to be chosen. Given t≥0, let t− = h ⌊t h ⌋ . Given a bad set B, deﬁne the interpolated process by dzt = b(zt− ) dt+ √ 2 dwt, (18) where b(z) = { s(z), z ̸∈B ∇ln p(z), z ∈B . In other words, run LMC using the score estimate as long as the poin t is in the good set at the previous discretization step, and otherwise use the actual gradient ∇ln p. Let qt denote the distribution of zt when z0 ∼q0; note that qnh is the distribution resulting from running LMC with estimate b for n steps and step size h. Note that this auxiliary process is deﬁned only for purposes of ana lysis; it cannot be used for practical algorithm as we do not have access to ∇f. We can couple this process with LMC using s so that as long as Xt does not hit B, the processes agree, thus satisfying condition 1 of Theorem 4.1. Then by Chebyshev’s inequality, P(B) ≤ (ε ε1 ) 2 =: δ. Let T = Nh. Then by Theorem 4.2, χ2(˜qkh||p) ≤exp ( − kh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 680dL2hCLS + 20ε2 1CLS ≤exp ( − kh 4CLS ) χ2(q0||p) + 1. For this to be bounded by ε2 χ, it suﬃces for the terms to be bounded by ε2 χ 2 , ε2 χ 4 , ε2 χ 4 ; this is implied by T ≥4CLS ln (2Kχ ε2 χ ) =: Tmin h= ε2 χ 4392dL2CLS ε1 = εχ 4√5CLS . 19(We choose h so that the condition in Theorem 4.2 is satisﬁed; note εχ ≤1.) By Theorem 4.1, TV(qNh, qNh) ≤ N−1∑ k=0 (1 + χ2(qkh||p))1/2P(B)1/2 ≤ (N−1∑ k=0 exp ( − kh 8CLS ) χ2(q0||p)1/2 + 2 ) δ1/2 ≤ ((∞∑ k=0 exp ( − kh 8CLS ) Kχ ) + 2N ) ε ε1 ≤ ε ε1 (16CLS h Kχ+ 2N ) . In order for this to be ≤εTV, it suﬃces for ε≤ε1εTV ( 1 4N ∧ h 32CLSKχ ) . Supposing that we run for time T where Tmin ≤T ≤CTTmin, we have that N = T h ≤ CT Tmin h . Thus it suﬃces for ε≤ε1εTV ( h 4CTTmin ∧ h 32CLSKχ ) = εχ 4√5CLS ·εTV · ε2 χ 2720dL2CLS ( 1 16CTCLS ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∧ 1 32CLSKχ ) = εTVε3 χ 174080 √ 5dL2C5/2 LS (CT ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∨2Kχ) .B.3 Proof of Theorem 2.2 We restate the theorem for convenience. Theorem 2.2 (Annealed LMC with L2-accurate score estimate) . Let p : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 for M1 = O(d), and let pσ2 := p∗ϕσ2 . Suppose furthermore that ∇ln pσ2 is L- Lipschitz for every σ ≥0. Given σmin > 0, there exists a sequence σmin = σ1 < ··· < σM with M = O (√ dlog ( dCLS σ2 min )) such that for each m, if  ∇ln(pσ2m ) −s(·,σ 2 m)  2 L2(pσ 2m ) = Epσ 2m [  ∇ln pσ2m (x) −s(x,σ 2 m)  2 ] ≤ε2. with ε:= ˜O ( ε4.5 TV d3.25L2C2.5 LS ) (3) then x(1) is a sample from a distribution q such that TV(q,p σ2 1 ) ≤εTV. Proof. We choose hM = ··· = h2 = Θ ( 1 dL2CLS ) h1 = Θ (dL2CLS ε2 TV ) TM−1 = ··· = T2 = Θ ( CLS ln (M εTV )) T1 = Θ ( CLS ln ( 1 εTV )) , and TM = 0, Nm = Tm/h . 20Choose the sequence σ2 min = σ2 1 <··· <σ 2 M to be geometric with ratio 1 + Θ ( 1√ d ) . Note that χ2(N(0,σ 2 2 Id)||N(0,σ 2 1 Id)) = σd 1 σ2d 2 (2σ−2 2 −σ−2 1 )−d/2 −1 = (σ2 2 σ2 1 ) −d/2 ( 2 − (σ2 σ1 ) 2) − d 2 . For σ2 2 = (1 + ε)σ2 1 , this equals (1 + ε)−d/2(1 −ε)−d/2 = (1 −ε2)−d/2 −1. For ε = Θ ( 1√ d ) , this is d·O (1 d ) = O(1). Hence, the χ2-divergence between successive distributions pσ2m is O(1). Choosing σ2 M = Ω(d(M1 + CLS)) ensures we have a warm start for the highest noise level by Lemm a E.9: χ2(pprior||pσ2 M ) = O(1). This uses O (√ dlog ( dCLS σ2 min )) noise levels. Write pm = pσ2 m for short. Let qm be the distribution of the ﬁnal sample x(m). We show by downwards induction on m that there is qm such that TV(qm, qm) ≤(M + 1) −m M + 1 εTV χ2(qm||pm) ≤ ( εTV 4(M + 1) ) 2 . For m = M, this follows from the assumption on ε and Theorem 2.1 with Kχ = O(1) (given by the warm start). Fix m<M and suppose it holds for m+ 1. We use the closeness between qm+1 and pm+1 combined with χ2(pm+1||pm) = O(1) to obtain compute how close qm+1 and pm are. Because the triangle inequality does not hold for χ2, we will incur an extra TV error. Let qm,m+1 be the distribution of the ﬁnal sample if x(m+1) 0 ∼ qm. We have TV( qm+1, qm,m+1) ≤ TV(qm, qm) ≤(M+1)−m M+1 εTV. By Markov’s inequality, when χ2(pm+1||pm) ≤1, Ppm+1 (pm+1 pm ≥8(M + 1) εTV ) ≤χ2(pm+1||pm) + 1 8(M + 1)/ε TV ≤ εTV 4(M + 1). Let qm+1,m = /BD { pm+1 pm ≤ 8(M+1) ε TV } qm+1 / ∫{ pm+1 pm ≤ 8(M+1) ε TV } qm+1. Note that (using TV(qm+1,p m+1) ≤ √ χ2(qm+1||pm+1) ≤ εTV 4(M+1) ) Pqm+1 (pm+1 pm ≥8(M + 1) εTV ) ≤Ppm+1 (pm+1 pm ≥8(M + 1) εTV ) + TV(qm+1,p m+1) ≤ εTV 4(M + 1) + εTV 4(M + 1) ≤1 2. (19) so qm+1,m ≤2qm+1 and χ2(qm+1,m||pm) + 1 ≤2(χ2(qm+1||pm) + 1) = ∫ { pm+1 pm ≤ 8(M+1) ε TV } qm+1(x)2 pm+1(x)2 ·pm+1(x) pm(x) pm+1(x) dx ≤8(M + 1) εTV (χ2(qm+1||pm+1) + 1) ≤16(M+ 1) εTV . Let q′ m+1,m be the distribution of x(m) Nm when x(m) 0 ∼ qm+1,m. Then by assumption on ε(3) and Theorem 2.1 (with Kχ = 4 √ M+1 εTV , εχ = εTV 4(M+1) , and εTV ← εTV 2(M+1) ), there is qm such that TV( q′ m,m+1, qm) ≤ εTV 2(M+1) 21and χ2(qm||pm) ≤ εTV 4(M+1) . It remains to bound TV(qm, qm) ≤TV(qm, q′ m,m+1) + TV( q′ m,m+1, qm) ≤TV(qm+1, qm,m+1) + εTV 2(M + 1) ≤TV(qm+1, qm+1) + TV(qm+1, qm+1,m) + εTV 2(M + 1) ≤(M + 1) −(m+ 1) M + 1 εTV + Pqm+1 (pm+1 pm ≥8(M+ 1) εTV ) + εTV 2(M + 1) ≤(M + 1) −(m+ 1) M + 1 εTV + εTV 2(M + 1) + εTV 2(M + 1) = (M + 1) −m M + 1 εTV, where we use (19) in the last line. This ﬁnishes the induction step. Finally, the theorem follows by taking m= 1 and noting TV(q1,p 1) ≤TV(q1, q1) + TV(q1,p 1) ≤TV(q1, q1) + √ χ2(q1||p1) ≤MεTV M + 1 + εTV 4(M + 1) ≤εTV. C Analysis for SGM based on reverse SDE’s In this section, we analyze score-based generative models based o n reverse SDE’s. In Section C.2, we prove convergence of the predictor algorithm under L∞-accurate score estimate (Theorem 4.3, restated as C.1) using lemmas proved in Section C.3, C.4, C.5, and C.6. In Section C.7, we p rove convergence of the predictor algorithm under L2-accurate score estimate (Theorem 3.1, restated as C.16). In Se ction C.8, we prove convergence of the predictor-corrector algorithm (Theo rem 3.2). C.1 Discretization and Score Estimation With a change of variable in (4), we deﬁne the sampling process xt on [0,T ] by dxt = [−f(xt,T −t) + g(T −t)2∇ln ˜pT−t(xt)] dt+ g(T −t) dwt, x 0 ∼˜pT. Denoting the distribution of xt by pt and running the process from 0 to T, we will exactly obtain pT = ˜p0, which is the data distribution. In practice, we need to discretize this process and replace the score function ∇ln ˜pT−t with the estimated score s. With a general Euler-Maruyama method, we would obtain {zk}N k=0 deﬁned by z(k+1)h = zkh −h·[f(zkh,T −kh) −g(T −kh)2s(zkh,T −kh)] + √ h·g(T −kh)ηk+1, (20) where h = T/N is the step size and ηk is a sequence of independent Gaussian random vectors. As we run (20) from 0 to N with h small enough, we should expect that the distribution of zT is close to that of xT. However, in both SMLD or DDPM models, for ﬁxed zk, the integration ∫ (k+1)h kh f(zkh,T −t) dt and s(zkh,T −kh) · ∫ (k+1)h kh g(T −t)2 dt can be exactly computed, as can the diﬀusion term. Therefore, we can consider the following process zt as an “interpolation” of (20): dzt = [−f(zkh,T −t) + g(T −t)2s(zkh,T −kh)] dt+ g(T −t) dwt, t ∈[kh, (k+ 1)h]. (21) 22Note that by running this process instead, we can reduce the discr etization error. Now if we denote the distribution of zt by qt, with q0 ≈p0, we can expect that qT is close to pT. Here the estimated score s satisﬁes for all x ∥s(x,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−kh(x)∥≤ εkh, k = 0, 1,...,N. (22) Observe that in either SMLD or DDPM, the function g(t)2 is Lipschitz on [0,T ]. So in the following sections, we will assume that g(t)2 is Lg-Lipschitz on [0,T ]. C.2 Predictor In this section, we present the main result (Theorem C.1) on the one -step error of the predictor in χ2- divergence, which can be obtained by directly applying the Gronwall’s inequality to the diﬀerential inequality derived in Lemma C.3. Note that Theorem C.1 is a more precise version o f Theorem 4.3; see the remark following the theorem. Theorem C.1. With the setting in Section C.1, assume g is non-decreasing and let 0 <h ≤ min kh≤t≤(k+1)h 1 g(T −kh)2(28L2 + 10Ct + Ept ∥x∥2 + 64Ct,L+ 128Cd,L+ 360L2 s( ˜Rt + 2CtRd)) where Ct is the log-Sobolev constant of pt, bounded in Lemma E.7. Suppose that ∇ln pt is L-Lipschitz for all t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h], s(·,kh ) is Ls-Lipschitz, L,L s ≥1, and εkh is such that (22) holds. Then χ2(q(k+1)h||p(k+1)h) ≤ [ χ2(qkh||pkh) + ∫ (k+1)h kh Ct,khdt ] e ∫ (k+1)h kh (− 1 8Ct +8ε2 kh )g(T−t)2 dt Here, Ct,kh = [ 8ε2 kh + E·(t−kh)g(T −kh)2] g(T −t)2 and E = 9(4L2 s + 1) + 8Cd,L Ct,L = { 32L2 in SMLD , (88C2 t + 400)L2 in DDPM , Cd,L = { 76L2d in SMLD , 6 + 94L2d in DDPM ≤100L2d ˜Rt = 9(Ct + 1) Rd = 300d+ 12 are deﬁned in (24), (27), (28), (30) and (31), respectively. Proof. The theorem follows from applying Gronwall’s inequality to the result of Lemma C.3. Remark. Note that in DDPM, E = O(L2 s+ L2d). Therefore, when g≡1, Ct,kh = O(ε2 1 + (L2 s+ L2d)h), where we denote the upper bound of εkh for all k ∈{0,...,N }by ε1. Using the bound on the log-Sobolev constant (Lemma E.7) and second moment (Lemma E.8) for DDPM, we note that the restriction on h for all steps is implied by h= O ( 1 Epdata ∥x∥2 + CLS(CLS + d)(L∨Ls)2 ) with appropriate constants. Then we can conclude the ﬁrst inequa lity in Theorem 4.3 by combining Theo- rem C.1 and Lemma E.7 and the second inequality from unfolding the ﬁrst one and evaluating the geometric series. Likewise, we have the following analogue for SMLD, for which w e omit the proof. 23Theorem C.2 (Predictor steps under L∞ bound on score estimate, SMLD). Let p: Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 and s(·,t ) : Rd →Rd be a score estimate s with error bounded in L∞ for each t∈[0,T ]: ∥∇ln p−s(·,t )∥∞ = max x∈Rd ∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥] ≤ε1. Consider SMLD. Let CT = CLS + T. Let g≡1, T ≥CLSd, and h= O ( 1 Ep0 ∥x∥2+CT d(L∨Ls)2 ) . Then χ2(q(k+1)h||p(k+1)h) ≤χ2(qkh||pkh)e (− 1 8CT −kh +8ε2 1)h + O(ε2 1h+ (L2 s + L2d)h2) and letting t= T −Nh, if ε1 < 1 128CT , χ2(qNh||pNh) ≤ (CLS + t CLS + T ) 1 16 χ2(q0||p0) + O ( ln (CLS + T CLS + t ) ( ε2 1 + (L2 s + L2d)h ) ) . Moreover, for q0 = pprior, q0 = ϕT, χ2(q0||p0) ≤CLSd T . Remark. We note that in a sense SMLD and DDPM are equivalent, as we can get f rom one to the other by rescaling in time and space. First we recall that, as discussed in Se ction 3, all the SMLD models are equivalent under rescaling in time. Therefore we can assume g(t) = et/2 and consider the forward SDE for SMLD dxt = et/2dwt, where wt is a standard Brownian Motion. Now let yt = e−t/2xt; then dyt = −1 2ytdt+ dwt, which is exactly DDPM with g(t) = 1. Note that Theorem C.2 uses a diﬀerent parameterization for S MLD and the resulting complexity is slightly worse. C.3 Diﬀerential Inequality Now we prove a diﬀerential inequality involving χ2(qt||pt). As in [Che+21], the key diﬃculty is to bound the discretization error. We decompose it into two error terms and bou nd them in Lemma C.4 and Lemma C.5 separately. In the following, we will let Gkh,t : = ∫ t kh g(T −s)2 ds. (23) Lemma C.3. Let (qt)0≤t≤T denote the law of the interpolation (21). With the setting in Lemma C.1, we have for t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h], d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤g(T −t)2 [( − 1 8Ct + 8ε2 kh ) χ2(qt||pt) + [ 8ε2 kh + E·(t−kh)g(T −kh)2] ] , where Ct is the LSI constant of pt, εkh is the L∞-score estimation error at time kh and E is deﬁned in (24). Proof. By Lemma A.2 with ˆf(zkh,t ) ←−f(zkh,T −t) + g(T −t)2s(zkh,T −kh) f(z,t ) ←−f(z,T −t) + g(T −t)2∇ln ˜pT−t(z), 24we have d dtχ2(qt||pt) = −g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⣨( −f(zkh,T −t) + g(T −t)2s(zkh,T −kh) ) − ( −f(z,T −t) + g(T −t)2∇ln ˜pT−t(z) ) , ∇qt pt ⟩] = −g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⟨ f(zt,T −t) −f(zkh,T −t), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] + 2g(T −t)2E [⟨ s(zkh,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−t(zt), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] =: −g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + A+ B. By Lemma C.4, A≤g(T −t)2 [ 2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 8Ept (qt pt )] , while by Lemma C.5, B ≤1 2g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 8g(T −t)2L2 s(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1). Therefore, for h≤ 1 72g(T−kh)2 (4L2 s+1)( ˜Rt∨2CtRd) ∧ 1 128g(T−kh)2 Cd,L , using Lemma C.15, d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤−3 8g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + g(T −t)2(8L2 s + 2)(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ≤−3 8g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 9g(T −t)2(4L2 s + 1)Gkh,t [ ˜RtEpt (qt pt ) + Rt,kh(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ] + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ≤−2 8g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + g(T −t)2 1 8Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 8g(T −t)2ε2 khχ2(qt||pt) + g(T −t)2 [ 8ε2 kh + 8Cd,LGkh,t + 9(4L2 s + 1)Gkh,tRd ] . Using the fact that pt satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant Ct, d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤− 2 8Ct g(T −t)2χ2(qt||pt) + 1 8Ct g(T −t)2χ2(qt||pt) + 8g(T −t)2ε2 khχ2(qt||pt) + g(T −t)2 [ 8ε2 kh + 8Cd,LGkh,t + 9(4L2 s + 1)Gkh,tRd ] ≤ ( − 1 8Ct + 8ε2 kh ) g(T −t)2χ2(qt||pt) + g(T −t)2[8ε2 kh + E(t−kh)g(T −kh)2]. where E = 9(4L2 s + 1) + 8Cd,L. (24) 25In order to bound the error terms A and B, we will use Lemma A.3. Let φt(x) = qt(x) pt(x) and ψt(x) = φt(x)/ Ept φ2 t. Then Eψt(zt) = 1 and in fact the normalizing factor Ept φ2 t = χ2(qt||pt) + 1. We ﬁrst deal with error term A. Lemma C.4. In the setting of Lemma C.3, we have the following bound for te rm A: 2E [⟨ f(zt,T −t) −f(zkh,T −t), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤g(T −t)2 [ 2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 8Ept (qt pt )] . Proof. In SMLD, f(x,t ) = 0 and hence A = 0; while in DDPM, f(x,t ) = −1 2 g(t)2x. Therefore, by Lemma A.3, 2E [⟨ f(zt,T −t) −f(zkh,T −t), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] = −g(T −t)2E [⟨ zt −zkh, ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤g(T −t)2 [ 2 ·Ept φ2 t ·E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 8Ept (qt pt )] = g(T −t)2 [ 2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 8Ept (qt pt )] . Now we bound error term B. Lemma C.5. In the setting of Lemma C.3, we have the following bound for te rm B: B ≤1 2g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 8g(T −t)2L2 s(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1). Proof. We ﬁrst decompose the error: E [⟨ s(zkh,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−t(zt), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] = E [⟨ s(zkh,T −kh) −s(zt,T −kh), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] + E [⟨ s(zt,T −kh) −∇ln pkh(zt), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] + E [⟨ ∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] =: B1 + B2 + B3. Now we bound these error terms separately. For B1, by the Lipschitz assumption, we have by Lemma A.3, for a constant C2 >0 to be chosen later, B1 ≤E [ Ls∥zkh −zt∥·    ∇qt(zt) pt(zt)     ] ≤4L2 s ·Ept φ2 t ·E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) = 4L2 s(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) . 26For B2, recalling the assumption that ∥s(x,T −kh) −∇ln pkh(x)∥≤ εkh for all x, we have by Lemma A.3 B2 ≤4E [ ∥s(zt,T −kh) −∇ln pkh(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ·Ept [φ2 t] + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) ≤4ε2 kh(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) . (25) Now for the last error term B3, we have by Lemma A.3 that B3 ≤4Ept φ2 t ·E [ ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) ≤4Kt,kh(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) . (26) Here Kt,kh is the bound for E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] obtained in Lemma C.13: Kt,kh := Gkh,t [ Ct,L χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + Cd,L ] where Ct,L and Cd,L are constants deﬁned in (27) and (28) respectively. Hence B3 ≤4Gkh,t [ Ct,LEpt (qt pt ) + Cd,L(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ] + 1 16Ept (qt pt ) . Combining all these results, we ﬁnally obtain the bound for error term Bin Lemma C.3: for h≤ 1 64Ct,L g(T−kh)2 , B = 2g(T −t)2(B1 + B2 + B3) ≤3 8g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 8g(T −t)2L2 s(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 8Ct,Lg(T −t)2Gkh,tEpt (qt pt ) + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ≤1 2g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 8g(T −t)2L2 s(χ2(qt||pt) + 1)E [ ∥zt −zkh∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 8 [ ε2 kh + Gkh,tCd,L ] g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1). C.4 Change of Measure As shown in Lemma C.4 and Lemma C.5, the key to the proof of Lemma C.3 is bounding the discretization error Aand B. The diﬃculty is that these errors usually have the form of Eψtqt [ ∥u(x)∥2 ] for some function u: Rd →Rd, while it is usually easier to bound those expectations over the origina l probability measure or our target distribution pt. Therefore, as discussed in [Che+21, Section 5.1], our task is to bou nd these error terms under a complicated change of measure. We ﬁrst state such a result with respect to the gradient of the potential. Lemma C.6. [Che+21, Lemma 16] Assume that p(x) ∝e−V(x) is a density in Rd and ∇V(x) is L-Lipschitz. Then for any probability density q, it holds that Eq [ ∥∇V∥2 ] ≤4Ep       ∇ √ q(x) p(x)      2 + 2dL= Eq [   ∇ln q(x) p(x)     2] + 2dL. 27Proof. Deﬁne the Langevin diﬀusion w.r.t. p(x): dxt = −∇V(xt) dt+ √ 2 dwt, where Bt is a standard Brownian Motion in Rd. Let Lbe the corresponding inﬁnitesimal generator, i.e., Lf = ⟨∇V, ∇f⟩−∆f. Observe that LV = ∥∇V∥2 −∆V and EpLf = 0 for any f, so Eq [ ∥∇V∥2 ] = EqLV + Eq∆V ≤ ∫ LV (q(x) p(x) −1 ) p(x)dx+ dL= ∫ ⟨ ∇V, ∇q(x) p(x) ⟩ p(x)dx+ dL = 2 ∫ ⟨√ q(x) p(x)∇V, ∇ √ q(x) p(x) ⟩ p(x)dx+ dL ≤1 2Eq [ ∥∇V∥2 ] + 2Ep       ∇ √ q(x) p(x)      2 + dL. Rearrange this inequality to obtain the desired result. Now applying this Lemma to p= pt and q= ψtqt, we get immediately the following corollary. Note that ψtqt is a density function because ∫ ψt(x)qt(x) dx = ∫ qt(x) pt(x) qt(x) dx/ Ept φ2 t = 1 and ψt(x)qt(x) ≥0 for any x∈Rd. Corollary C.7. In the setting of Lemma C.3, it holds that E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤ 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL. Proof. Applying Lemma C.6 to the density ψtqt yields Eψtqt [ ∥∇ln pt(x)∥2 ] ≤Eψtqt [   ∇ln ψt(x)qt(x) pt(x)     2] + 2dL= 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL. Note that we cannot expect analogous results for a general u(x) as in Lemma C.6. In the general case, we apply the Donsker-Varadhan variational principle, which states that for probability measures p and q, Eq∥u(x)∥2 ≤KL(q||p) + lnEpexp ∥u(x)∥2. Towards this end, we ﬁrst need to analyze KL( ψtqt||pt). Lemma C.8. Let φt(x) = qt(x) pt(x) and ψt(x) = φt(x)/ Ept φ2 t. If pt satisﬁes a LSI with constant Ct, then KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ 2Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) . 28Proof. Since pt satisﬁes LSI with constant Ct, KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤Ct 2 ∫    ∇ln ψt(x)qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)qt(x)dx = 2Ct ∫    ∇ln qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)qt(x)dx = 2Ct ∫    ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)pt(x)2 qt(x) dx = 2Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 · ∫    ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2 pt(x)dx = 2Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) . With this in hand, we are ready to bound the second moment of ψtqt as well as the variance of a Gaussian random vector with respect to this measure: Lemma C.9. With the setting of Lemma C.3, we have E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] ≤ 2C2 t χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 1 2Ept [ ∥x∥2 ] + 1 2Ct, where Ct is the LSI constant of pt, which is bounded in Lemma E.6, and the second moment of pt is bounded in Lemma E.8. Proof. Since pt has LSI constant Ct, by Donsker-Varadhan variational principle, E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] = 2 sEψtqt [s 2 ∥x∥2 ] ≤2 s [ KL(ψtqt||pt) + lnEpt [ e s 2 ∥x∥2 ]] for any s> 0. By Lemma E.1, for any s∈[0, 1 Ct ), we have Ept [ e s 2 ∥x∥2 ] ≤ 1√1 −Ct ·sexp [ s 2(1 −Ct ·s)(Ept ∥x∥)2 ] . Now choose s= 1 2Ct , we have Ept [ e s 2 ∥x∥2 ] ≤ √ 2 exp [1 2Ct (Ept ∥x∥)2 ] . Hence E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] ≤Ct · [ KL(ψtqt||pt) + 1 2Ct Ept [ ∥x∥2 ] + ln 2 2 ] . Now with the bound of KL( ψtqt||pt) in Lemma C.8, we obtain E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] ≤ 2C2 t χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 1 2Ept [ ∥x∥2 ] + 1 2Ct. Lemma C.10. With the setting of Lemma C.3, E [ ψt(zt)     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     2] ≤2 ∫ t kh g(T −s)2 ds· [ 8Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + d+ 8 ln 2 ] , where Ct is the LSI constant of pt. 29Proof. Note that ∫t khg(T −s)dws is a Gaussian random vector with variance ∫t khg(T −s)2ds·Id. Using the Donsker-Varadhan variational principle, for any random variable X, ˜EX ≤KL(˜P||P) + lnE exp X. Applying this to X = c (   ∫t khg(T −s)dws   −E    ∫t khg(T −s)dws    ) 2 for a constant c >0 to be chosen later, we can bound ˜E     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     2 ≤2E [    ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     2] + 2 c [ KL(˜P||P) + lnE exp ( c (    ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws    −E     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     ) 2)] , where d˜P dP = ψt(zt). Now following [Che+21, Theorem 4], we set c= 1 8 ∫ t kh g(s)2ds, so that E exp    (   ∫t khg(T −s)dws   −E    ∫t khg(T −s)dws    ) 2 8 ∫t khg(s)2ds   ≤2. Next, using the LSI for pt, we have KL(˜P||P) = Eψtqt ln ψt = Eψtqt ln φt Ept φ2 t = 1 2Eψtqt ln φ2 t (Ept φ2 t)2 = 1 2 [ Eψtqt ln φ2 t Ept φ2 t −ln Ept φ2 t ] = 1 2 [ Eψtqt ln ψtqt pt −ln Ept φ2 t ] . Noting that Ept φ2 t = χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ≥1, we have that KL(˜P||P) ≤1 2 KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) , where the last inequality is due to Lemma C.8. We have proved E [ ψt(zt)     ∫ t kh g(T −s) dws     2] ≤2d ∫ t kh g(T −s)2 ds+ 16 ∫ t kh g(T −s)2ds· [ Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + ln 2 ] ≤2 ∫ t kh g(T −s)2 ds· [ 8Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + d+ 8 ln 2 ] . C.5 Perturbation Error In the previous section, we bound errors in the form of Eψtqt ∥u(x)∥2 with a change of measure technique, where ∥u(x)∥2 is easy to bound with respect to the original measure or pt. However, this is not always the case for the errors we are considering. In this section, we aim to bo und Eψtqt [ ∥∇ln pkh(x) −∇ln pt(x)∥2 ] , where, as discussed in Lemma C.13, pkh can be regarded as a perturbed version of pt with some Gaussian noise. We ﬁrst provide a point-wise bound for SMLD (Lemma C.11) and DDMP (Lemma C.12), respectively and then use them to bound the expectation with respect to ψtqt. 30Lemma C.11. Suppose that p(x) ∝e−V(x) is a probability density on Rd, where V(x) is L-smooth, and let ϕσ2 (x) be the density function of N(0,σ 2Id). Then for L≤ 1 2σ2 ,    ∇ln p(x) (p∗ϕσ2 )(x)    ≤6Lσd1/2 + 2Lσ2 ∥∇V(x)∥. Proof. Note that ∇ln p∗ϕσ2 (x) = ∫ Rd −∇V(y)e−V(y)e− ∥ x−y∥ 2 2σ 2 dy ∫ Rd e−V(y)e− ∥ x−y∥ 2 2σ 2 dy = −Epx,σ 2 ∇V(y), where px,σ2 denotes the probability density px,σ2 (y) ∝p(y)e− ∥ y−x∥ 2 2σ 2 so when V is L-smooth,    ∇ln p(x) p∗ϕσ2 (x)    =   Epx,σ 2 [∇V(y) −∇V(x)]    ≤Epx,σ 2 [L∥y−x∥] We now write Epx,σ 2 ∥y−x∥≤ Epx,σ 2   y−Epx,σ 2 y   +   Epx,σ 2 y−y∗   + ∥y∗ −x∥, where y∗ ∈argmaxypx,σ2 (y) is a mode of the distribution px,σ2 . We now bound each of these terms. 1. For the ﬁrst term, note that px,σ2 is (1 σ2 −L ) -strongly convex, so satisﬁes a Poincar´ e inequality with constant (1 σ2 −L ) −1 . Thus Epx,σ 2 ∥y−x∥≤ Epx,σ 2 [∥y−Epx,σ 2 y∥2]1/2 = ( d∑ i=1 Varpx,σ 2 (yi) ) 1/2 ≤ ( d (1 σ2 −L ) −1) 1/2 . 2. For the second term, by Lemma E.3, noting that V(y) + ∥x−y∥2 2σ2 is (1 σ2 + L ) -smooth,   Epx,σ 2 y−y∗   ≤ (1 σ2 −L ) −1/2 d1/2 ( 5 + ln ((1 σ2 −L ) −1 (1 σ2 + L ) )) 1/2 ≤ (1 σ2 −L ) −1/2 d1/2 ( 5 + ln 1 + Lσ2 1 −Lσ2 ) 1/2 ≤ √ 7 (1 σ2 −L ) −1/2 d1/2, where the last inequality uses σ2 ≤ 1 2L. 313. For the third term, we note that the mode satisﬁes ∇V(y∗) + y∗ −x σ2 = 0 −y∗ −x σ2 = ∇V(y∗) = (∇V(y∗) −∇V(x)) + ∇V(x) 1 σ2 ∥y∗ −x∥≤∥∇ V(x)∥+ L∥y∗ −x∥ ∥y∗ −x∥≤ (1 σ2 −L ) −1 ∥∇V(x)∥. Putting these together and using (1 σ2 −L ) −1 ≤2, we obtain    ∇ln p(x) p∗ϕσ2 (x)    ≤( √ 7 + 1)L (1 σ2 −L ) −1/2 d1/2 + L (1 σ2 −L ) −1 ∥∇V(x)∥ ≤6Lσd1/2 + 2Lσ2 ∥∇V(x)∥. Lemma C.12. With the setting in Lemma C.11 and the notation pα(x) = αdp(αx) for α ≥1, we have that for L≤ 1 2α2σ2 ,    ∇ln p(x) (pα ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    ≤6α2Lσd1/2 + (α + 2α3Lσ2)(α −1)L∥x∥+ (α −1 + 2α3Lσ2) ∥∇V(x)∥. Proof. Note pα(x) is also a probability density in Rd. By the triangle inequality,    ∇ln p(x) (pα ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    ≤    ∇ln p(x) pα(x)    +    ∇ln pα(x) (pα ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    . Without loss of generality, we can assume that p(x) = e−V(x); then pα(x) = αde−V(αx). Hence    ∇ln p(x) pα(x)    = ∥α∇V(αx) −∇V(x)∥ ≤∥α∇V(αx) −α∇V(x)∥+ ∥α∇V(x) −∇V(x)∥ ≤α(α −1)L∥x∥+ (α −1) ∥∇V(x)∥. Since α∇V(αx) is α2L-Lipschitz, by Lemma C.11,    ∇ln pα(x) (pα ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    ≤6α2Lσd1/2 + 2α3Lσ2 ∥∇V(αx)∥. By the Lipschitz assumption, ∥∇V(αx)∥≤∥∇ V(αx) −∇V(x)∥+ ∥∇V(x)∥≤ (α −1)L∥x∥+ ∥∇V(x)∥. The result follows from combining the three inequalities above. Lemma C.13. In the setting of Lemma C.3, we have for t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h], E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤Gkh,t · [ Ct,L χ2(qt||pt) + 1Gkh,tEpt (qt pt ) + Cd,L ] , 32where Ct,L = { 32L2 in SMLD , (88C2 t + 400)L2 in DDPM , (27) and Cd,L = { 76L2d in SMLD , 6 + 94L2d in DDPM ≤100L2d. (28) Proof. In both SMLD and DDPM models, we have the following relationship for t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h]: pkh = (pt)α ∗ϕσ2 . where pα(x) = αdp(αx). In SMLD, α = 1 and σ2 = ∫t khg(T −s)2 ds, while in DDPM, α = e 1 2 ∫ t kh g(T−s)2 ds and σ2 = 1 −e− ∫ t kh g(T−s)2 ds. Now for SMLD, E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤72L2σ2d+ 8L2σ4E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] by Lemma C.11 ≤72σ2L2d+ 32L2σ4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 16σ4L3d by Corollary C.7 ≤G2 kh,t ( 32L2 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 + 16L3d ) + Gkh,t ·72L2d ≤G2 kh,t 32L2 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 + Gkh,t ·76L2d, where in the last inequality we use the fact that g is increasing, so that for h≤ 1 4Lg(T−kh)2 , Gkh,tL= ∫ t kh g(T −s)2 ds·L≤h·g(T −kh)2 ·L≤1 4. Recall that to use Lemma C.11, it suﬃces that L≤ 1 2α2σ2 , and so it suﬃces that h≤ 1 4Lg(T−kh)2 in SMLD. For DDPM, observe that for h≤ 1 4g(T−kh)2 , α ≤1 + ∫ t kh g(T −s)2ds≤1 + (t−kh)g(T −kh)2 ≤1 + 1 4 σ2 = 1 −e− ∫ t kh g(T−s)2 ds ≤ ∫ t kh g(T −s)2ds≤(t−kh)g(T −kh)2 ≤1 4. 33By Lemma C.12, using the assumption that L≥1, we obtain E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤72α4L2σ2d+ 4(α + 2α3Lσ2)2(α −1)2L2E [ ψ(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] + 4(α −1 + 2α3Lσ2)2E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤72α4L2σ2d+ 44L2G2 kh,tE [ ψ(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] + 100L2G2 kh,tE [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤44L2dGkh,t + 44L2 [ 2C2 t χ2(qt||pt) + 1Ept (qt pt ) + 1 2Ept ∥x∥2 + 1 2Ct ] G2 kh,t + 100L2 [ 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL ] G2 kh,t ≤L2Gkh,t [ Gkh,t ( 88C2 t + 400 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ) Ept (qt pt ) + 44d+ Gkh,t ( 22(Ept ∥x∥2 + Ct) + 200Ld ) ] ≤Gkh,t [ Gkh,t 88C2 t + 400 χ2(qt||pt) + 1Ept (qt pt ) + 6 + 94L2d ] , where we used Lemma C.9 and Corollary C.7. Here, we use the assumpt ion that h≤ 1 4g(T−kh)2 (Ept ∥x∥2+Ct) . C.6 Auxiliary Lemmas In this section, we continue with bounding errors in the form of Eψtqt ∥u(x)∥2. However, we only decompose them into errors which we have already bounded in the previous two s ections. The following two lemmas will be directly applied in the proof of Lemma C.4 and Lemma C.5. Lemma C.14. With the setting of Lemma C.3, we have the following bound of t he second moment of estimated score function with respect to ψtqt: E [ ψt(zt) ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥2 ] ≤4Ct,LGkh,t + 8 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 4(ε2 kh + Cd,L + dL), where Ct,L and Cd,L are constants deﬁned in Lemma C.13. Proof. Note that by the triangle inequality, ∥s(x,T −kh)∥≤∥ s(x,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−kh(x)∥ + ∥∇ln ˜pT−kh(x) −∇ln ˜pT−t(x)∥+ ∥∇ln ˜pT−t(x)∥, and hence, ∥s(x,T −kh)∥2 ≤4 ∥s(x,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−kh(x)∥2 + 4∥∇ln ˜pT−kh(x) −∇ln ˜pT−t(x)∥2 + 2∥∇ln ˜pT−t(x)∥2 . 34Recall that we need to bound this second moment of estimated scor e function with respect to ψtqT. For the ﬁrst term, as ∥s(x.T −kh) −∇ln pkh(x)∥is εkh-bounded, we have trivial bound that Eψtqt ∥s(x,T −kh) −∇ln ˜pT−kh(x)∥2 ≤ε2 kh. By Lemma C.13, the second term is bounded by Eψtqt [ ∥∇ln pkh(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤Gkh,t · [ Ct,L χ2(qt||pt) + 1Gkh,tEpt (qt pt ) + Cd,L ] for constant Ct,L and Cd,L deﬁned in (27) and (28) respectively. The last term is bounded in Cor ollary C.7 by E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤ 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL. Combining these three inequalities, we obtain that for h≤ 1 g(T−kh)2 , E [ ψt(zt) ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥2 ] ≤ 4Ct,L + 8 χ2(qt||pt) + 1Gkh,tEpt (qt pt ) + 4(ε2 kh + Cd,L + dL).Now we bound E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt −zkh∥2 ] . Lemma C.15. In the setting of Lemma C.3, if h≤ 1 g(T −kh)2(8L2 + 20L+ 3Ls+ 10Ct + Ept ∥x∥2) , then E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt −zkh∥2 ] ≤9 2Gkh,t [ ˜Rt χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + Rt,kh ] , where ˜Rt and Rd are deﬁned in (30) and (31) respectively. Proof. Note that ∥zt −zkh∥ =    Gkh,ts(zkh,T −kh) − ∫ t kh f(zkh,T −s)ds+ ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     ≤Gkh,t∥s(zkh,T −kh)∥+ 1 2    zkh ∫ t kh g(T −s)2ds    +     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     ≤Gkh,t [ ∥s(zkh,T −kh)∥+ 1 2 ∥zkh∥ ] +     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     ≤Gkh,t [ ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥+ Ls∥zt −zkh∥+ 1 2 ∥zt∥+ 1 2 ∥zt −zkh∥ ] +     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     = Gkh,t [ ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥+ 1 2 ∥zt∥ ] + ( Ls + 1 2 ) g(T −kh)2 ·h∥zt −zkh∥+     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws    , 35where the next-to-last line is due to the fact that the estimated sc ore function is Ls-Lipschitz. We also use the fact that g(t) is an increasing function and hence g(T −t) ≤g(T −kh) for any t∈[kh, (k+ 1)h]. Hence if h≤ 1 3(Ls+1/2)g(T−kh)2 , then ∥zt −zkh∥≤ 3 2Gkh,t [ ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥+ 1 2 ∥zt∥ ] + 3 2     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws    . Therefore, by the fact that ( a+ b)2 ≤2a2 + 2b2 for any a,b> 0, ∥zt −zkh∥2 ≤9 2G2 kh,t [ 2 ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥2 + 1 2 ∥zt∥2 ] + 9 2     ∫ t kh g(T −s)dws     2 . (29) With the results of Lemma C.14 and Lemma C.9, we have 2E [ ψt(zt) ∥s(zt,T −kh)∥2 ] + 1 2E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] ≤8Ct,LGkh,t + C2 t + 16 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 8(ε2 kh + Cd,L + dL) + 1 4Ept ∥x∥2 + 1 4Ct. Now plugging this and the result of Lemma C.10 into (29), we get that E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt −zkh∥2 ] ≤9 2G2 kh,t ·8(ε2 kh + Cd,L + dL) + 9 2G2 kh,t · [8Ct,LGkh,t + C2 t + 16 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 1 4Ept ∥x∥2 + 1 4Ct ] + 9Gkh,t · [ 8Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + d+ 8 ln 2 ] . Hence, using the assumption on h, E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt −zkh∥2 ] ≤9 2Gkh,t [ K1 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + K2 ] , where K1 : = 8Ct,LG2 kh,t + (C2 t + 16)Gkh,t + 16Ct ≤8(88C2 t + 400L2) 1 400L+ 100C2 t + (C2 t + 16) 1 20L+ 10Ct + 8Ct ≤8 + Ct + 1 + 8Ct = 9(Ct + 1) and K2 : = [1 4(Ept ∥x∥2 + Ct) + 8(ε2 kh + Cd,L + dL) ] Gkh,t + 2d+ 16 ln 2 ≤ [1 4(Ept ∥x∥2 + Ct) + 8(ε2 kh + 256L2d+ dL) ] ( 1 Ept ∥x∥2 + Ct + 8L2 ) + 2d+ 16 ln 2 ≤1 4 + 300d+ 16 ln 2≤300d+ 12. Hence the lemma holds by setting ˜Rt = 9(Ct + 1), (30) Rd = 300d+ 12. (31) 36C.7 Proof of Theorem 3.1 We state a more precise version of Theorem 3.1. The structure of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.1. Theorem C.16 (Predictor with L2-accurate score estimate, DDPM) . Let pdata : Rd →R be a probability density satisfying Assumption 1 with M2 = O(d), and let ˜pt be the distribution resulting from evolving the forward SDE according to DDPM with g ≡1. Suppose furthermore that ∇ln ˜pt is L-Lipschitz for every t≥0, and that each s(·,t ) satisﬁes Assumption 2. Then if ε= O ( εTVε3 χ (CLS + d)C5/2 LS (L∨Ls)2(ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln(1/ε 2 TV)) ) , running (P) starting from pprior for time T = Θ ( ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln ( 1 εTV )) and step size h= Θ ( ε2 χ CLS(CLS+d)(L∨Ls)2 ) results in a distribution qT such that qT is εTV-far in TV distance from a distribution qT, where qT satisﬁes χ2(qT||pdata) ≤ε2 χ. In particular, taking εχ = εTV, we have TV(qT||pdata) ≤2εTV. Proof of Theorem C.16. We ﬁrst deﬁne the bad sets where the error in the score estimate is large, Bt : = {∥∇ln pt(x) −s(x,T −t)∥>ε1} (32) for some ε1 to be chosen. Given t≥0, let t− = h ⌊t h ⌋ . Given a bad set B, deﬁne the interpolated process by dzt = − [ f(zt− ,T −t) −g(T −t)2b(zkh,T −kh) ] dt+ g(T −t) dwt, (33) where b(z,t ) = { s(z,t ), z ̸∈Bt ∇ln pt(z), z ∈Bt . In other words, simulate the reverse SDE using the score estimate as long as the point is in the good set (for the current pt) at the previous discretization step, and otherwise use the actua l gradient ∇ln pt. Let qt denote the distribution of zt when z0 ∼q0; note that qnh is the distribution resulting from running LMC with estimate b for n steps and step size h. Note that this process is deﬁned only for purposes of analysis, as we do not have access to ∇ln pt. We can couple this process with the predictor algorithm using s so that as long as xmh ̸∈Bmh, the processes agree, thus satisfying condition 1 of Theorem 4.1. Then by Chebyshev’s inequality, P(Bt) ≤ (ε ε1 ) 2 =: δ. Let T = Nh, and let Kχ = χ2(q0||p0). Then by Theorem 4.3, χ2(qkh||pkh) = exp ( − kh 16CLS ) χ2(q0||p0) + O ( CLS(ε2 1 + (L2 s + L2d)h) ) = exp ( − kh 4CLS ) χ2(µ0||p) + O(1). For this to be bounded by ε2 χ, it suﬃces for the terms to be bounded by ε2 χ 2 , ε2 χ 4 , ε2 χ 4 ; this is implied by T ≥32CLS ln (2Kχ ε2 χ ) =: Tmin h= O ( ε2 χ CLS(CLS + d)(L∨Ls)2 ) ε1 = O ( εχ√CLS ) . 37(We choose h so that the condition in Theorem 4.3 is satisﬁed; note εχ ≤1.) By Theorem 4.1, TV(qnh, qnh) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 (1 + χ2(qkh||p))1/2P(Bkh)1/2 ≤ (n−1∑ k=0 exp ( − kh 32CLS ) χ2(q0||p)1/2 + O(1) ) δ1/2 ≤ ((∞∑ k=0 exp ( − kh 32CLS ) Kχ ) + O(n) ) ε ε1 ≤ ε ε1 (64CLS h Kχ + O(n) ) . In order for this to be ≤εTV, it suﬃces for ε≤ε1εTV ·O (1 n ∧ h CLSKχ ) . Supposing that we run for time T = Θ(Tmin), we have that n= T h = O (CT Tmin h ) . Thus it suﬃces for ε= ε1εTV ·O ( h Tmin ∧ h 32CLSKχ ) = O ( εχ√CLS ·εTV · ε2 χ CLS(CLS + d)(L∨Ls)2 ( 1 CLS ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∧ 1 CLSKχ ) ) = O ( εTVε3 χ C5/2 LS (CLS + d)(L∨Ls)2(ln(2Kχ/ε 2 χ) ∨Kχ) ) . Finally, note that for T = Ω(ln(CLSd)), we have Kχ = O(1) by Lemma E.9. Substituting Kχ = O(1) then gives the desired bound.C.8 Proof of Theorem 3.2 We now prove the main theorem on the predictor-corrector algorit hm with L2-accurate score estimate. Theorem 3.2 (Predictor-corrector with L2-accurate score estimate). Keep the setup of Theorem 3.1. Then for ε3 TV = O ( 1 (1+Ls/L)2(1+CLS/d)(ln(CLSd)∨CLS) ) , if ε= O ( ε4 TV dL2C5/2 LS ln(1/ε 2 χ) ) , (5) then Algorithm 2 with appropriate choices of T = Θ ( ln(CLSd) ∨CLS log ( 1 εTV )) , Nm, corrector step sizes hm and predictor step size h, produces a sample from a distribution qT such that TV(qT,p data) <εTV. For simplicity, we consider the predictor-corrector algorithm in the case where all the corrector steps are at the end (but see the discussion following the proof for the ge neral case). The result will follow from chaining together the guarantee on the predictor algorithm (Theo rem C.16) and LMC (Theorem 2.1). Proof of Theorem 3.2. Let M = T/h . We take h = Θ ( 1 (L∨Ls)2CLS(CLS+d) ) , number of corrector steps N0 = ··· = NT/h−1 = 0 and NM = Tc/h M, where Tc = Θ ( CLS ln ( 2 ε2 χ )) and hM = Θ ( ε2 χ dL2CLS ) . Let the 38distribution of zT,0 be qT,0. By Theorem C.16, if T = Θ(ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln(1/ε TV)), then ε= O ( εTV (L∨Ls)2(CLS + d)C5/2 LS (ln(CLSd) ∨CLS ln(1/ε TV)) ) , then there exists qT,0 such that TV( qT,0, qT,0) = εTV/ 2 and χ2(qT,0||pdata) = 1. Then using Theorem 2.1 with εTV ←εTV/ 2 and Kχ = 1, plus the triangle inequality gives that if ε= O ( εTVε3 χ dL2C5/2 LS ln(1/ε TV) ) , then there is qT such that TV(qT, qT) = εTV and χ2(qT||pdata) = ε2 χ. Finally, setting εTV,ε χ ←εTV/ 2 gives TV(qT,p data) ≤εTV. We note that for ε3 TV = O ( 1 (1+Ls/L)2(1+CLS/d)(ln(CLSd)∨CLS) ) , the second condition on ε is more con- straining, giving the theorem. Remark. We can also analyze a setting where predictor and corrector s teps are interleaved; for instance, if N = 1, then interleaving the one-step inequalities in Theorem 4. 2 and 4.3 gives a recurrence χ2(q(k+1)h,0||p(k+1)h) ≤exp ( −hpred 16CLS ) χ2(qkh,1||pkh) + O(dL2h2 + ε2 1h) χ2(q(k+1)h,1||p(k+1)h)) ≤exp ( −hcorr 4CLS ) χ2(q(k+1)h,0||p(k+1)h) + O(ε2 1h+ (L2 s + L2d)h2); we can then follow the proof of Theorem 3.1. While this does no t improve the parameter dependence under the assumptions of Theorem 3.2, it can potentially allow for larger step sizes (beyond what is allowed by Theorem 3.1), as error accrued in the predictor step can be ex ponentially damped by the corrector step. D Stationary distribution of LD with score estimate can be ar bi- trarily far away We show that the stationary distribution of Langevin dynamics with L2-accurate score estimate can be arbitrarily far from the true distribution. We can construct a coun terexample even in one dimension, and take the true distribution as a standard Gaussian p(x) = 1 √ 2πe−x2/2. We will take the score estimate to also be in the form ∇ln q, so that the stationary distribution of LMC with the score estimate is q. The main idea of the construction is to set q to disagree with p only in the tail of p, where it has a large mode; this error will fail to be detected under L2(p). Theorem D.1. Let pbe the density function of N(0, 1). There exists an absolute constant C such that given any ε> 0, there exists a distribution q such that 1. ln q is C-smooth. 2. Ep[∥∇ln p−∇ln q∥2] <ε 3. TV(p,q ) >1 −ε. Proof. Take a smooth non-negative function g supported on [ −1, 1], with max |g′′|≤ c and g(0) = 1. We consider a family of distributions for L> 0 with density qL(x) ∝e−VL(x), and VL(x) := x2 2 −L2g (2 L(x−L) ) . 39Thus the score function for qL is given by V′ L(x) = x−(2L)g′ (2 L(x−L) ) . We compute the L2(p) error between the score functions associated with p and qL. Ep(V′ L(x) −x)2 = 1√ 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ (2L)2 ⏐ ⏐ ⏐g′ (2 L(x−L) ) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ 2 e−x2/2 dx ≤ 1 √ 2π (2L)2e−L2/8 ∫ ∞ −∞ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐g′ (2 L(x−L) ) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ 2 dx = 1 √ 2π2L3e−L2/8 ∫ ∞ −∞ ⏐ ⏐g′(y) ⏐ ⏐2 dy, where in the ﬁrst inequality we have used that g( 2 L(x−L)) has support [ L 2 , 3L 2 ], since g has support [−1, 1]. Thus the L2(p)-error of the score function goes to 0 as L→∞. Moreover, as ⏐ ⏐V′′ L(x) ⏐ ⏐= ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐1 −4g′′ (2 L(x−L) ) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐≤1 + 4 max y ⏐ ⏐g′′(y) ⏐ ⏐≤1 + 4c, the distribution qL satisﬁes the required smoothness (Lipschitz score) assumption. Note that qL has a large mode concentrated at x= L as VL(L) = L2 2 −L2g(0) = −L2 2 , while p has vanishing density there, which is in fact the reason that L2(p)-loss of the score estimate is not able to detect the diﬀerence between the two distributions. As the height (and width) of the mode becomes arbitrarily large compared to x = 0, we have qL([L 2 , 3L 2 ]) →1, whereas pL([L 2 , 3L 2 ]) →0. Hence TV(pL,q L) →1. E Useful facts In this section, we collect some facts and technical lemmas used thr oughout the paper. E.1 Facts about probability distributions Given a probability measure P on Rd with density p, we say that a Poincar´ e inequality (PI) holds with constant CP if for any probability measure q, χ2(q||p) ≤CPEp (q p ) := CP ∫ Rd    ∇q(x) p(x)     2 p(x)dx. (PI) Alternatively, for any C1 function f, Varp(f) ≤CP ∫ Rd ∥∇f∥2 p(x) dx. We say that a log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) holds with constant CLS if for any probability measure q, KL(q||p) ≤CLS 2 ∫ Rd    ∇ln q(x) p(x)     2 q(x)dx. (LSI) We call the Poincar´ e constant and log-Sobolev constant the smallest CP, CLS for which the inequalities hold for all q. If p satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant, then psatisﬁes a Poincar´ e inequality with the same constant; hence the Poincar´ e constant is at most the log-Sobolev constant, CP ≤CLS. If p ∝e−V is α-strongly log-concave, that is, V ⪰ αId, then p satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant 1 /α . We collect some properties of distributions satisfying LSI or PI. 40Lemma E.1 (Herbst, Sub-exponential and sub-gaussian concentration given log-Sobolev inequality, [BGL13, Pr. 5.4.1]) . Suppose that µ satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant CLS. Let f be a 1-Lipschitz function. Then 1. (Sub-exponential concentration) For any t∈R, Eµetf ≤etEµ f+ CLSt2 2 . 2. (Sub-gaussian concentration) For any t∈ [ 0, 1 CLS ) , Eµe tf2 2 ≤ 1√1 −CLStexp [ t 2(1 −CLSt)(Eµf)2 ] . Lemma E.2 (Gaussian measure concentration for LSI, [BGL13, §5.4.2]). Suppose that µ satisﬁes a log- Sobolev inequality with constant CLS. Let f be a L-Lipschitz function. Then µ(|f −Eµf|≥ r) ≤2e − r2 2CLSL2 . Lemma E.3 ([GLR18, Lemma G.10]) . Let V : Rd →R be a α-strongly convex and β-smooth function and let P be a probability measure with density function p(x) ∝e−V(x). Let x∗ = argminxV(x) and x = EPx. Then ∥x∗ −x∥≤ √ d α (√ ln (β α ) + 5 ) . (34) Theorem E.4 ( [BL02, Theorem 5.1], [Har04]). Suppose the d-dimensional gaussian N(0, Σ) has density γ. Let p= h·γ be a probability density. 1. If h is log-concave, and g is convex, then ∫ Rd g(x−Epx)p(x) dx≤ ∫ Rd g(x)γ(x) dx. 2. If h is log-convex, 1 and g(x) = ⟨x,y ⟩α for some y∈Rd, α> 0, then ∫ Rd g(x−Epx)p(x) dx≥ ∫ Rd g(x)γ(x) dx. Lemma E.5. Let P be a probability measure on Rd with density function psuch that ln pis C1 and L-smooth and P satisﬁes a Poincar´ e inequality with constant CP. Then LCP ≥1. Proof. By the Poincar´ e inequality and Lemma E.4(2), sincepis equal to the density of N(0, 1 LId) multiplied by a log-convex function, CP ≥EP(x1 −EPx1)2 ≥EN(0,1 L Id )x2 1 = 1 L. 1Note that the sign is ﬂipped in the theorem statement in [BL02 ]. 41E.2 Lemmas on SMLD and DDPM We give bounds on several quantities associated with the SMLD and D DPM processes at time t: the log-Sobolev constants (Lemma E.7), the second moment (Lemma E.8 ), and the warm start parameter (Lemma E.9). First, we note that for SMLD and DDPM, the conditional distribution of ˜xt given ˜x0 is SMLD: ˜xt|˜x0 ∼N ( x(0), ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds·Id ) DDPM: ˜xt|˜x0 ∼N ( x(0)e− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds, (1 −e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds)Id ) . Hence ˜pSMLD t = p0 ∗N ( 0, ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds·Id ) (35) ˜pDDPM t = Me− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds#p0 ∗N(0, (1 −e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds)Id) (36) where Mc is multiplication by c. Lemma E.6 ([Cha04]). Let p,p ′ be two probability densities on Rd. If pand p′ satisfy log-Sobolev inequalities with constants CLS and C′ LS, then p∗p′ satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant CLS + C′ LS. Lemma E.7 (Log-Sobolev constant for SMLD and DDPM) . Let ˜pSMLD t and ˜pDDPM t denote the distribution of the SMLD/DDPM processes at time t, when started at p0. Let CLS be the log-Sobolev constant of p0. Then CLS(˜pSMLD t ) ≤CLS + ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds CLS(˜pDDPM t ) ≤(CLS −1)e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds + 1 ≤max{CLS, 1}. Note that the analogous statement for the Poincar´ e constantCP holds for Lemma E.6 and E.7. Proof. Note that if µ has log-Sobolev constant CLS and T is a smooth L-Lipschitz map, then T#µ has log-Sobolev constant ≤L2CLS. Applying Lemma E.6 to (35) and (36) then ﬁnishes the proof. Lemma E.8 (Second moment for SMLD and DDPM) . Suppose that ˜p0 has ﬁnite second moment, then for t∈[0,T ]: E˜pt [ ∥x∥2 ] = E˜p0 [ ∥x∥2 ] + dβ(t) in SMLD, E˜pt [ ∥x∥2 ] = e−β(t)E˜p0 [ ∥x∥2 ] + d(1 −e−β(t)) ≤max { E˜p0 [ ∥x∥2 ] ,d } in DDPM, where β(t) = ∫t 0 g(s)2ds. Proof. Recall that in SMLD, ˜xt ∼N(˜x0,β (t) ·Id). Let y∼N(0,β (t) ·Id) be independent of ˜x0. Then E˜pt [ ∥x∥2 ] = E [ ∥˜x0 + y∥2 ] = E [ ∥˜x0∥2 ] + E [ ∥y∥2 ] = E [ ∥˜x0∥2 ] + dβ(t). In DDMP, ˜xt ∼N(e− 1 2 β(t) ˜x0, (1 −e−β(t)) ·Id). Choose y∼N(0, (1 −e−β(t)) ·Id) independent of ˜x0, then E˜pt [ ∥x∥2 ] = E [  e− 1 2 β(t) ˜x0 + y    2] = E [  e− 1 2 β(t) ˜x0    2] + E [ ∥y∥2 ] = e−β(t)E [ ∥˜x0∥2 ] + d(1 −e−β(t)). 42Lemma E.9 (Warm start for SMLD and DDPM). Suppose that phas log-Sobolev constant at most CLS and ∥Ey∼py∥≤ M1. Let ϕσ2 denote the density of N(0,σ 2Id). Then for any σ2, χ2(ϕσ2 ||p∗ϕσ2 ) ≤4 exp (d(2M1 + 8CLS) σ2 ) Hence, letting σ2 SMLD = ∫t 0 g(s)2 ds and σ2 DDPM = 1 −e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds, χ2(ϕσ2 SMLD ||˜pSMLD t ) ≤4 exp (d(2M1 + 8CLS) σ2 SMLD ) χ2(ϕσ2 DDPM ||˜pDDPM t ) ≤4 exp   d ( 2e− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 dsM1 + 8e− ∫ t 0 g(s)2 dsCLS ) σ2 DDPM  . Proof. Let Rx = ( M1 + 2√ CLS) ∥x∥. For a ﬁxed x, note that Ey∼p⟨y,x ⟩ ≤∥Ey∼py∥∥x∥ ≤M1 ∥x∥by assumption. Then by Lemma E.2, P(⟨y,x ⟩≥Rx) ≤P(|⟨y,x ⟩−Ey∼p⟨y,x ⟩|≥ 2 √ CLS ∥x∥) ≤2e − (2 √ CLS∥ x∥ )2 2CLS∥ x∥ 2 ≤2e−2 ≤1 2. Hence (p∗ϕσ2 )(x) = ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 ∫ Rd e− ∥ x+y∥ 2 2σ 2 p(y) dy ≥ ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 e− ∥ x∥ 2 2σ 2 ∫ Rd e− ⟨x,y ⟩ σ 2 p(y) dy ≥ ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 e− ∥ x∥ 2 2σ 2 ∫ ⟨y,x⟩≤Rx e− ⟨x,y ⟩ σ 2 p(y) dy ≥ ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 e− ∥ x∥ 2 2σ 2 ∫ ⟨y,x⟩≤Rx e−(M1∥x∥+2√CLS∥x∥)/σ2 p(y) dy ≥ ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 e− ∥ x∥ 2 2σ 2 e− ∥ x∥ 2 8σ 2d − 2M2 1 d σ 2 − ∥ x∥ 2 8σ 2d − 8CLSd σ 2 ∫ ⟨y,x⟩≤Rx p(y) dy ≥ ( 1 2πσ2 ) d/2 e − ∥ x∥ 2 2σ 2(1− 1 2d ) −1 e− d(8CLS +2M2 1 ) σ 2 ·1 2 ≥1 2e− d(8CLS+2M2 1 ) σ 2 ( 1 − 1 2d ) d/2 ϕ σ 2 1− 1 2d . Using the fact that χ2(N(0, Σ2)||N(0, Σ1)) = |Σ 1|1/ 2 |Σ 2| |(2Σ−1 2 −Σ−1 1 )|− 1 2 −1, we have χ2(ϕσ2 ||p∗ϕσ2 ) + 1 ≤2 ·e d(8CLS +2M2 1 ) σ 2 ( 1 − 1 2d ) − d 2 [ χ2 ( ϕσ2 ||ϕ σ 2 1− 1 2d ) + 1 ] = 2 ·e d(8CLS +2M2 1 ) σ 2 ( 1 − 1 2d ) − d 2 ( 1 − 1 2d ) − d 2 ( 2 − ( 1 − 1 2d )) − d 2 ≤2 ·e d(8CLS +2M2 1 ) σ 2 ( 1 − 1 2d ) −d ≤4e d(8CLS+2M2 1 ) σ 2 The corollary inequalities then follow from (35) and (36), where for DDPM, we use the fact thatMe− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds#p0 has mean e− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds ·Epx and log-Sobolev constant ( e− 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds)2CLS. 43",

Score-based generative modeling (SGM), as a particular kind of diﬀusion model, uses learned score functions (gradients of the log-pdf) to transform white noise to the data distribution through following a stochatic diﬀerenti al equation. While SGM has achieved state-of-the- art performance for artiﬁcial image and audio generation [S E19; Dat+19; Gra+19; SE20; Son+20; Men+21; Son+21b; Son+21a; Jin+22], including being a key component of text-to-image systems [Ram+22], our theoretical understanding of these models is still nascent . In particular, basic questions on the convergence of the gen erated distribution to the data distribution remain unanswered. Recent theoretical work on SGM has attem pted to answer these questions [De +21; LL T22; De 22], but they either suﬀer from exponential depend ence on parameters or rely on strong as- sumptions on the data distribution such as functional inequ alities or smoothness, which are rarely satisﬁed in practical situations. F or example, considering the hall mark application of generating images from text, we expect the distribution of images to be (a) multimodal, an d hence not satisfying functional inequali- ties with reasonable constants, and (b) supported on lower- dimensional manifolds, and hence not smooth. However, SGM still performs remarkably well in these settin gs. Indeed, this is one relative advantage to other approaches to generative modeling such as generative adversarial networks, which can struggle to learn multimodal distributions [ARZ18]. In this work, we aim to develop theoretical convergence guar antees with polynomial complexity for SGM under minimal data assumptions. 11.1 Problem setting Given samples from a data distribution Pdata, the problem of generative modeling is to learn the distribu tion in a way that allows generation of new samples. A general fram ework for many score-based generative models is where noise is injected into Pdata via a forward SDE [Son+20] d˜xt = f(˜xt,t ) dt+ g(t) dwt, t ∈[0,T ], (1) where ˜x0 ∼˜P0 := Pdata. Let ˜pt denote the density of ˜xt. Remarkably , ˜xt also satisﬁes a reverse-time SDE, d˜xt = [ f(˜xt,t ) −g(t)2∇ln ˜pt(˜xt)] dt+ g(t) d˜wt, t ∈[0,T ], (2) where ˜wt is a backward Brownian motion [And82]. Because the forward p rocess transforms the data distri- bution to noise, the hope is to use the backwards process to tr ansform noise into samples. In practice, when we only have sample access to Pdata, the score function ∇ln ˜pt is not available. A key mechanism behind SGM is that the score function is learnable from data, through empirically minimizing a de-noising objective evaluated at noisy samples ˜xt [Vin11]. The samples ˜xt are obtained by evolving the forward SDE starting from the data samples ˜x0, and the optimization is done within an expressive function class such as neural networks. If the score function is succe ssfully approximated in this way , then the L2-error E˜pt[∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥2] will be small. The natural question is then the following: Given L2-error bounds of the score function, how close is the distrib ution generated by (2) (with score estimate s(x,t ) in place of ∇ln ˜pt, and appropriate discretization) to the data distribution Pdata? W e note it is more realistic to consider L2 rather than L∞-error, and this makes the analysis more challenging. Indeed, prior work on Langevin Monte Carlo [EHZ21] and relat ed sampling algorithms only apply when the score function is known exactly , or with suitable modiﬁcati on, known up to L∞-error. L2-error has a genuinely diﬀerent eﬀect from L∞-error, as it can cause the stationary distribution for Lang evin Monte Carlo to be arbitrarily diﬀferent [LL T22], necessitating a “medium-time\" analysis. In addition, we hope to obtain a result with as few structural assumptions as possible on Pdata, so that it can be useful in realistic scenarios where SGM is applied. 1.2 Prior work on convergence guarantees W e highlight two recent works which make progress on this pro blem. [LL T22] are the ﬁrst to give polynomial convergence guarantees in TV distance under L2-accurate score for a reasonable family of distributions. They introduce a framework to reduce the analysis under L2-accurate score to L∞-accurate score. However, they rely on the data distribution satisfying smoothness co nditions and a log-Sobolev inequality—a strong assumption which essentially limits the guarantees to unim odal distributions. [De 22] instead make minimal data assumptions, giving conve rgence in W asserstein distance for distri- butions with bounded support M. In particular, this covers the case of distributions suppo rted on lower- dimensional manifolds, where guarantees in TV distance are unattainable. However, for general distribu- tions, their guarantees have exponential dependence on the diameter of Mand the inverse of the desired error ( exp(O(diam(M)2/ε ))), and for smooth distributions, an improved, but still expo nential dependence on the growth rate of the Hessian ∇2 ln ˜pt as the noise approaches 0 ( exp( ˜O(Γ)) for distributions with ∇2 ln ˜pt  ≤Γ /σ 2 t). W e note that other works also analyze the generalization err or of a learned score estimate [BMR20; De 22]. This is an important question because without further assum ptions, learning an L2-accurate score estimate requires a number of samples exponential in the dimension. A s this is beyond the scope of our paper, we assume that an L2-accurate score estimate is obtainable. 21.3 Our contributions In this work, we analyze convergence in the most general sett ing of distributions of bounded support, as in [De 22]. W e give W asserstein bounds for any distribution of bounded support (or suﬃciently decaying tails), and TV bounds for distributions under smoothness as sumptions, that are polynomial in all parameters, and do not rely on the data distribution satisfying any funct ional inequality . This gives theoretical grounding to the empirical success of SGM on data distributions that ar e often multimodal and non-smooth. W e streamline the χ2-based analysis of [LL T22], with signiﬁcant changes as to co mpletely remove the use of functional inequalities. In particular, the biggest challenge—and our key improvement—is to bound a certain KL-divergence without reliance on a global functi onal inequality . F or this, we prove a key lemma that distributions which are close in χ2-divergence have score functions that are close in L2 (which may be of independent interest), and then a structural result that the distributions arising from the diﬀusion process can be slightly modiﬁed as to satisfy the desired inequality , through decomposition into distributions that do satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality . Upon ﬁnishing our paper, we learned of a concurrent and indep endent work [Che+22] which obtained theoretical guarantees for score-based generative modeli ng under similarly general assumptions on the data distribution. W e note that although our bounds are obtained under similar assumptions (with our assumption of the score estimate accuracy slightly weaker than theirs) , our proof techniques are quite diﬀerent. F ollowing the “bad set” idea from [LL T22], we derived a change-of-meas ure inequality with Theorem 7.1, while the analysis in [Che+22] is based on the Girsanov approach. 2 Main results T o state our results, we will consider a speciﬁc type of SGM ca lled denoising diﬀusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) [HJA20], where in the forward SDE (1), f(x,t ) = −1 2 g(t)2x for some non-decreasing function g to be chosen. The forward process is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck p rocess with time rescaling: ˜xt has the same distribution as mt˜x0 + σtz, where mt = exp [ −1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds ] , σ2 t = 1 −exp [ − ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds ] , and z ∼N(0,I ). (3) Given an estimate score function s(x,t ) approximating ∇ln ˜pt(x), we can simulate the reverse process (repa- rameterizing t←/mapsfromcharT −t and denoting pt := ˜pT−t) dxt = 1 2 g(T −t)2 (xt + 2∇ln pt(xt)) dt+ g(T −t) dwt (4) with the exponential integrator discretization [ZC22], wh ere hk = tk+1 −tk and ηk+1 ∼N(0,I d): ztk+1 = ztk + γ1,k(ztk + 2s(T −tk,z tk)) + √γ2,k ·ηk+1, (5) where γ1,k = exp [ 1 2Gtk,tk+1 ] −1, γ2,k = exp [ Gtk,tk+1 ] −1, and Gt′,t := ∫ t t′ g(T −s)2 ds. (6) W e initialize z0 with a prior distribution that approximates p0 = ˜pT for suﬃciently large T: z0 ∼q0 = pprior : = N(0,σ 2 TId) ≈N(0,I d). (7) While we focus on DDPM, we note that the continuous process un derlying DDPM is equivalent to that of score-matching Langevin diﬀusion (SMLD) under reparamete rization in time and space (see [LL T22, §C.2]). W e will further take g≡1 for convenience in stating our results. Our goal is to obtain a quantitative guarantee for the distan ce between the distribution qtK for ztK (for appropriate tK ≈T) and Pdata, under a L2-score error guarantee. In the following, we assume a sequen ce of discretization points 0 = t0 <t1 <··· <tK ≤T has been chosen. 3Assumption 1 (L2 score error) . For any t∈{T−t0,...,T −tK}, the error in the score estimate is bounded in L2(˜pt): ∥∇ln ˜pt −s(·,t )∥2 L2(˜pt) = E˜pt[∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥2] ≤ε2 t := ε2 σ σ4 t . W e note that the gradient ∇ln ˜pt grows as 1 σ2 t as t→0, so this is a reasonable assumption, and quanti- tatively weaker than a uniform bound over t. Assumption 2 (Bounded support) . Pdata is supported on BR(0) := { x∈Rd : ∥x∥≤ R } . F or simplicity , we assume bounded support when stating our m ain theorems, but note that our results generalize to distributions with suﬃciently fast power dec ay . In the application of image generation, pixel values are bounded, so Assumption 2 is satisﬁed with R typically on the order of √ d. These are the only assumptions we need to obtain a polynomial complexity guarantee. W e also consider the following stronger smoothness assumption, which is Ass umption A.6 in [De 22] and will give better dependencies. Note that [De 22, Theorem I.8] shows a (nonuni form) version of Assumption 3 holds when p0 is a smooth density on a convex submanifold. Assumption 3. The following bound of the Hessian of the log-pdf holds for an y t> 0 and x:  ∇2 ln pt(x)  ≤ C σ2 t , for some constant C >0. Finally , the following smoothness assumption on ˜p0 will allow us to obtain TV guarantees. Assumption 4. Pdata admits a density ˜p0 ∝e−V(x) where V(x) is L-smooth. W e are now ready to state our main theorems. Algorithm 1 DDPM with exponential integrator [Son+20; ZC22] INPUT: Time T; discretization points 0 = t0 <t1 <··· <tN ≤T; score estimates s(·,T −tk); radius R; function g (default: g≡1) Draw z0 ∼pprior from the prior distribution pprior given by (7). for k from 1 to N do Compute ztk from ztk−1 using (5). end for Let ˆztN = ztN if ztN ∈BR(0); otherwise, let ˆztN = 0 . Theorem 2.1 (W asserstein+TV error for distributions with bounded supp ort). Suppose that Assumption 1 and 2 hold with R ≥ √ d. Then there is a sequence of discretization points 0 = t0 < t1 < ··· < tN < T with N = O(poly(d,R, 1/ε TV, 1/ε W)) such that if εσ = ˜O ( ε6.5 TV ε5 W R9d2.25 ) , then the distribution qtN of the output ztN of DDPM is εTV-close in TV distance to a distribution that is εW in W2-distance from Pdata. If in addition Assumption 3 holds with C ≥R2, it suﬃces for εσ = ˜O ( ε4 TV C2d ) (note that the ˜O(·) hides logarithmic dependence on εW). This result is perhaps surprising at ﬁrst glance, as it is wel l known that for sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo, structural assumptions on the target distribution—such as a log-Sobolev inequality— are required to obtain similar theoretical guarantees, eve n with the knowledge of the exact score function. The key reason that we can do better is that we utilize a sequence of score functions st along the reverse SDE, which is not available in standard sampling settings. M oreover, we choose T large enough so that q0 = pprior is close to p0, and it suﬃces to track the evolution of the true process (2), that is, maintain rather 4than decrease the error. T o some extent, this result shows th e power of DDPM and other reverse SDE-based methods compared with generative modeling based on standar d Langevin Monte Carlo. A statement with more precise dependencies, and which works for unbounded distributions with suﬃ- ciently decaying tails, can be found as Theorem 7.2. W e note t hat under the Hessian bound (Assumption 3), up to logarithmic factors, the same score error bound suﬃces to obtain a ﬁxed TV distance to a distribu- tion arbitrarily close in W2 distance. By truncating the resulting distribution, we can also obtain purely W asserstein error bounds. Theorem 2.2 (W asserstein error for distributions with bounded support ). In the same setting as Theo- rem 2.1, consider the distribution ˆqtN of the truncated output ˆxtN of DDPM. If Assumptions 1 and 2 hold with R≥ √ d and εσ = ˜O ( ε18 W R22d2.25 ) , then with appropriate (polynomial) choice of parameters, W2(ˆqtK,P data) ≤ εW. If in addition Assumption 3 holds with C ≥R2, then εσ = ˜O ( ε8 W C2R8d ) suﬃces. With an extra assumption on the smoothness of Pdata, we can also obtain purely TV error bounds: Theorem 2.3 (TV error for distributions under smoothness assumption) . Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 4 hold, Pdata is subexponential (with a ﬁxed constant), and denote R= max {√ d, EPdata ∥X∥ } . Then there is a sequence of discretization points 0 = t0 < t1 < ··· < tN < Twith N = O(poly(d,R, 1/ε TV)) such that if εσ = ˜O ( ε11.5 TV R14d2.25L5 ) , then TV(qtN,P data) ≤εTV. If in addition Assumption 3 holds with C ≥R2, then εσ = ˜O ( ε4 TV C2d ) suﬃces. A more precise statement can be found as Theorem 7.3, which al so works more generally with suﬃcient tail decay . W e note that this result can be derived directly b y combining Theorem 7.2 and a TV error bound between Pdata and ptN (Lemma 6.4) depending on the smoothness of Pdata. 3 Proof overview Our proof uses the framework by [LL T22] to convert guarantee s under L∞-accurate score function to under L2-accurate score function. F or the analysis under L∞-accurate score function, we interpolate the discrete process with estimated score, zt ∼qt, and derive a diﬀerential inequality d dtχ2(qt||pt) = −g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⟨ g(T −t)2(s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩] . W e bound resulting error terms, making ample use of the Donsk er-V aradhan variational principle to con- vert expectations to be under pt. Under small enough step sizes, this shows that χ2(qt||pt) grows slowly (Theorem 4.10), which suﬃces as χ2-divergence decays exponentially in the forward process. The most challenging error term to deal with is the KL diverge nce term KL(qtψt||pt). Our main innovation over the analysis of [LL T22] is bounding this term without a g lobal log-Sobolev inequality for pt. W e note that it suﬃces for pt to be a mixture of distributions each satisfying a log-Sobol ev inequality , with the logarithm of the minimum mixture weight bounded below, and in Lemma 5.2 , we show that we can decompose any distributed of bounded support in this manner if we move a sma ll amount of its mass. In Section 6, we show that this does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect th e estimate of the score function, by interpret- ing the score function as solving a Bayesian inference probl em: that of de-noising a noised data point. More precisely , we show in Lemma 6.5 that the diﬀerence between th e score functions of two diﬀerent distributions can be bounded in L2 in terms of their χ2-divergence, which may be of independent interest. Finally , we reduce from the L2 to L∞ setting by bounding the probabilities of hitting a bad set wh ere the score error is large, and carefully choose parameters (S ection 7). This gives a TV error bound to ˜pδ—the forward distribution at small positive time. Finally , we ca n bound the W asserstein distance of ˜pδ to ˜P0 (in the general case) or the TV distance (under additional smoot hness of ˜P0.) 5In Section A we show that the Hessian is always bounded by O ( d σ2 t ) with high probability (cf. Assump- tion 3). W e speculate that a high-probability rather than un iform bound on the Hessian (as in Lemma 4.13) can be used to obtain better dependencies, and leave this as a n open problem. Notation and deﬁnitions W e let ˜pt denote the density of ˜xt under the forward process (1). Note that x0 ∼˜P0 may not admit a density , but ˜xt will for t> 0. F or the reverse process, we use the notation pt = ˜pT−t, xt = ˜xT−t. W e deﬁned mt and σt in (3), mt = exp [ −1 2 ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds ] , σ 2 t = 1 −exp [ − ∫ t 0 g(s)2 ds ] , and note that ˜pt = ( Mmt♯˜P0) ∗ϕσ2 t , where Mm(x) = mx denotes multiplication by m, F♯P denotes the pushforward of the measure P by F, and ϕσ2 is the density of N(0,σ 2Id). When g≡1, we note the bound σ2 t ≤min{1,t }and σ2 t = Θ(min {1,t }). W e will let zt denote the (interpolated) discrete process (see (12)) and l et qt be the density of zt. W e deﬁne φt(x) = qt(x) pt(x) , ψ t(x) = φt(x) Eptφ2 t , (8) and note that qtψt is a probability density . W e deﬁned Gt′,t = ∫t t′ g(T −s)2 ds in (6). W e denote the estimated score function by either s(x,t ) and st(x) interchangeably . A random variable X is subgaussian with constant C if C = ∥X∥ψ2 : = inf { t> 0 : E exp(X2/t 2) ≤2 } <∞. A Rd-valued random variable X is subgaussian with constant C if for all v ∈Sd−1, ⟨X,v ⟩is subgaussian. W e also deﬁne ∥X∥2,ψ2 : = ∥∥X∥2∥ψ2 . Given a probability measure P on Rd with density p, the associated Dirichlet form is Ep(f,g ) :=∫ Rd ⟨∇f, ∇g⟩P(dx) = ∫ Rd ⟨∇f, ∇g⟩p(x) dx; denote Ep(f) = Ep(f,f ). we say that a log-Sobolev inequal- ity (LSI) holds with constant CLS if for any probability density q, KL(q||p) ≤CLS 2 Ep (q p, ln q p ) = CLS 2 ∫ Rd    ∇ln q(x) p(x)     2 q(x) dx. (9) Note ∫ Rd   ∇ln q(x) p(x)    2 q(x) dx is also known as the Fisher information of q with respect to p. Alternatively , deﬁning the entropy by Entp(f) = Epf(x) ln f(x) −Epf(x) ln Epf(x), for any f ≥0, Entp(f) ≤CLS 2 Ep(f, ln f) = CLS 2 ∫ Rd ∥∇ln f(x)∥2 f(x)p(x)dx. (10) 4 DDPM with L∞-accurate score estimate W e consider the error between the exact backwards SDE (4) and the exponential integrator with estimated score (5). In this section, we bound the error assuming that t he score estimate s is accurate in L∞. 6Assumption 5 (L∞ score error) . For any t ∈{T −t0,...,T −tK}, the error in the score estimate is bounded: ∥∇ln ˜pt −s(·,t )∥∞ = sup x∈Rd ∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥≤ ε2 ∞,t (11) for some non-decreasing function ε2 ∞,t. In Section 7, we will relax this condition to score function b eing accurate in L2. First, we construct the following continuous-time process which interpolates the discrete-time process (5), for t∈[tk,t k+1]: dzt = g(T −t)2 (1 2zt + s(ztk,T −tk) ) dt+ g(T −t) dwt. (12) Integration gives that zt −ztk = ( exp (1 2Gtk,t ) −1 ) (ztk + 2s(ztk,T −tk)) + ∫ t tk exp ( 1 2 ∫ t′ tk g(T −t′′)2 dt′′ ) g(t′) dwt′ , (13) where Gt′,t is deﬁned in (6). Letting qt be the distribution of zt and pt be the distribution of xt, we have by [LL T22, Lemma A.2] that d dtχ2(qt||pt) = −g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 2E [⟨ g(T −t)2(s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt), ∇qt(x) pt(x) ⟩] . (14) (Note that in our case, ˆf also depends on zt rather than just ztk, but this does not change the calculation.) Deﬁne φt,ψ t as in (8): φt(x) = qt(x) pt(x) , ψt(x) = φt(x) Eptφ2 t . T o bound (14), we use the following lemma. Lemma 4.1 (cf. [EHZ21, Lemma 1], [LL T22, Lemma A.3]) . For any C >0 and any Rd-valued random variable u, we have E [⟨ u, ∇qt(zt)pt(zt) ⟩] ≤C·(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ·E [ ∥u∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt (qt pt ) . Proof. By Y oung’s inequality , E [⟨ u, ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] = E [⟨ u √ qt(zt) pt(zt), √ pt(zt) qt(zt) ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤CE [ ∥u∥2 qt(zt) pt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt [    ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2] = CEptφ2 t ·E [ ∥u∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt (qt pt ) = C(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ·E [ ∥u∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 4CEpt (qt pt ) . 7Lemma 4.2. Suppose that (11) holds for t = T −tk, ∇ln ptk(x) is LT−tk-Lipschitz, g is non-decreasing, and that hk ≤ 1 20LT−tkg(T−tk)2 . Then we have for t∈[tk,t k+1] that d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤−1 2g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 12g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) · [ ε2 ∞,T−tk + 16G2 tk,tL2 T−tk [ E[ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2] + 16 E[ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(xt)∥2] ] + 64Gtk,tL2 T−tk(8 KL(ψtqt||pt) + 2 d+ 16 ln 2) + E [ ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ] . Proof. W e bound the second term on the RHS of (14). By Lemma 4.1, E [⟨ s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt), ∇qt(zt) pt(zt) ⟩] ≤(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) E [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] + 1 4 Ept (qt pt ) . (15) Now ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ≤3 [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln ptk(ztk)∥2 + ∥∇ln ptk(ztk) −∇ln ptk(zt)∥2 + ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤3 [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln ptk(ztk)∥2 + L2 T−tk ∥ztk −zt∥2 + ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] and E [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln ptk(ztk)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ≤ε2 ∞,T−tk by deﬁnition of ε∞,t, so by Lemma 4.3, E [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ≤3 [ ε2 ∞,T−tk + L2 T−tkE [ ∥zt −ztk∥2 ψt(zt) ] + E [ ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ]] ≤3 [ ε2 ∞,T−tk + 16G2 tk,tL2 T−tk [ E[ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2] + 4 E[ψt(zt) ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2] + 16E[ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(xt)∥2] ] + 64Gtk,tL2 T−tk(8 KL(ψtqt||pt) + 2 d+ 16 ln 2) + E [ ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ] The condition on hk and the fact that g is non-decreasing implies 192G2 tk,tL2 T−tk ≤1 2 . Rearranging gives E [ ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ≤6 [ ε2 ∞,T−tk + 16G2 tk,tL2 T−tk [ E[ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2] + 16 E[ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(xt)∥2 ] + 64Gtk,tL2 T−tk(8 KL(ψtqt||pt) + 2 d+ 16 ln 2) + E [ ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ψt(zt) ] ] Substituting into (15) and that inequality into (14) give th e conclusion. 8Lemma 4.3. Suppose that hk ≤ 1 2g(T−tk)2 . Then for t∈[tk+1,t k], E [ ∥zt −ztk∥2 ψt(zt) ] ≤16G2 tk,t [ E[ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2] + 4 E[ψt(zt) ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2] + 16E[ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2] ] + 64Gtk,t(8 KL(ψtqt||pt) + 2 d+ 16 ln 2) . Proof. Consider (13). The assumption on hk implies Gtk,t ≤Gtk,tk+1 ≤1 2 , so exp (1 2 Gtk,t ) −1 ≤Gtk,t. Let Y denote the last term of (13). Then ∥zt −ztk∥≤ Gtk,t[∥ztk∥+ 2 ∥s(ztk,T −tk)∥] + ∥Y∥ ≤Gtk,t[∥zt∥+ ∥ztk −zt∥+ 2 ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥+ 2 ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥] + ∥Y∥. Again using Gtk,t ≤1 2 , rearranging gives ∥zt −ztk∥≤ 2Gtk,t[∥zt∥+ 2 ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥+ 4 ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥] + 2 ∥Y∥, and E [ ∥zt −ztk∥2 ψt(zt) ] ≤16G2 tk,t [ E[ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2] + 4 E[ψt(zt) ∥s(ztk,T −tk) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2] + 16E[ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(xt)∥2] ] + 16E[ψt(zt) ∥Y∥2]. By Lemma 4.4, E[ψt(zt) ∥Y∥2] ≤4Gtk,t(8 KL(ψtqt||pt) + 2 d+ 16 ln 2) . The lemma follows. Lemma 4.4.

(Note that this calculation shows that the continuous-time process (12) does agree with the discrete-time process (5) at t= tk+1.) Using the Donsker-V aradhan variational principle, for a ny random variable X, ˜EX ≤KL(˜P||P) + ln E exp X. Applying this to X = c(∥Y∥−E ∥Y∥)2 for a constant c >0 to be chosen later, and ˜P such that d˜P dP (zt) = ψt(zt), we can bound ˜E ∥Y∥2 ≤2E [ ∥Y∥2 ] + 2 ˜E [ (Y −E ∥Y∥)2] ≤2E [ ∥Y∥2 ] + 2 c [ KL(˜P||P) + ln E exp ( c(∥Y∥−E ∥Y∥)2 )] (16) ≤2d(exp(Gtk,t) −1) + 2 c [ KL(˜P||P) + ln E exp ( c(∥Y∥−E ∥Y∥)2 )] . (17) 9Now following [Che+21, Theorem 4], we set c= 1 8(exp(Gtk,t )−1) , so that E [ (∥Y∥−E ∥Y∥)2 8(exp(Gtk,t) −1) ] ≤2. Next, we have KL(˜P||P) = Eψtqt ln ψt = Eψtqt ln φt Eptφ2 t = 1 2 Eψtqt ln φ2 t (Eptφ2 t)2 = 1 2 [ Eψtqt ln φ2 t Eptφ2 t −ln Eptφ2 t ] = 1 2 [ Eψtqt ln ψtqt pt −ln Eptφ2 t ] . Noting that Eptφ2 t = χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ≥1, we have that KL(˜P||P) ≤1 2 KL(ψtqt||pt). Substituting everything into (17) gives the desired inequa lity . Let Kz = E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] (18) KV = E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] (19) K∆ V = E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] (20) K = KL( ψtqt||pt). (21) In order to bound the RHS in Lemma 4.2, we need to bound all four of these quantities, which we do in Lemma 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, and Section 5, respectively . The main in novation in our analysis compared to [LL T22] is a new way to bound K, which we present in a separate section. First we bound Kz. Recall the norm ∥X∥2,ψ2 = inf { L> 0 : Ee ∥ X∥ 2 2 L2 ≤2 } . (In other words, this is the usual Orlicz norm applied to ∥X∥2.) Lemma 4.5. For t∈[tk,t k+1], E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] ≤∥xt∥2 2,ψ2 ·[KL(ψtqt||pt) + ln 2] . Proof. By the Donsker-V aradhan variational principle, E [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] = 2 sEψtqt [ s 2 ∥x∥2 ] ≤2 s [ KL(ψtqt||pt) + ln Ept [ e s 2 ∥x∥2 ]] for any s> 0. Choosing s= 2 ∥xt∥−2 2,ψ2 , we have Ept [ e s 2 ∥x∥2 ] ≤2, which gives the desired inequality . The following bounds KV; note that the proof does not depend on the deﬁnition of qt, only that it is a probability density . Lemma 4.6 ([LL T22, Corollary C.7], [Che+21, Lemma 16]) . E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤ 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL. 10W e use the following lemma to bound K∆ V in Lemma 4.8. Lemma 4.7 ([LL T22, Lemma C.12]) . Suppose that p(x) ∝e−V(x) is a probability density on Rd, where V(x) is L-smooth. Let pα(x) = αdp(αx) and ϕσ2 (x) denote the density function of N(0,σ 2Id). Then for σ2 ≤ 1 2α2L,    ∇ln p(x) (pα ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    ≤6α2Lσd1/2 + (α + 2α3Lσ2)(α −1)L∥x∥+ (α −1 + 2 α3Lσ2) ∥∇V(x)∥. Lemma 4.8. Suppose that hk ≤ 1 4Lg(T−tk)2 where ∇ln pt is LT−t-smooth ( LT−t ≥1) and L= max t∈[tk,tk+1] LT−t. For t∈[tk,t k+1], E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤25L2 T−t ( 8Gtk,td+ G2 tk,tE [ ψt(zt) ∥zt∥2 ]) + 100L2 T−tG2 tk,tE [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] Proof. W e have the following relationship for t∈[tk,t k+1]: ptk = ( pt)α ∗ϕσ2 . where pα(x) = αdp(αx), α = e 1 2 ∫ t tk g(T−s)2 ds and σ2 = 1 −e− ∫ t tk g(T−s)2 ds. Observe that since hk ≤ 1 4g(T−tk)2 , α ≤1 + ∫ t tk g(T −s)2ds≤1 + hkg(T −tk)2 ≤1 + 1 4 σ2 = 1 −e− ∫ t tk g(T−s)2ds ≤ ∫ t tk g(T −s)2ds≤hkg(T −tk)2 ≤1 4 . W e note that σ2 ≤hkg(T −tk)2 ≤ 1 4Lt ≤ 1 2α2Lt so the hypothesis of Lemma 4.7 is satisﬁed. Using Lemma 4.7, w e obtain E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln ptk(zt) −∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤72α4L2 T−tσ2d+ 4(α + 2α3LT−tσ2)2(α −1)2L2 T−tE [ ψ(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] + 4(α −1 + 2 α3LT−tσ2)2E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤72(5/ 4)4L2 T−tGtk,td+ 4(2α)2G2 tk,tL2 T−tE [ ψ(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] + 4(Gtk,t + 4LT−tGtk,t)2E [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] ≤200L2 T−tdGtk,t + 25L2 T−tG2 tk,tE [ ψ(zt) ∥zt∥2 ] + 100L2 T−tG2 tk,tE [ ψt(zt) ∥∇ln pt(zt)∥2 ] . Now we put everything together. W rite Gt = Gtk,t for short. Suppose Lt is non-increasing. By Lemma 4.2, d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤−1 2g(T −t)2Ept (qt pt ) + 12g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ·E where E ≤16G2 tL2 T−tk(Kz + 16KV) + 64 GtL2 T−tk(8K+ 2d+ 16 ln 2) + ε2 ∞,T−tk + K∆ V. 11By Lemma 4.8, K∆ V ≤25L2 T−t(8Gtd+ G2 tKz) + 100 L2 T−tG2 tKV, so E ≤41G2 tL2 T−tKz + 356G2 tL2 T−tKV + 64GtL2 T−t(8K+ 6d+ 16 ln 2) + ε2 ∞,T−tk. By Lemma 4.5, Kz ≤∥xt∥2 2,ψ2 (K+ ln 2) , and by Corollary 4.6, KV ≤ 4 χ2(qt||pt)+1 ·Ept ( qt pt ) + 2dL, so E ≤41G2 tL2 T−t ( ∥xt∥2 2,ψ2 (K+ ln 2) ) + 356G2 tL2 T−t ( 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 2dL ) + 64GtL2 T−t(8K+ 6d+ 16 ln 2) + ε2 ∞,T−tk. Now, if hk ≤ ε′ hk 20g(T−tk)2LT−tk+1 , then E ≤ε′ hk 2 [ ∥xt∥2 2,ψ2 (K+ ln 2) + ( 4 χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + 2dLT−t )] + 4ε′ hkLT−t(8K+ 2d+ 16 ln 2) + ε2 ∞,T−tk. Let MT−t := ∥xt∥2 2,ψ2 . Assume that K ≤ AT−t χ2(qt||pt)+1 + BT−t. Then we obtain 12g(T −t)2(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) ·E ≤12g(T −t)2 [ Ept (qt pt ) (ε′ hk 2 ·(AT−tMT−t + 4) + ε′ hk ·32LT−tAT−t) + (χ2(qt||pt) + 1)( ε′ hk 2 ·((BT−t + ln 2) MT−t + 2dL) + ε′ hk ·LT−t(8BT−t + 6d+ 16 ln 2)) + ε2 ∞,T−tk ] . If ε′ hk ≤min { 1 √ 48(AT−tMT−t+4) , 1 128LT−tAT−t } , then d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤12g(T −t)2 [ (χ2(qt||pt) + 1)( ε′ hk 2 ·((BT−t + ln 2) MT−t + 2dLT−t) + ε′ hk ·LT−t(8BT−t + 6d+ 16 ln 2)) + ε2 ∞,T−tk ] . If ε′ hk ≤min { √ ε′ g(T−t) √ 24(T−tk)((BT−t+ln 2)MT−t+2dLT−t) , ε′ 24g(T−t)2(T−t)LT−t(8BT−t+6d+16 ln 2) } , we get d dtχ2(qt||pt) ≤ ε′ T −t(χ2(qt||pt) + 1) + ε2 ∞,T−tkg(T −t)2. Integration gives χ2(qtk||ptk) ≤eε′ ∫ tk 0 1 T−t dt(χ2(q0||p0) + 1) + ∫ tk 0 e ∫ tk t ε′ T−s dsε2 T−tg(T −t)2 dt ≤ ( T T −tk )ε′ χ2(q0||p0) + (( T T −tk )ε′ −1 ) + ∫ tk 0 (T −t T −tk )ε′ ε2 T−tg(T −t)2 dt. T aking ε′ = ε ln ( T T−tN ) then gives the following Theorem 4.10. W e ﬁrst introduce a te chnical assumption. Deﬁnition 4.9. Let f : R>0 →R>0. We say that f has at most power growth and decay (with some constant c> 0) if maxu∈[ t 2 ,t] f(u) ∈ [ f(t) c ,cf (t) ] . 12Theorem 4.10. Suppose that the following hold. 1. Assumption 5 holds for ε∞,t. 2. ∥˜xt∥2 2,ψ2 ≤Mt. 3. The KL bound KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ AT−t χ2(qt||pt)+1 + BT−t holds for any density qt and t<t N, where ψt(x) = qt(x)/pt(x) χ2(qt||pt)+1 . 4. g(t),A t,B t,L t,M t have at most polynomial growth and decay (with some constant c). Then there is some constant c′ (depending on c) such that if the step sizes satisfy hk ≤min { T −tk 2 , c′ε′ hk g(T −tk)2LT−tk } , where ε′ hk = min { 1 √ AT−tkMT−tk + 1 , 1 LT−tkAT−tk , √ ε/ ln ( T T−tN ) g(T −tk) √ (T −tk)((BT−tk + 1)MT−tk + dLT−tk) , ε/ ln ( T T−tN ) g(T −tk)2(T −tk)LT−tk(BT−tk + d) } , then for 0 ≤k≤N, χ2(qtk||ptk) ≤eεχ2(q0||p0) + ( eε −1) + eε ∫ tk 0 ε2 ∞,T−tg(T −t)2 dt. Proof. This follows from the above calculations and the observatio n that if we replace F(T−t) by F(T−tk), for some F satisfying the power growth and decay assumption, then we ch ange the bound by at most a constant factor, because the step size satisﬁes hk = tk+1 −tk ≤T−tk 2 . W e specialize this theorem in the case of distributions with bounded support. Note that although not every initial distribution ˜pt may satisfy a KL inequality as required by condition 3 of Theo rem 30, Lemma 5.2 will give the existence of a distribution that does, and is cl ose in TV-error. Later in Section 6, we show that this will have a small eﬀect on the score function, and hence a llow us to prove our main theorems. Corollary 4.11. Suppose that Assumptions 5 and 2 hold, R2 ≥d, g ≡1, and that ˜P0 is such that the KL inequality (30) holds. Let δ= T −tN. If 0 <δ,ε< 1 2 , hk = O ( ε max{T−tk,(T−tk)−3}R4dln(T δ ) ln ( R δεK ) ) , then for any 0 ≤k≤N, χ2(qtk||ptk) ≤eεχ2(q0||p0) + ε+ eε ∫ tk 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt. Proof. F or g≡1, note that σ2 T−t = Θ(min {T −t, 1}). F rom Lemma 4.13, we can choose Lt = R2 σ4 t = O ( R2 min{(T −t)2, 1} ) . F rom Lemma 4.15, we can choose Mt = max {R2,d }. 13The KL inequality (30) gives us At = 6( e+ 1)σ2 t = O(min{T −t, 1}) Bt = ln (1 ε ) + dln ( 1 + O ( R√T −tN )) W e now check the requirements on hk. W e need ε′ hk = O ( 1 √ AT−tkMT−tk + 1 ) ⇐= ε′ hk = O ( 1 max{R, √ d} ) (22) ε′ hk = O ( 1 LT−tkAT−tk ) ⇐= ε′ hk = O (T −tk R2 ) (23) ε′ hk = O   √ ε/ ln (T δ ) √ (T −tk)((BT−tk + 1)MT−tk + dLT−tk)  . (24) F or T −tk ≤1, (24) is implied by ε′ hk = O     √ ε/ ln (T δ ) √ (T −tk) ( ln ( 1 εK ) + dln (R δ )) max{R2,d }+ dR2 T−tk     ⇐= ε′ hk = O       √ ε(T −tk) dmax{R2,d }ln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )   , and for T −tk >1, ε′ hk = O   √ ε/ ln (T δ ) √ T ( ln (1 ε ) + dln (R δ )) max{R2,d }+ dR2   ⇐= ε′ hk = O   √ ε Tdmax{R2,d }ln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )  . Finally , the last requirement is ε′ hk = O ( ε/ ln (T δ ) (T −tk)LT−tk(BT−tk + d) ) ⇐= ε′ hk = O   ε R2 max{T −tk, (T −tk)−1}dln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )  . As long as R2 = Ω( d) and ε <1, the last equation implies all the others. Plugging this int o Theorem 4.10 gives the result. Above, we use the Hessian bound  ∇2 ln pt(x)  ≤R2 σ4 t given in Lemma 4.13. Under the stronger smooth- ness assumption given by Assumption 3, we can take the step si zes to be larger. 14Corollary 4.12. Suppose that Assumptions 5, 2, 3 hold, C ≥R2 ≥d, g≡1, and that ˜P0 is such that the KL inequality (30) holds. Let δ= T−tN. If 0 <δ,ep< 1 2 and ε< 1/ √ T, hk = O ( ε max{T−tk,(T−tk)−1}C2dln(T δ ) ln ( R δεK ) ) , then for any 0 ≤k≤N, χ2(qtk||ptk) ≤eεχ2(q0||p0) + ε+ eε ∫ tk 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt. Proof. W e instead have the bound Lt = C σ2 t . The requirement (22) stays the same, while (23) is implied b y ε′ hk = O(1/C ). Inequality (24), for T −tk ≤1, is implied by ε′ hk = O       √ 1 dmax{C,R 2}ln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )   . and for T −tk >1, ε′ hk = O   √ ε Tdmax{C,R 2}ln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )  . Finally , the last requirement is implied by ε′ hk = O   ε Cdln (T δ ) ln ( R δεK )  , and for C ≥R2, ε≤1/ √ T, implies all the others. 4.1 Auxiliary bounds In this section we give bounds on the Hessian ( Lt, Lemma 4.13), initial χ2 divergence χ2(q0||p0) (Lemma 4.14), and Orlicz norm ( Mt, Lemma 4.15). Lemma 4.13 (Hessian bound) . Suppose that µ is a probability measure supported on a bounded set M⊂ Rd with radius R. Then letting ϕσ2 denote the density of N(0,σ 2Id),  ∇2 ln(µ∗ϕσ2 (x))  ≤max { R2 σ4 , 1 σ2 } . (25) Therefore, for ˜P0 supported on BR(0), R≥1, we have  ∇2 ln ˜pt(x)  ≤R2 σ4 t . (26) Proof. Let µx,σ2 denote the density µ(du) weighted with the gaussian ϕσ2 (u−x), that is, µx,σ2 (du) = e − ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) ∫ Rd e − ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) . W e note the following calculations: ∇ln(µ∗ϕσ2 (x)) = ∇ ∫ Rd e− ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) ∫ Rd e− ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) = ∫ Rd −x−u σ2 e− ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) ∫ Rd e− ∥ x−u∥ 2 2σ2 µ(du) = −1 σ2 Eµx,σ 2 (x−u) (27) ∇2 ln(µ∗ϕσ2 (x)) = 1 σ4 Covµx,σ 2 (x−u) − 1 σ2 Id = 1 σ4 Covµx,σ 2 (x) − 1 σ2 Id. (28) 15The covariance of a distribution supported on a set of radius R is bounded by R2 in operator norm. Inequality (25) then follows from (28). F or (26), note that ˜pt = Mmt♯˜P0 ∗ϕσ2 t , where mt is given by (3) and Mm denotes multiplication by m. Since Mmt♯˜P0 is supported on BmtR(0) ⊂BR(0) and σt ≤1, the result follows. Lemma 4.14 (Bound on initial χ2-divergence). Suppose that ˜P0 is supported on BR(0). Let pprior = N(0, (1 −eG0,t )Id). Then χ2(pprior||˜pT) ≤exp [ R2 exp(−G0,T) 1 −exp(−G0,T) ] and for 0 <ε< 1 2 and G0,T ≥ln ( 4R2 ε2 ) ∨1, we have χ2(pprior||˜pT) ≤ε2. Proof. W e have for x0 ∼˜P0 that χ2 ( N(0, (1 −e−G0,T )Id)||N(x0 exp ( −1 2G0,T ) , (1 −exp(−G0,T))Id) ) ≤exp [ ∥x0∥2 exp(−G0,T) 1 −exp(−G0,T) ] ≤exp (R2 exp(−G0,T) 1 −exp(−G0,T) ) Using convexity of χ2-divergence then gives the result. F or G0,T ≥ln ( 4R2 ε2 ) ∨1, we have exp [ R2 exp(−G0,T) 1 −exp(−G0,T) ] ≤exp [ ε2/ 4 1/ 2 ] ≤ε2. Lemma 4.15 (Subgaussian bound) . Suppose ˜P0 is supported on BR(0). Then for X ∼˜pt, ∥X∥2,ψ2 ≤ √ e ln 2 · ( 4mtR+ 6C1σt √ d ) = O(max{R, √ d}), where mt,σ t are as in (3) and C1 is an absolute constant. Proof. Let Y ∼ ˜P0 s.t. X = mtY + σtξ for some ξ ∼N(0,I d) independent of Y. Deﬁne U = ∥X∥2 :=(∑ d i=1 X2 i )1/2 , then for p≥1, E|U|p = E ∥X∥p 2 ≤E (∥mtY∥2 + ∥σtξ∥2)p ≤2p−1E [∥mtY∥p 2 + ∥σtξ∥p 2] ≤2p−1 [ (mtR)p + σp t ·2p/2 Γ((d+ p)/ 2) Γ(d/ 2) ] ≤2p−1 [ (mtR)p + C1( √ 2σt)p · ( dp/2 + pp/2 )] where Γ is the commonly used gamma function and C1 is an absolute constant. Therefore (E|U|p)1/p ≤2mtR+ √ 2C1σt( √ d+ √p) ≤K√p, where K = 2 mtR+ 3 C1σt √ d. Now consider V = U/K , then for some λ > 0 small enough, by T aylor expansion, E [ eλ2V2 ] = E [ 1 + ∞∑ p=1 ( λ2V2)p p! ] = 1 + ∞∑ p=1 λ2pE [ V2p] p! . 16Note that E [ V2p] ≤(2p)p, while Stirling’s approximation yields p! ≥(p/e )p. Substituting these two bounds, we get Eeλ2V2 ≤1 + ∞∑ p=1 (2λ2p p/e ) = ∞∑ p=0 (2eλ2)p = 1 1 −2eλ2 , provided that 2eλ2 <1, in which case the geometric series above converges. T o boun d this quantity further, we can use the numeric inequality 1/ (1 −x) ≤e2x which is valid for x∈[0, 1/ 2]. It follows that Eeλ2V2 ≤e4eλ2 for all λ satisfying |λ|≤ 1/ 2√e. Now set 4eλ2 = ln 2 , then E [ e ln 2 4eK2 ∥X∥2 2 ] ≤2, which implies that ∥X∥2,ψ2 ≤ √ 4e ln 2 K = √ e ln 2 · ( 4mtR+ 6C1σt √ d ) . 5 Bounding the KL divergence In this section, we bound the quantity K = KL( ψtqt||pt), where ψt is as in (8). While pt is deﬁned by the DDPM process, in this section we do not assume qt is the density of the discretized process; rather, it is any density for which Ept ( qt pt ) and χ2(qt||pt) are ﬁnite. Lemma 5.1. Suppose that ˜P0 is a probability measure on Rd such that ˜P0 = m∑ j=1 wj ˜Pj,0, (29) where wj > 0, ∑ m j=1 wj = 1 , and each ˜Pj,0 is a probability measure. For t >0, let ˜pt and ˜pj,t be the densities obtained by running the forward DDPM process (1) for time t, and pt = ˜pT−t, pj,t = ˜pj,T−t. Let wmin = min 1≤j≤mwj and suppose all the ˜Pj,t satisfy a log-Sobolev constant with constant Ct. Then for any qt, where ψt is as in (8) KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ 2CT−t χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + ln ( 1 wmin ) . While we need pt to satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality to get a bound of the form C χ2(qt||pt)+1 Ept ( qt pt ) ([LL T22, Lemma C.8]), we note that if we allow additive slack , it suﬃces for pt to be a mixture of distributions satisfying a log-Sobolev inequality , with the logarithm of the minimum mixture weight bounded below. In Lemma 5.2 we will see that we can almost decompose any distrib ution of bounded support in this manner, if we move a small amount of the mass. Proof. Let ft : [ m] →R be the function ft(j) = ∫ Rd ψt(x)qt(x) pt(x) Pj,t(x) dx. 17By decomposition of entropy and the fact that each Pi,t satisﬁes LSI with constant CT−t, KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤Entpt (ψtqt pt ) = m∑ i=1 ∫ Rd wiEntPi,t (ψtqt pt ) + Entw(ft) ≤Ct 2 m∑ i=1 wiEPi,t ( ln ψtqt pt , ψtqt pt ) + Entw(ft) ≤Ct 2 Ept ( ln ψtqt pt , ψtqt pt ) + Entw(ft) = Ct 2 ∫ Rd    ∇ln ψt(x)qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)qt(x) dx+ Entw( ft) = 2 Ct ∫ Rd    ∇ln qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)qt(x) dx+ Entw( ft) = 2 Ct ∫ Rd    ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2 ψt(x)pt(x)2 qt(x) dx+ Entw(ft) = 2Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 · ∫    ∇qt(x) pt(x)     2 pt(x) dx+ Entw( ft) ≤ 2Ct χ2(qt||pt) + 1 ·Ept (qt pt ) + ln ( 1 wmin ) , where the last inequality follows from noting wjft(j) is a probability mass function on [m], so that ft(j) ≤ 1 wj and Entw(ft) = m∑ j=1 wjft(j) ln(ft(j)) ≤ m∑ j=1 wjft(j) ln ( 1 wmin ) = ln ( 1 wmin ) . Lemma 5.2. Suppose 0 < εK < 1 2 , and that P0 is a probability measure such that P0(M) ≥1 −εK 8 . Let N ( M, σt 2 ) denote the covering number of Mwith balls of radius σt. Given δ >0, there exists a distribution ˜P0 such that χ2( ˜P0||P0) ≤εK and considering the DDPM process started with ˜P0, for all 0 ≤t≤T −δ, KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ (6(1 + e)σ2 T−t χ2(qt||pt) + 1 Ept (qt pt ) + ln (N(M,σ δ/ 2) εK )) . In particular, for M= BR(0) in Rd, KL(ψtqt||pt) ≤ (6(1 + e)σ2 T−t χ2(qt||pt) + 1 Ept (qt pt ) + ln ( 1 εK ) + dln ( 1 + 4R σδ )) . (30) Proof. Partition Minto disjoint subsets Mj, 1 ≤j ≤N := N(M,σ δ/ 2) of diameter at most σδ, and decompose P0 = w∗P∗ + n∑ j=1 wj ˜Pj,0 where pj is supported on Mj and P∗ = P0(·|Mc). W e will zero out the coeﬃcients of all small components: let Z = ∑ j:wj≥ εK 8N wj and wj = { wj Z , j ∈[n], wj ≥εK 8N 0, otherwise, 18and deﬁne ˜P0 = n∑ j=1 wj ˜Pj,0. Note that Z ≥1 −εK 8 −∑ j:wj≤ εK 8N ≥1 −εK 4 . As probability distributions on [m] ∪{∗}, χ2(w||w) ≤ ( 1 1 −εK 4 )2 −1 ≤εK, and hence the same bound holds for χ2( ˜P0||P0). Note each Mmt♯˜Pj,0 is supported on a set of diameter mtσ ≤σ. By Theorem 1 of [CCN21], noting that χ2(N(µ2, Σ) ||N(µ1, Σ)) = exp [ (µ2 −µ1)⊤Σ −1(µ2 −µ1) ] ≤e when Σ = σ2I and ∥µ2 −µ1∥≤ σ, ˜Pj,t = ( Mmt♯˜Pj,0) ∗ϕσ2 satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality with constant 6(1 + e)σ2 t. The result then follows from Lemma 5.1. F or M= BR(0), we use the bound N(BR(0),σ δ/ 2) ≤( 1 + 4R σδ )d [V er18, Corollary 4.2.13]. In the next section, we show that we can move a small amount of m ass εwithout signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the score function. This is necessary , as our guarantees on t he score estimate are for the original distribution and not the perturbed one in Lemma 5.2. 6 The eﬀect of perturbing the data distribution on the score f unc- tion In this section we consider the eﬀect of perturbing the data d istribution on the score function. The key observation is that the score function can be interpreted as the solution to an inference problem, that of recovering the original data point from a noisy sample, with data distribution as the given prior distribution. W e show through a coupling argument that we can bound the diﬀe rence between the score functions in terms of the distance between the two data distributions. This wil l allow us to “massage” the data distribution in order to optimally bound KL(ψtqt||pt) in Section 5. 6.1 Perturbation under χ2 error and truncation W e ﬁrst give a general lemma on denoising error from a mismatc hed prior. Lemma 6.1 (Denoising error from mismatched prior) . Let ϕ be a probability density on Rd, and P0,x,P 1,x be measures on Rd. For i = 0 , 1, let Pi denote the joint distribution of xi ∼Pi,x and yi = xi + ξi where ξi ∼ϕ, and let Pi,y denote the marginal distribution of y. Let m(k)(ε) : = sup 0≤f≤1, ∫ Rd fϕdx≤ε ∫ Rd f(x) ∥x∥kϕ(x) dx. Let εTV = TV( P0,x,P 1,x) and ε2 χ = χ2(P0,x||P1,x). Then ∫ Rd P0,y(dy0)     ∫ Rd x0P0(dx0|y0) − ∫ Rd x1P1(dx1|y0)     2 ≤8m(2)(εTV) + εχ √ m(4)(εTV) For ϕ = ϕσ2 , the upper bound is O ( σ2εχ ( d+ ln ( 1 εTV ))) . 19Note the tricky part of the proof is to deal with P1(dx1|y0), which can be thought of as inferring x assuming the incorrect prior P1,x, rather than the actual prior P0,x. Proof. F or notational clarity , we will denote draws from the condit ional distribution as ˆx0 and ˆx1, for example P0(dˆx0|y0). Let ri(y) = ∫ Rd(ˆxi −y)Pi(dˆxi|y). Let P0,1 be a coupling of (x0,y 0 = x0 + ξ0,x 1,y 1 = y1 + ξ1) such that x0 = x1 with probability 1 −εTV and ξ0 = ξ1 with probability 1. W e have ∫ Rd P0,y(dy0) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y0)∥2 = ∫ {y0=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y0)∥2    (I) + ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y0)∥2    (II) . Deﬁne a measure Q (not necessarily a probability measure) on Rd by Q(A) := P0,1(y0 ∈A and y0 = y1). Note that Q(A) ≤min{P0,y(A),P 1,y(A)}, so Q is absolutely continuous with respect to P0,y and P1,y, and by assumption on the coupling, Q(Rd) ≥1 −εTV. (31) Under P0,1, when y0 = y1, we can couple P0(dˆx0|y0) and P1(dˆx1|y0) so that x0 = x1 with probability min { dQ dP0,y , dQ dP1,y } . Let ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0) denote this coupled distribution. Then as in Lemma 6.5, (I) ≤ ∫ {y0=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1)      ∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} ((ˆx0 −y0) −(ˆx1 −y0)) ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0)      2 ≤2 ∫ Rd P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) (∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} ∥ξ0∥2 ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0) + ∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} ∥ξ1∥2 ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y1) ) W e bound this by ﬁrst bounding ∫ Rd P0,1,y(dy1,dy 2) ˆP(ˆx0 ̸= ˆx1) ≤ ∫ Rd P0,y(dy) max { 1 − dQ dP0,y , 1 − dQ dP1,y } ≤2εTV, (32) which follows from the two inequalities (using (31)) ∫ Rd P0,y(dy) ( 1 − dQ dP0,y ) = 1 −Q(Rd) ≤εTV ∫ Rd P0,y(dy) ( 1 − dQ dP1,y ) ≤ ∫ Rd P1,y(dy) ( 1 − dQ dP1,y ) + TV(P0,y,P 1,y) ≤(1 −Q(Rd)) + εTV ≤2εTV. F rom (32), and the fact that the distribution of (xi,y i) is the same as (ˆxi,y i) by Nishimori’s identity , we obtain (I) ≤2(m(2)(2εTV) + m(2)(2εTV)) = 4 m(2)(εTV). 20Now for the second term (II), (II) ≤2 ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1)(∥r0(y0)∥2 + ∥r1(y0)∥2). The ﬁrst term satisﬁes ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0)∥2 ≤m(2)(εTV). F or the second term, we note that Cauchy-Schwarz gives for any measures P and Q that ∫ Ω f(x)P(dx) ≤ ∫ Ω f(x)Q(dx) + ∫ Ω (dP dQ −1 ) f(x)Q(dx) ≤ ∫ Ω f(x)Q(dx) + √ χ2(P||Q) ∫ Ω f(x)2Q(dx) to switch from the measure P0,y to P1,y: ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0) ∥r1(y0)∥2 = ∫ Rn P0,y(dy0)P0,1,y(y0 ̸= y1|y0) ∥r1(y0)∥2 ≤ ∫ Rn P1,y(dy0)P0,1,y(y0 ̸= y1|y0) ∥r1(y0)∥2 + √ χ2(P0,y||P1,y) ∫ P1,y(dy0)P0,1,y(y0 ̸= y1|y0) ∥r1(y0)∥4 (Note that intentionally , the measure is P1,y, though we use y0 for the variable.) Hence, ∫ Rn P1,y(dy0)P0,1,y(y0 ̸= y1|y0) ≤TV(P0,y,P 1,y) + ∫ Rn P0,y(dy0)P0,1,y(y0 ̸= y1|y0) ≤2εTV so ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0) ∥r1(y0)∥2 ≤m(2)(2εTV) + √ χ2(P0,x||P1,x)m(4)(2εTV), where we used the data processing inequality . F or ϕ = ϕσ2 , we obtain by Lemma 6.6 that the bound is O ( σ2(εTV + εχε1/2 TV ) ( d+ ln ( 1 εTV ))) = O ( σ2εχ ( d+ ln ( 1 εTV ))) . W e use this lemma to obtain a bound on the L2 score error under perturbation of the distribution, by interpreting the score as the solution to a de-noising probl em. Lemma 6.2 (L2 score error under perturbation) . Let ˜P(0) = ˜P(0) 0 and ˜P(1) = ˜P(1) 0 be two probability distributions on Rd such that χ2( ˜P(1)||˜P(0)) ≤ε2 χ ≤1. 1. For any σ> 0, ∫   ∇ln( ˜P(0) ∗ϕσ2 )(x) −∇ln( ˜P(1) ∗ϕσ2 )(x)    2 ( ˜P(1) ∗ ϕσ2 )(dx) = O   εχ ( d+ ln ( 1 εχ )) σ2  . 2. Let ˜p(i) t be the density resulting from running (1) starting from ˜P(i), and let σt be as in (3). Then for any t> 0, ∫   ∇ln ˜p(0) t (x) −∇ln ˜p(1) t (x)    2 ˜p(1) t (x) dx= O   εχ ( d+ ln ( 1 εχ )) σ2 t  . 21Proof. F or part 1, note by (27) that ∇ln( ˜P(i) ∗ϕσ2 )(y) = 1 σ2 E ˜P(i) y,σ 2 (x−y), where ˜P(i) y,σ2 is the “tilted\" probability distribution deﬁned by d˜P(i) y,σ2 d˜P(i) (x) ∝e− ∥ x−y∥ 2 2σ2 . By Bayes’s rule, this can be viewed as the conditional probab ility that x0 = xgiven xt = y, where x0 ∼˜P(i) and y= x0 + σξ, ξ∼N(0,I d). Hence this ﬁts in the framework of Lemma 6.1 and ∫   ∇ln( ˜P(0) ∗ϕσ2 )(y) −∇ln( ˜P(1) ∗ϕσ2 )(y)    2 ( ˜P(1) ∗ϕσ2 )(dy) = 1 σ4 ∫ Rd   E ˜P(0) y,t [x] −E ˜P(1) y,t [x]    2 ( ˜P(1) ∗ϕσ2 )(dy) = O (1 σ4 σ2εχ ( d+ ln ( 1 εTV ))) , giving the result. F or part 2, note that ˜p(i) t = ( Mmt♯˜P(i)) ∗ϕσ2 t . Applying part 1 with ˜P(i) ←/mapsfromcharMmt♯˜P(i) (which preserves χ2-divergence) and σ = σt gives the result. Finally , we argue that a score estimate that is accurate with respect to ˜p(1) t will still be accurate with re- spect to ˜p(0) t , with high probability . When using this lemma, we will subst itute in the bound from Lemma 6.2. Lemma 6.3. Let ˜P(0) 0 and ˜P(1) 0 be two probability distributions on Rd with TV distance ε. Suppose the estimated score function st(x) satisﬁes   ∇ln ˜p(0) t −st    2 L2(˜p(0) t ) = E˜p(0) t [   ∇ln ˜p(0) t (x) −st(x)    2] ≤ε2 t for t∈(0,T ], and ∇ln ˜p(0) t is Lt-Lipschitz. Then for t∈(0,T ] and any ε∞ >0, P˜p(1) t (  st −∇ln ˜p(1) t   ≥ε∞ ) ≤ε+ 4 ε2 ∞ · [ ε2 t + ∫   ∇ln ˜p(1) t (x) −∇ln ˜p(0) t (x)    2 ˜p(1) t (x) dx ] . Proof. W e have P˜p(1) t (  st −∇ln ˜p(1) t   ≥ε∞ ) ≤P˜p(1) t (  st −∇ln ˜p(0) t   ≥ε∞/ 2 ) + P˜p(1) t (  ∇ln ˜p(0) t −∇ln ˜p(1) t   ≥ε∞/ 2 ) ≤TV(˜p(0) t , ˜p(1) t ) + P˜p(0) t (  st −∇ln ˜p(0) t   ≥ε∞/ 2 ) + P˜p(1) t (  ∇ln ˜p(0) t −∇ln ˜p(1) t   ≥ε∞/ 2 ) . The ﬁrst term is bounded by TV( ˜P(0), ˜P(1)) ≤ε. F or the second term, by Chebyshev’s Inequality , P˜p(0) t (  st −∇ln ˜p(0) t   ≥ε1/ 2 ) ≤ 4 ε2 ∞ E˜p(0) t [   st −∇ln ˜p(0) t    2] ≤4ε2 t ε2 ∞ ; F or the last term, again by Chebyshev’s Inequality , P˜p(1) t (  ∇ln ˜p(0) t −∇ln ˜p(1) t   ≥ε∞/ 2 ) ≤ 4 ε2 1 ∫   ∇ln ˜p(1) t (x) −∇ln ˜p(0) t (x)    2 ˜p(1) t (x)dx. W e conclude the proof by combining the these three inequalit ies. 22Finally , we will need the following to obtain a TV error bound to ˜p0 in Theorem 2.3. Lemma 6.4. Suppose that ˜p0 ∝e−V(x) is a probability density on Rd with bounded ﬁrst moment E˜p0 ∥X∥, and V is L-smooth. Then for t> 0 such that αtσt ≤ 1 2L, we have TV(˜pt, ˜p0) ≤2 (αt −1) ·(LE˜p0 ∥X∥+ d) + 3 2 dLαtσt. Here αt = 1 /m t and σt are deﬁned in (3). In particular, TV (˜pδ, ˜p0) ≤εTV if δ = O( ε2 TV R2L2 ) and R = max {√ d, E˜p0 ∥X∥ } . Proof. Without loss of generality , we assume that ˜p0(x) = e−V(x). Note that ˜pt(x) = ∫ αd t˜p0(αty)ϕσ2 t (x− y) dy. Let ˜qt(x) := αd t˜p0(αtx), which is also a probability density on Rd. Then by the triangle inequality , TV(˜pt, ˜p0) ≤TV(˜pt, ˜qt) + TV( ˜qt, ˜p0). F or the second term, |˜qt(x) −˜p0(x)|= ⏐ ⏐αd t˜p0(αtx) −˜p0(x) ⏐ ⏐ = ⏐ ⏐ ⏐e−V(αtx)+dln αt −e−V(x) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ≤max { e−V(x),e −V(αtx)+dln αt } · ( 1 −e−|V(x)−V(αtx)+dln αt| ) ≤(˜p0(x) + ˜qt(x)) ·(|V(x) −V(αtx)|+ dln αt) ≤(˜p0(x) + ˜qt(x)) ·[L∥x∥(αt −1) + dln αt] , where in the second inequality , we use the fact that 1 −ex ≤|x|for all x≤0. Thus TV(˜qt(x), ˜p0(x)) = 1 2 ∫ |˜qt(x) −˜p0(x)|dx ≤ ∫ [L(αt −1) ∥x∥+ dln αt] ˜p0(x) dx+ ∫ [L(αt −1) ∥x∥+ dln αt] ˜qt(x) dx ≤L(αt −1) (∫ ∥x∥˜p0(x)dx+ ∫ ∥x∥˜qt(x)dx ) + 2dln αt ≤2L(αt −1) ∫ ∥x∥˜p0(x)dx+ 2dln αt. Now for the ﬁrst term, ˜pt(x) −˜qt(x) = ∫ ˜qt(x−y)ϕσ2 t (y) dy−˜qt(x) = ∫ (˜qt(x−σty) −˜qt(x)) ϕ(y)dy, where ϕ(y) is the density of the d-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution. Apply Minko wski’s inequality for integrals: ∫ |˜pt(x) −˜qt(x)|dx= ∫ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ∫ (˜qt(x−σty) −˜qt(x)) ϕ(y)dy ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐dx ≤ ∫ [ ∫ |˜qt(x−σty) −˜qt(x)|dx ] ϕ(y) dy ≤ ∫ [ ∫ ( eL∥αtσty∥ −1 ) ˜qt(x)dx ] ϕ(y) dy = ∫ ( eL∥αtσty∥ −1 ) ϕ(y) dy 23= (2 π)−d/2 ∫ eLαtσt∥y∥− ∥ y∥ 2 2 dy−1 ≤(2π)−d/2 ∫ e[− 1 2 +(Lαtσt)2]∥y∥2 dy+ Lαtσt ∫ ∥y∥ϕ(y) dy−1 ≤ [ 1 1 −2 (Lαtσt)2 ] d/2 + √ dLαtσt −1 ≤e2d(Lαtσt)2 −1 + √ dLαtσt ≤4d(Lαtσt)2 + √ dLαtσt, where in the third inequality , we use the elementary inequal ity ex ≤x+ ex2 , which is valid for all x ∈R, and in the ﬁfth inequality , we use 1 1−2x ≤e4x, which holds for x∈[0, 1/ 3]. Hence if Lαtσt ≤1/ 2, we have TV(˜pt, ˜qt) ≤1 2 ∫ |˜pt(x) −˜qt(x)|dx≤3 2dLαtσt. Now we conclude the proof by combining the bounds for TV(˜pt, ˜qt) and TV(˜p0, ˜qt): TV(˜pt, ˜p0) ≤TV(˜pt, ˜qt) + TV( ˜qt, ˜p0) ≤2L(αt −1) ∫ ∥x∥˜p0(x)dx+ 2dln αt + 3 2 dLαtσt ≤2 (αt −1) ·(LE˜p0 ∥X∥+ d) + 3 2dLαtσt, where we use the fact that ln x≤x−1 for all x≥1. Recall that αt = 1 /m t = et/2 and σ2 t = 1 −e−t when g≡1. It suﬃces for max { 2 (LE˜p0 ∥X∥+ d) (αδ −1) , 3 2 dLαδσδ } ≤εTV 2 , which is implied by δ≼ min { εTV LE˜p0 ∥X∥+ d, ε2 TV d2L2 } ≍ ε2 TV R2L2 , for appropriate constants, as R≥max {√ d, E˜p0 ∥X∥ } . 6.2 Perturbation under TV error Although we will not need it in our proof, we note that we can de rive a similar perturbation result under TV error, which might be of independent interest. Lemma 6.5. Let K(x,dy ) be a probability kernel on Rd, let P0,x,P 1,x be measures on Rd. Let Pi denote the joint distribution of xi ∼Pi,x and yi ∼K(xi, ·), and let Pi,y denote the marginal distribution of y. Suppose there is a coupling P0,1 of (x0,y 0) ∼P0 and (x1,y 1) ∼P1 such that • x0 = x1 with probability 1 −ε, • x0 = x1 implies y0 = y1, and • E[∥y0 −y1∥2] ≤ε2 W. 24Deﬁne the tail error by mi(ε) : = sup 0≤f≤1, ∫ Rd fϕdx≤ε ∫ Rd f(x) ∥x∥2 Pi( dx). Let ri(y) = ∫ Rd xiPi(dxi|y), and suppose that r1(y) = ∫ Rd x1P1(dx1|y) is L1-Lipschitz. Then ∫ Rd P0,y(dy0)     ∫ Rd x0P0(dx0|y0) − ∫ Rd x1P1(dx1|y0)     2 ≤4(m0(2ε) + m0(ε) + m1(2ε) + m1(ε)) + 2 L2 1ε2 W ≤4(m0(2ε) + m1(2ε)) + 4(1 + L2 1)(m0(ε) + m1(ε)). Proof. F or notational clarity , we will denote draws from the condit ional distribution as ˆx0 and ˆx1, for example P0(dˆx0|y0). W e have ∫ Rd P0,y(dy0) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y0)∥2 ≤2 ∫ Rd×Rd P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y1)∥2    (I) + 2 ∫ Rd×Rd P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r1(y1) −r1(y0)∥2    (II) . F or the ﬁrst term (I), we split it as (I) ≤ ∫ {y0=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y0)∥2    (i) + ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) ∥r0(y0) −r1(y1)∥2    (ii) . Deﬁne the measure Q on Rd by Q(A) : = P0,1(y0 ∈Aand y0 = y1). As in Lemma 6.2, under P0,1, when y0 = y1, we can couple P0(dˆx0|y0) and P1(dˆx1|y0) so that x0 = x1 with probability min { dQ dP0,y , dQ dP1,y } . Let ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0) denote this coupled distribution. Then (i) ≤ ∫ {y0=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1)      ∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} (ˆx0 −ˆx1) ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0)      2 ≤2 ∫ Rd P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1) (∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} ∥ˆx0∥2 ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y0) + ∫ {ˆx0̸=ˆx1} ∥ˆx1∥2 ˆP(dˆx0,d ˆx1|y1) ) ≤2(m0(2ε) + m1(2ε)) as in Lemma 6.2. Now (ii) ≤2 ∫ {y0̸=y1} P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1)(∥r0(y0)∥2 + ∥r1(y1)∥2) ≤2(m0(ε) + m1(ε)). Finally , for the second term (II), we use the fact that r1 is L1 Lipschitz and the coupling to conclude (II) ≤ ∫ Rd P0,1,y(dy0,dy 1)L2 1 ∥y0 −y1∥2 ≤L2 1ε2 W. W e conclude the proof by combining the inequalities for (i), (ii), and (II). F or the second upper bound, we note that E[∥y0 −y1∥2] ≤2(E[∥y0∥2] + E[∥y1∥2]) ≤2(m0(ε) + m1(ε)). 256.3 Gaussian tail calculation W e use the following Gaussian tail calculation in the proof o f Lemma 6.2. Lemma 6.6. Let µ be the standard Gaussian measure on N(0,I d). Then sup µ(A)≤ε ∫ A ∥x∥2 µ(dx) ≤ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε ) + 3 ) = O ( ε ( d+ ln (1 ε ))) sup µ(A)≤ε ∫ A ∥x∥4 µ(dx) ≤ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε ))2 + 3ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε )) + 9ε= O ( ε ( d2 + ln (1 ε )2)) . Proof. By the χ2 tail bound in [LM00], for t≥0, µ(∥X∥2 ≥2d+ 3t) ≤P(∥X∥2 ≥d+ 2 √ dt+ 2t) ≤e−t, (33) so ∥X∥2 is stochastically dominated by a random variable with cdf F(y) = 1 −e− y−2d 3 . Then letting PY be the measure corresponding to F, sup µ(A)≤ε ∫ A ∥x∥2 µ(dx) ≤ sup PY(A)≤ε ∫ A yPY(dy) = ∫ ∞ 2d+3 ln(1 ε) ydF(y) = ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε )) + ∫ ∞ 2d+3 ln( 1 ε) e− y−2d 3 dy= ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε )) + 3ε and sup µ(A)≤ε ∫ A ∥x∥4 µ(dx) ≤ sup PY(A)≤ε ∫ A y2PY(dy) = ∫ ∞ 2d+3 ln(1 ε) y2dF(y) = ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε ))2 + ∫ ∞ 2d+3 ln(1 ε) 2ye− y−2d 3 dy = ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε ))2 − [ 3ye− y−2d 3 ] ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ∞ 2d+3 ln(1 ε) + ∫ ∞ 2d+3 ln(1 ε) 3e− y−2d 3 dy = ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε ))2 + 3ε ( 2d+ 3 ln (1 ε )) + 9ε. 7 Guarantees under L2-accurate score estimate W e will state our results under a more general tail bound assu mption. Assumption 6 (T ail bound) . R: [0 , 1] →[0, ∞) is a function such that Pdata(BR(ε)(0)) ≥1 −ε. Our result will require R(ε) to grow at most as a suﬃciently small power of ε−1 as ε→0; in particular, this holds for subexponential distributions. By taking Rto be a constant function, this contains the assumption of bounded support (Assumption 2) as a special case. 7.1 TV error guarantees W e follow the framework of [LL T22] to convert guarantees und er L∞-accurate score estimate, to guarantees under L2-accurate score estimate. Theorem 7.1 ([LL T22, Theorem 4.1]) . Let (Ω , F, P) be a probability space and {Fn}be a ﬁltration of the sigma ﬁeld F. Suppose Xn ∼pn, Zn ∼qn, and Zn ∼qn are Fn-adapted random processes taking values in Ω , and Bn ⊆Ω are sets such that the following hold for every n∈N0. 261. If Zk ∈Bc k for all 0 ≤k≤n−1, then Zn = Zn. 2. χ2(qn||pn) ≤D2 n. 3. P(Xn ∈Bn) ≤δn. Then the following hold. TV(qn, qn) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k TV(pn,q n) ≤Dn + n−1∑ k=0 (D2 k + 1)1/2δ1/2 k (34) Theorem 7.2 (DDPM with L2-accurate score estimate) . Let 0 <εχ,ε TV,δ < 1 2 . Suppose that Assumption 6 for a suﬃciently small value of c that R0 is such that R (cε3 TVδ6ε12 χ R19 0 d5 ) ≤R0, and R2 0 ≥d. Suppose one of the following cases holds. 1. Let Pdata,s (·,t ) be such that Assumption 1 holds, with R2 0 ≥d. Suppose that εσ = O ( εTVδ5/2ε11/2 χB9/4 ) , where B = R4 0dln (T δ ) ln ( R0d δεTV εχ ) , and we run (5) starting from pprior for time T = ln ( 16R2 0 ε2 χ ) , N = O ( B(T+ 1 δ2 ) ε2 χ ) steps with step sizes satisfying hk = O ( ε2 χ Bmax{T−tk,(T−tk)−3} ) . 2. Let Pdata,s (·,t ) be such that Assumptions 1 and 3 hold, with C ≥R2 0. Suppose εσ = O ( εTVε3 χ T5/2B ) , where B = C2dln (T δ ) ln ( R0d δεTV εχ ) , and we run (5) starting from pprior for time T = ln ( 16R2 0 ε2 χ ) , N = O ( B(T+ln(1 δ)) ε2 χ ) steps with step sizes satisfying hk = O ( ε2 χ Bmax{T−tk,(T−tk)−1} ) . Then the resulting distribution qtN is such that qtN is εTV-far in TV distance from a distribution qtN, where qtN satisﬁes χ2(qtN||ptN) ≤ε2 χ. In particular, taking εχ = εTV, we have TV(qT,P data) ≤2εTV. Note that the condition on R can be satisﬁed if R(ε) = o(R−1/19) (no eﬀort has been made to optimize the exponent). Proof. W e invoke Lemma 5.2 for a εK to be chosen, to obtain a distribution ˜P0 on BR0 (0), where R0 ≥ R(εK/ 8). Let B = R4 0dln (T δ ) ln ( R0 δεK ) and B = C2dln (T δ ) ln ( R0 δεK ) in case 1 and case 2, respectively; our choice of εK = O ( ε2 TV δ6 n2R6 0 ) will give the deﬁnition of B in the theorem statement. In the following, we deﬁne ˜pt with ˜P0, rather than Pdata, as the initial distribution. Note that since TV(Pdata, ˜P0) ≤√ εK = o(εTV) (and the same holds for their evolutions under (1)), it suﬃce s to consider convergence to ˜pδ. W e ﬁrst deﬁne the bad sets where the error in the score estimat e is large, Bt : = {∥∇ln ˜pt(x) −s(x,t )∥>ε∞,t} (35) for some ε∞,t to be chosen. 27Given t ≥0, let t− = tk where k is such that t ∈[tk,t k+1). Given bad sets Bt, deﬁne the interpolated process on [tk,t k+1) by dzt = g(T −t)2 (1 2 zt + b(z−,T −t−) ) dt+ g(T −t) dwt (36) where b(z,t ) = { s(z,t ), z ̸∈Bt ∇ln ˜pt(z), z ∈Bt . In other words, simulate the reverse SDE using the score esti mate as long as the point is in the good set at the previous discretization timepoint tk, and otherwise use the actual gradient ∇ln pt. Let qt denote the distribution of zt when z0 ∼q0. Note that this process is deﬁned only for purposes of analys is, as we do not have access to ∇ln pt. As before, we let denote qt the distribution of zt deﬁned by (12). W e can couple this process with the exponential integrator ( 5) using s so that as long as xtm ̸∈BT−tm, the processes agree, thus satisfying condition 1 of Theorem 7.1. Then by Lemma 6.3, ˜P(0) t (Bt) = εK + 4 ε2 ∞,t  ε2 t + O   εK ( d+ ln ( 1 εK )) σ2 t    , Then by choice of hk and either Corollary 4.11 or 4.12, when ∫tn 0 ε2 t dt= O(1), χ2( qtk||ptk) = eεχ2(q0||p0) + ε+ eε ∫ tn 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt (37) ≤2χ2(q0||p0) + O(1), where ε = ε2 χ 4 . F or χ2(qtk||ptk) to be bounded by ε2 χ, it suﬃces for the terms in (37) to be bounded by ε2 χ 2 , ε2 χ 4 , ε2 χ 4 ; this is implied by T = ln (16R2 ε2 χ ) by Lemma 4.14 ∫ tn 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt= O(ε2 χ). (38) By Theorem 7.1, TV(qtn, qtn) ≤ n−1∑ k=0 (1 + χ2(qtk||ptk))1/2P(Btk)1/2 ≤ n−1∑ k=0 ( 2χ2(q0||p0)1/2 + O(1) ) δ1/2 t (39) = O (n−1∑ k=0 εtk ε∞,tk + √εK ( 1 + √ d+ ln(1/ε K) ε∞,tkσT−tk )) . (40) F or this to be bounded by εTV, it suﬃces for n−1∑ k=0 εt ε∞,t = O(εTV) (41) εK = O ( minkε2 tkσ2 T−tk d+ ln(1/ε K) ) . (42) 28W e bound (42) crudely , as the dependence on εK will be logarithmic. Using ε2 tk = ε2 σ/σ 4 tk, it suﬃces that εK = O ( ε2 σ d+ ln(1/ε K) ) . (43) W e will return to this after deriving a condition on εσ. It remains to bound (38) and (41). W e break up the timepoints depending on whether T −t> 1. Let (t0,t 1,...,t N) = ( t0,...,t ncoarse−1,t ′ 0,...,t ′ nﬁne ) and uk = T −t′ k, where tncoarse−1 ≤T −1 ≤t′ 1. Let h′ k = t′ k+1 −t′ k. Note the “ﬁne” timepoints will be closer together than the “coarse” timepoints. W e break up th e integral (38) and the sum (41) into the parts involving the coarse and ﬁne timepoints. F or (38), it suﬃces to have (38), coarse: ∫ t′ 0 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt≤T max 0≤k≤ncoarse ε2 ∞,T−tk = O(ε2 χ) so it suﬃces to take ε2 ∞,T−tk ≍ ε2 χ T . Let α = 3 in case 1 and α = 1 in case 2. F or the ﬁne part, recalling our choice of h′ k, it suﬃces to have (note we can redeﬁne εt = εtk when t∈[tk,t k+1) without any harm) (38), ﬁne: ∫ t′ nﬁne t′ 0 ε2 ∞,T−tdt= nﬁne −1∑ k=0 h′ kε2 ∞,T−t′ k = O(ε2 χ) ⇐= nﬁne −1∑ k=0 ε2 χuα k B ε2 ∞,uk = O(ε2 χ) ⇐= nﬁne −1∑ k=0 uα kε2 ∞,uk B = O(1). (44) F or (41), it suﬃces to have (41), coarse: ncoarse−1∑ k=0 εT−tk ε∞,T−tk ≍ncoarse εσ εχ/ √ T = O(εTV) ⇐= εσ = O ( εTVεχ ncoarse√ T ) (45) and (41), ﬁne: nﬁne −1∑ k=0 εuk ε∞,uk ≍ nﬁne −1∑ k=0 εσ ukε∞,uk = O(εTV). (46) Note that in light of the required step sizes, we can take ncoarse ≍T2B ε2 χ . Considering the equality case of Hölder’s inequality on (44) 1/3(46)2/3 suggests that we take εσ ≍ εTVB1/2(∑ nﬁne −1 k=0 uk α−2 3 )3/2 (47) ε∞,uk ≍ B1/2 uk α+1 3 (∑ nﬁne −1 k=0 uk α−2 3 )1/2 (48) 29Note that the number of steps needed in the ﬁne part is O ( B ε2 χ δ2 ) in the ﬁrst case and O ( B ε2 χ ) ln (1 δ ) in the second case. W e can check that (47) and (48) make (44) and (46) satisﬁed. Finally , we calculate the denominator for εσ. In case 1, note that starting from T−t′ 0 = O(1) and taking steps of size h′ k ≍ ε2 χ B(T−t′ k)3 , it takes nﬁne = Θ ( B ε2 χδ2 ) steps to reach T −t= δ. uk = T −t′ k = ( 1 + Θ ( kε2 χ B ))− 1 2 nﬁne −1∑ k=0 u1/3 k ≍ nﬁne −1∑ k=0 ( 1 + Θ ( kε2 χ B ))− 1 6 ≍B ε2 χ (nﬁne ) 5 6 ≍ (B ε2 χ )11/6 1 δ5/3 . Then we obtain εσ ≍εTVB1/2 ε11/2 χ B11/4 δ5/2 = εTVδ5/2ε11/2 χ B9/4 . In case 1, our requirement is εσ ≍O ( εTVδ5/2ε11/2 χ B9/4 ∧εTVε3 χ T5/2B ) , but note that the ﬁrst bound is more stringent. Now, returnin g to (43), we see that it suﬃces to take εK = O ( 1 d ( εTV δ5/ 2ε11/ 2 χ R9 0d9/ 4 )2+β) for any β >0 (this will “solve” the log(1/ε K) appearing in B.) In case 2, we have instead uk = exp ( −Θ (ε2 χ Bk )) so εσ ≍εTVB1/2 ( ε2 χ B )3/2 = εTVε3 χ B . Theorem 7.3 (TV error for DDPM with L2-accurate score estimate and smoothness) . Let 0 < εTV < 1 2 . Suppose that Assumption 4 and 6 for a suﬃciently small value o f c that R0 is such that R ( cε15 TV R31 0 d5L12 ) ≤R0, and R2 0 ≥max { d, EPdata [ ∥X∥2 ]} , and one of the following cases holds. 1. Let Pdata,s (·,t ) be such that Assumption 1 holds. Suppose that εσ = O ( ε11.5 TV B9/4R5 0L5 ) , where B = R4 0dln ( TR2 0L2 ε2 TV ) ln ( R3 0dL2 ε3 TVεχ ) , and we run (5) starting from pprior for time T = ln ( 16R2 0 ε2 TV ) , N = O   B ( T+ ( R0L εTV ) 4 ) ε2 TV  steps with step sizes satisfying hk = O ( ε2 χ Bmax{T−tk,(T−tk)−3} ) . 2. Let Pdata,s (·,t ) be such that Assumptions 1 and 3 hold, with C ≥R2 0. Suppose εσ = O ( ε4 TV T5/2B ) , where B = C2dln ( TR2 0L2 ε2 TV ) ln ( R3 0dL2 ε4 TV ) , and we run (5) starting from pprior for time T = ln ( 16R2 0 ε2 TV ) , N = O ( B ( T+ln ( R0L εTV )) ε2 TV ) steps with step sizes satisfying hk = O ( ε2 χ Bmax{T−tk,(T−tk)−1} ) . 30Then the resulting distribution qtN is such that qtN is εTV-far in TV distance from the data distribution Pdata. Proof. With the result of Theorem 7.2, we see that TV(qtN,p tN) ≤2εTV. Now by Lemma 6.4, if we further assume δ= O (ε2 TV R2 0L2 ) , then TV(ptN,P data) ≤εTV. W e conclude the proof by triangle inequality and replacing the δ-dependence with O( ε2 TV R2 0L2 ) in the previous theorem.Proof of Theorem 2.3. If Pdata is subexponential with a ﬁxed constant, note that Assumptio n 6 holds with R(ε) = O ( ln (1 ε )) and hence R0 is logarithmic in all parameters. 7.2 Wasserstein error guarantees Proof of Theorem 2.1. If T−tN = δ, then W2(˜p0, ˜pδ) ≤σδ ≤ √ δ. Choosing δ= ε2 W, we see by Theorem 7.2 it suﬃces to take εσ = O    ε13/2 TV (ε2 W)5/2 ( R4dln (T δ ) ln ( RN δεW ))9/4   . Simplifying gives εσ = ˜o ( ε6.5 TV ε5 W R9d2.25 ) . If Assumption 3 also holds, then it suﬃces to take εσ = O   ε4 TV T5/2C2dln (T δ ) ln ( RN δεW )  . Simplifying gives εσ = ˜o ( ε4 TV C2d ) . Proof of Theorem 2.2. T o obtain purely W asserstein error guarantees, we include a n extra step of replacing any sample ztN ∼qtN falling outside BR(0) by 0. Suppose T−tN = δ. Let ˆqtN be the resulting distribution. Then W2(˜p0, ˆqtN) ≤W2(˜p0, ˜pδ) + W2(˜pδ, ˆqtN) ≤σδ + W2(˜pδ, ˜qtN) ≤ √ δ+ W2(˜pδ, ˆqtN). W e choose δ= ε2 W 4 so the ﬁrst term is ≤εW 2 . It suﬃces to bound the second term W2(˜pδ, ˆqtN) also by εW 2 . W e bound it in terms of TV(˜pδ, ˆqtN) using the fact that ˆqtN is supported on BR(0) and using a Gaussian tail calculation for ˜pδ. Consider a coupling of xtN = ˜xδ ∼˜pδ and ˆztN ∼ˆqtN such that xδ ̸= ˆztN with probability εTV. Express ˜xδ = mδ˜x0 + σδξwhere ˜x0 ∼˜p0. Now E[∥˜xδ −ˆztN∥2] ≤ sup P(A)≤εTV 2 ( E[∥mδ˜x0 −ztN∥2 /BD A] + σ2 δE[∥ξ∥2 /BD A] ) = 2 ( 4R2εTV + σ2 δεTV ·O ( d+ ln ( 1 εTV ))) , where the bound on the second term uses Lemma 6.6. Using R2 ≥d, we see that it suﬃces to choose εTV = O ( ε2 W R2 ) for appropriate choice of constants. By Theorem 7.2, it suﬃc es to take εσ = O    (ε2 W/R 2)13/2 ( ε2 W )5/2 ( R4dln (T δ ) ln ( RN δεW ))9/4   . 31Simplifying gives ˜o ( ε18 W R22d2.25 ) . In case 2, it suﬃces to take εσ = O   (ε2 W/R 2)4 T5/2(C2dln (T δ ) ln ( RN δεW ) )  . Simplifying gives εσ = ˜o ( ε8 W C2R8d ) .

A High-probability bound on the Hessian In this section we obtain a high-probability bound on the Hes sian of ln ˜pt, i.e., the Jacobian of the score function. T o see why we expect Hessian to usually be smaller than the wor st-case bound given by Lemma 4.13, note that we can express (27) and (28) as ∇ln(µ ∗ϕσ2 (y)) = −1 σ2 E[Y −X|Y = y] (49) ∇2 ln(µ ∗ϕσ2 (y)) = 1 σ4 Cov[Y −X|Y = y] − 1 σ2 Id (50) where X ∼µ and Y = X + σξ, ξ ∼N(0,I d). W e expect that the random variable Y −X is distributed as N(0,σ 2Id), which suggests that the covariance (50) may be bounded by 1 σ2 rather than 1 σ with high probability . Indeed, we can easily construct an example whe re the worst case of Lemma 4.13 is attained—for example, µ = 1 2 (δ−v+ δv) for ∥v∥2 = R, at x= 0 —but this point has exponentially small probability density under µ ∗ϕσ2 . The following lemma uses a ε-net argument to bound the operator norm of the variance of a c onditional distribution, with high probability . Lemma A.1. Suppose X is a Rd-valued random variable over the probability space (Ω , G,P ), and F⊆G is a σ-subalgebra. If X is subgaussian, then P ( E [  XX⊤ |F ] ≥2 ∥X∥2 ψ2 ln (2 ·5d ε )) ≤ε. 33Proof. By Jensen’s inequality and Markov’s inequality , for any v∈Sd−1, P ( E[v⊤XX⊤v|F] ≥λ2) = P ( eE[v⊤XX⊤v|F]/c2 ≥eλ2/c2 ) ≤P ( E [ e⟨X,v⟩2/c2 |F ] ≥eλ2/c2 ) ≤ E [ E[e⟨X,v⟩2/c2 |F] ] eλ2/c2 = E [ e⟨X,v⟩2/c2 ] eλ2/c2 ≤2e−λ2/∥X∥ψ2 , where the last inequality follows from taking c= ∥X∥ψ2 . Now take a 1 2 -net N of Sd−1 of size ≤5d [V er18, Cor. 4.2.13]. By a union bound, P ( ∃v∈N : E[v⊤XX⊤v|F] ≥λ2) ≤5d ·2 ·e−λ2/∥X∥2 ψ2 = ε when we take λ = ∥X∥ψ2 √ ln ( 2·5d ε ) . By [V er18, Lemma 4.4.1], the operator norm can be bounded by the norm on an ε-net, ∥A∥≤ 2 sup v∈A ∥⟨A,v ⟩∥= 2 sup v∈A |v⊤Av|. where the second inequality holds when Ais symmetric. The result follows from applying this to E[v⊤XX⊤v|F]. F rom this we obtain the desired high-probability bound. Lemma A.2. There is a universal constant C such that the following holds. For any starting distribution ˜P0, letting ˜Pt be the law of the DDPM process (1) at time t, we have ˜Pt (  ∇2 ln ˜pt(x)  ≤C(d+ ln (1 ε ) ) σ2 t ) ≥1 −ε. Note that there is no dependence on the radius. Proof. Apply (50) with µ = Mmt♯˜P0 to obtain ∇2 ln ˜pt. Noting that Y −X ∼N(0,σ 2Id) is subgaussian with ∥Y −X∥ψ2 ≤C2σ for some universal constant C2, the result follows from Lemma A.1. 34",

(2015) in the context of thermodynamics modeling, diffusion models now play a pivotal role in modern generative modeling, a task that aims to generate new data instances that resemble the training data in distribution. Remarkably, diffusion models are capable of producing high- quality synthetic samples, and have claimed the state-of-the-art performance across various domains, ranging from image generation (Song and Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020a; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021; Nichol et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022; Ho and Salimans, 2022), text generation (Austin et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022), speech synthesis, (Popov et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2022), time series imputation (Tashiro et al., 2021; Alcaraz and Strodthoff, 2022), reinforcement learning (Pearce et al., 2023; Hansen-Estruch et al., 2023), and molecule modeling (Anand and Achim, 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Trippe et al.). Remarkably, diffusion models have served as crucial components of mainstream content generators including Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2022), and Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022), among others, achieving superior performance in the now rapidly growing field of generative artificial intelligence. We refer the interested reader to Yang et al. (2023) for a comprehensive survey of methods and applications pertinent to diffusion models, and to Tang and Zhao (2024); Chen et al. (2024a) for overviews of recent theoretical development. 1.1 Diffusion model overview On a high level, diffusion models take into consideration two processes: 1) a forward process X0 →X1 →···→ XK that sequentially diffuses the target data distribution into an easy-to-sample prior, typically chosen as a standard Gaussian distribution; 2) a learned reverse process Y0 →Y1 →···→ YK that transforms the prior (e.g., standard Gaussian) back into a distribution that resembles the target distribution, with the aim of achievingXk d ≈Yk for allk= 0,1,··· ,K. A key component that enables the construction of a faithful reverse process is the estimated (Stein) score functions (Song et al., 2020b), typically represented by pre-trained neural networks. During the sampling phase, only the reverse process is implemented to generate new data instances. Constructing the forward process is generally straightforward which often amounts to successively injecting noise into the data; in contrast, the reverse process is far more complicated, which generally involves evaluating large-scale denoising neural networks recursively (for the purpose of computing the estimated score functions) to restore the target distribution. Viewed in this light, the number of function evaluations (NFE)—more precisely, the number of times needed to compute the output of, say, denoising neural networks—oftentimes dictates the efficiency of diffusion-based samplers. There are at least two primary approaches concerned with the construction of the reverse processes: stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based samplers, and ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based samplers (Song et al., 2020b). These samplers are based on discrete-time processes that approximate the 2Figure1:Class-conditionalImageNet 64×64 samplesgeneratedusing250samplingstepswithourmethod(Algorithm1). dynamics of certain diffusion SDEs and ODEs, such that when initialized at the prior, the solutions of these differential equations are designed to have marginal distributions that match the target distribution. Prominent examples of SDE-based and ODE-based samplers include the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020) and the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) (Song et al., 2020a), respectively. Empirically, ODE-based samplers offer faster sampling speeds compared to the SDE-based counterpart, while SDE-based samplers often generates higher-quality samples given sufficient runtime (Song et al., 2020a; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021). The respective advantages of these two approaches motivate researchers to explore both types of samplers. 1.2 Accelerating diffusion models While mainstream diffusion-based samplers like DDPM are known to generate high-fidelity samples, they often suffer from low sampling speed, requiring a large number of score function evaluations (oftentimes being neural network evaluations) to generate samples. For this reason, diffusion models incur considerably higher computational costs compared to single-step generators like generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or variational auto-encoders (VAEs) (Kingma, 2014), thus constraining their practicality in real-world applications that demand real-time data generation. To remedy this efficiency issue, researchers have proposed several acceleration schemes to speed up the sampling process of diffusion models. Prominent examples include the training-based method, such as model distillation (Luhman and Luhman, 2021; Salimans and Ho, 2022; Meng et al., 2023), noise level or sample trajectory learning (Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021; San-Roman et al., 2021), and consistency models (Song et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b). Despite their impressive performance, training-based acceleration methods incur enormous additional computational costs for training, and can be challenging to implement for large-scale pre-trained diffusion models. In contrast, an alternative class of acceleration methods is based on modifying the original diffusion models without additional training, offering the flexibility to wrap around any pre-trained diffusion models (see, e.g., Lu et al. (2022b); Zheng et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2024)). More detailed discussions about these training-free acceleration methods are deferred to Section 1.4. Despite their empirical successes, most theoretical guarantees of diffusion acceleration are established based on ODE-based algorithms (e.g., Lee et al. (2023); Li et al. (2024a); Huang et al. (2024)). In comparison, rigorous convergence analysis for SDE-based acceleration remains largely underexplored, in spite of extensive theoretical investigation for the first-order unaccelerated solvers (Chen et al., 2023a,c; Lee et al., 2022; Benton 3Sampler Distribution Score estimation Complexity Reference SDE-based Finite second moment ℓ2 score error ˜O(d/ε2) Benton et al. (2024) SDE-based Bounded ℓ2 score error ˜O(d3/ε) Li et al. (2024a) SDE-based Bounded ℓ2 score error ˜O(d3/2/ε) This work Table 1: The number of score function evaluations required to attainε2 error measured in KL divergence. In this table, we ignore the impact of score estimation errors, and focus only on SDE-based samplers. We only emphasize the dependency ond and ε, omitting logarithmic factors and other constants. et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024; Li and Yan, 2024b,a). Given the popularity of stochastic samplers (Song et al., 2020b; Lu et al., 2022c; Gonzalez et al., 2024) and the fact that they tend to generate higher fidelity samples compared to their ODE-based analog, it is of great interest to design principled SDE-based acceleration schemes and demonstrate their provable advantages. 1.3 Our contributions In this paper, we design a high-order SDE-based sampler, leveraging upon idea of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods. Our algorithm is training-free in nature. Each step only requires a single score function evaluation, introducing no extra per-step cost compared to DDPM. For a broad family of target data distributions in Rd, it only takes˜O(d3/2/ε) score function evaluations for our proposed sampler to yield a distribution that is ε2 close to the target distribution in KL divergence, provided that the score estimates are sufficiently accurate and thatε is sufficiently small. Compared to prior theory for accelerated SDE-based samplers, our result strengthens the state-of-the-art guarantees˜O(d3/ε) in terms of dimensional dependency. More precise comparisons between our results and previous theory on SDE-based samplers are provided in Table 1. To demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct a series of numerical experiments, as illustrated in Figure 1. More details can be found in Section 5. 1.4 Other related works Here, we briefly discuss several other prior theory on multiple aspects of diffusion models. Training-free acceleration schemes. A recent strand of works seeks to speed up ODE-based samplers via efficient ODE solvers. In particular, Zhang and Chen (2023) proposes DEIS, building on the semi-linear structure of the reverse process and utilizing the exponential integrator (Hochbruck and Ostermann, 2010). Similarly, Lu et al. (2022b) introduces the DPM-solver by combining high-order ODE solvers with the semi-linear framework, and further develop DPM-Solver++ to enhance stability in guided sampling (Lu et al., 2022c). Additionally, Zhao et al. (2024) establishes a predictor-corrector framework to accelerate diffusion sampling. In comparison, training-free acceleration for SDE-based samplers are considerably less explored. Jolicoeur-Martineau et al. (2021) designs an SDE solver based on stochastic Improved Euler’s method. Karras et al. (2022) proposes a a stochastic sampler that comines ODE integrator with a Langevin step. Motivated by Taylor expanding diffusion processes, Lu et al. (2022c) proposes SDE-DPM-Solver++. Xue et al. (2024) presents the SA-solver, leveraging the stochastic Adams method to accelerate sampling speed. The theoretical underpinnings about these stochastic acceleration methods, however, remain far from complete. Theory for ODE-based acceleration. In comparison to the theory for DDPM, the theoretical support for the ODE-based samplers has only been established fairly recently (Chen et al., 2023d; Li et al., 2024b; Benton et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c; Gao and Zhu, 2024; Huang et al., 2024), where the state-of-the-art convergence guarantees for the probability flow ODE are established by Li et al. (2024c). A first attempt towards the design of provably accelerated training-free ODE-based methods is made by Li et al. (2024a), which proposes and analyzes both ODE- and SDE-based acceleration algorithms. The accelerated ODE sampler proposed therein leverages a momentum-like term to enhance sample efficiency, and their accelerated SDE sampler is constructed using higher-order expansions of the conditional density. Both of 4these samplers come with improved non-asymptotic convergence guarantees compared to prior theory for the unaccelerated counterpart (Benton et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c). Furthermore, Huang et al. (2024) establish convergence guarantees for high-order ODE solvers in the context of diffusion models. Gupta et al. (2024) proposes to accelerate ODE-based samplers by incorporating a randomized midpoint method, achieving state-of-the-art dependency on the problem dimension. To bypass the complexity of developing an end-to-end theory for diffusion models, these studies often establish non-asymptotic convergence results assuming access to accurate score function estimates. Theory for score matching/estimation. In addition to the sampling phase, the score matching phase plays a crucial role in determining the sample quality (Hyvärinen and Dayan, 2005; Lu et al., 2022a; Koehler et al., 2022). To understand the finite-sample error of score function estimation, Block et al. (2020) provides estimation guarantees under theℓ2 metric in terms of the Rademacher complexity of a certain concept class. Chen et al. (2023b), Oko et al. (2023) and Tang and Yang (2024) characterize the sample complexity of diffusion models when the target distribution resides within some low-dimensional linear space, the Besov space, and low-dimensional manifold, respectively. More broadly, progress has been made within the theoretical community towards addressing multiple aspects arising in score estimation (see, e.g., Oko et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2024c); Wibisono et al. (2024); Dou et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024); Mei and Wu (2023); Feng et al. (2024)). From a more optimization perspective, Han et al. (2024) studies the optimization error of using two-layer neural networks for score estimation. 1.5 Notation For any positive integern, we denote[n] := {1,...,n }. For two sequences of non-negative real numbers {an}n∈N+ and {bn}n∈N+, we employ the notationan ≲ bn (resp. an ≳ bn) to indicate the existence of a universal constantC, such thatan ≤Cbn (resp. an ≥Cbn) holds for all sufficiently largen. The notation an = O(bn) means an ≲ bn, and ˜O(·) hides a factor that is polynomial in(log d,log ε−1,log δ−1). For any tensor T ∈Rd1×d2×d3 and matrixM ∈Rd2×d3, we defineT[M] to be a vector inRd1, such that thei-th entry of this vector is given by ( T[M] ) i = ∑ j∈[d2],k∈[d3] TijkMjk =: ⟨ T(i,·,·),M ⟩ . For any vectorv∈Rd3, we defineTv to be a matrix inRd1×d2, such that the(i,j)-th entry of this matrix is ( Tv ) i,j = ∑ k∈[d3] Tijkvk =: ⟨ T(i,j, ·),v ⟩ . Similarly, for any fourth order tensorT ∈Rd1×d2×d3×d4 and third order tensorA ∈Rd2×d3×d4, we define T[A] to be a vector inRd1, with thei-th entry given by ( T[A] ) i = ∑ j∈[d2],k∈[d3],ℓ∈[d4] TijkℓAjkℓ =: ⟨ T(i,·,·,·),A ⟩ . For any two random objectsX and Y, we sayX ⊥ ⊥Y if and only if they are statistically independent of each other. For two distributionsµand ν, we employµ⊗ν to represent the product distribution ofµand ν. For any random objectX, we useL(X) to denote its law (i.e., distribution). Moreover, for any vector-valued function s(t,x) : R ×Rd →Rd whose two arguments are inR and Rd, respectively, we denote by∇xs(t,x) ∈Rd×d (resp. ∇2 xs(t,x) ∈Rd×d×d) the Jacobian matrix (resp. Hessian) w.r.t. the second argument. For any two distributions, we denote byKL(p∥q) the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence fromq to p, and useTV(p,q) to represent the total-variation (TV) distance betweenp and q. For any positive integern, we also useperm(n) to denote the set of permutations of{1,...,n }. 2 Algorithm: a stochastic Runge-Kutta method In this section, we present the rationale underlying the design of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods, following some preliminaries about diffusion models from an SDE perspective. 52.1 Background: diffusion models through the lens of SDEs As mentioned previously, the diffusion generative modeling comprises a forward process and a reverse process. A widely adopted choice of the forward process can be described via the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process dXt = −Xtdt+ √ 2 dBf t, X 0 ∼q0, 0 ≤t≤T, (1) with q0 the target data distribution, and(Bf t)0≤t≤T a standard Brownian motion inRd independent fromX0. As is well-known, the solution to (1) enjoys the following marginal distribution Xt d = λtX0 + σtZ with λt := e−t and σt := √ 1 −e−2t (2) for any0 ≤t≤T, whereX0 ∼q0 and Z ∼N(0,Id) are independently generated. Throughout this paper, we shall denote byqt the distribution ofXt. How to reverse the above forward process(1) can be illuminated via a classical result in the SDE literature. To be precise, consider the following SDE dYt = [ Yt + 2s(t,Yt) ] dt+ √ 2 dBt, 0 ≤t≤T, (3) where (Bt)0≤t≤T is also a standard Brownian motion inRd independent ofY0, and s(t,x) := ∇xlog qT−t(x) (4) stands for the (Stein) score function. Classical results (Anderson, 1982; Haussmann and Pardoux, 1986) tell us that the distribution match between the above two stochastic processes in the sense that Yt d = XT−t, 0 ≤t≤T as long asY0 ∼qT, thus unveiling that(3) forms the reverse process of(1). As an important implication, if we have exact access to the score functions{s(t,·)}0≤t≤T as well asqT, then running the SDE(3) from Y0 suffices to yield a pointYT that exhibits the target distributionq0. Nevertheless, there are multiple implementation issues that prevent one from running the reverse process (3) in an exact manner. To begin with, it is unrealistic to assume exact access to the score functions; instead, one only has, for the most part, imperfect score estimates at hand. Secondly, due to the computational cost of evaluating each score function (which might involve, say, computing the output of a large neural network or transformer), it is preferable to solve the SDE(3) approximately with only a small number of score function evaluations; as a consequence, time-discretization of the SDE(3) is oftentimes necessary, in spite of the discretization error it inevitably incurs. Thirdly, the SDE(3) is typically not initialized toY0 ∼qT, but instead, some generic data-independent distribution likeN(0,Id) (given thatqT can be fairly close toN(0,Id) for large enoughT). These issues constitute three sources that result in the discrepancy betweenq0 and the distribution ofYT, with the first two sources (i.e., the score estimation error and the discretization error) having the most significant effects. 2.2 A stochastic Runge-Kutta method Runge-Kutta methods are a widely used family of iterative algorithms for approximating solutions to differential equations (Runge, 1895; Kutta, 1901), which enable the construction of high-order numerical solvers without requiring higher-order derivatives of the functions involved. Stochastic Runge-Kutta methods refer to a family of specialized adaptation of the general Runge-Kutta methods, designed specifically for solving SDEs (Burrage and Burrage, 1996). Motivated by the practical effectiveness of Runge-Kutta-type algorithms, we propose a high-order stochastic Runge-Kutta method—in conjunction with the use of the exponential integrator—for solving the reverse process described in Eq. (3). Here and throughout, we select K discretization time points0 = t0 <t1 <··· <tK <T , and define ∆k := tk+1 −tk for k∈{0,1,...,K −1}. (5) It is assumed that for eachtk (0 ≤k ≤K), we only have access to the estimateˆs(tk,·) of the true score function s(tk,·) = ∇xlog qT−tk(·). 6Preliminaries: exponential integrator, and SDE for scores.The use of the exponential integrator arises as a common algorithmic trick in SDE to cope with linear drift components. Reformulating the SDE in Eq. (3), we obtain an equivalent form d [ e−tYt ] = 2e−ts(t,Yt)dt+ √ 2 e−tdBt, 0 ≤t≤T, (6) whose drift term does not contain a linear component as in Eq. (3). As a result, for any sequence of discretization time points0 = t0 <t1 <··· <tK <T , we can take the integral to derive, for anyt∈[tk,tk+1], Yt = et−tkYtk + 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rs ( tk + r,Ytk+r ) dr+ √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdBtk+r. (7) In addition, the evolution ofs(t,Yt) can be characterized by means of another SDE. More specifically, applying the Itô formula (Øksendal, 2003) tos(t,Yt) yields ds(t,Yt) =∂ts(t,Yt)dt+ ∇xs(t,Yt) ( Yt + 2s(t,Yt) ) dt+ √ 2 ∇xs(t,Yt)dBt + ∇2 xs(t,Yt)[Id]dt, (8) where we recall the notation of∇2 xs(t,Yt)[Id] in Section 1.5. Prelude: DDPM as a first-order Runge-Kutta solver.We now turn to designing SDE solvers through the idea of the Runge-Kutta method. Let us begin with first-order score approximation and use it to describe the first-order Runge-Kutta solver. As a natural starting point, one can approximates(tk+ r,Ytk+r) in Eq. (7) by s(tk,Ytk) for everyr∈[0,∆k]. With this strategy in place, we arrive at the approximation Ytk+1 ≈e∆kYtk + 2(e∆k −1)s ( tk,Ytk ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r at the endpointt= tk+1. This motivates the following first-order SDE solver that computes ˆYtk+1 = e∆kˆYtk + 2 ( e∆k −1 ) ˆs ( tk,ˆYtk ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r (9) iteratively fork= 0,...,K −1, which coincides with the exponential integrator solver tailored to the DDPM sampler (Zhang and Chen, 2023). Our algorithm: a higher-order Runge-Kutta solver.In order to further speed up the DDPM-type sampler, we seek to exploit higher-order approximation. Rearrange Eq. (7) as follows: Ytk+1 = e∆kYtk + 2(e∆k −1)s ( tk,Ytk ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r + 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−r ( s ( tk + r,Ytk+r ) −s ( tk,Ytk )) dr. The idea is to approximate the score differences(tk+r,Ytk+r)−s(tk,Ytk) in the last term of the above display (as opposed to approximating the scores(tk + r,Ytk+r) as in the first-order solver). Let us first present the update rule of the proposed Runge-Kutta solver as follows, whose rationale will be elucidated momentarily: ˆYtk+1 = e∆kˆYtk + ( e∆k −e−∆k ) ˆs ( tk,ˆYtk + gtk,tk+1 ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r, (10a) where (Wt)0≤t≤T is a standard Brownian motion inRd to be used for the Runge-Kutta solver in discrete time (in order to differentiate it from the process(Bt)0≤t≤T used for the reverse process in Eq. (3)), and gtk,tk+1 is a Gaussian vector defined as gtk,tk+1 := 2 √ 2 e∆k −e−∆k ∫∆k 0 e∆k−r( Wtk+r −Wtk ) dr. (10b) We highlight several key properties of this algorithm. 7• Firstly, each iteration of(10a) only requires a single score function evaluation. This feature is in stark contrast with acceleration algorithms that demand higher-order computation. • If we setαk = e−2∆k, then the update rule (10a) reduces to ˆYtk+1 = 1√αk ( ˆYtk + (1 −αk)ˆs(tk,ˆYtk + ζk,1gk,1) ) + ζk,2gk,1 + ζk,3gk,3, (11) where gk,1,gk,2,gk,3 i.i.d. ∼ N(0,Id) are independent ofˆYtk, andζk,1,ζk,2,ζk,3 ∈R are certain functions of ∆k defined as follows: ζk,1 = 2 √ 2f1(∆k)1/2 e∆k −e−∆k , ζ k,2 = √ 2f3(∆k) f1(∆k)1/2 , ζ k,3 = √ 2f2(∆k) −2f3(∆k)2 f1(∆k) , with f1(∆) = e2∆/2 −2e∆ + ∆ + 3/2, f 2(∆) = e2∆/2 −1/2, f 3(∆) = e2∆/2 −e∆ + 1/2. (12) In addition, as∆k →0+, we have ζk,1∆−1/2 k → √ 2/3, ζ k,2∆−1/2 k → √ 3/2, ζ k,3∆−1/2 k → √ 1/2. (13) We observe that our acceleration method shares similarities with that proposed by Li et al. (2024a). They also adopt an algorithm of the form(11), but with different choices ofζk,1,ζk,2,ζk,3: in their formulation, ζk,1∆−1/2 k →1, ζk,2∆−1/2 k →1, andζk,3∆−1/2 k →1 as ∆k →0+. In terms of technical motivation, their approach is based on high-order expansion of the probability density function, while our algorithm is motivated by the Runge-Kutta method for SDEs. The whole procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1, described using the implementation-friendly form (11). Rationale behind the construction of our Runge-Kutta solver (10). To understand the ra- tionale underlying the above construction, we first note that in the SDE in Eq. (8), the term that dominates is √ 2∇xs(t,Yt)dBt, and hence it is tempting to approximates(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) by√ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Btk+r −Btk) to reach Ytk+1 ≈e∆kYtk + 2 ( e∆k −1 ) s ( tk,Ytk ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r + 2 √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−r∇xs ( tk,Ytk )( Btk+r −Btk ) dr. (14) Note, however, that an approach designed directly based on(14) could be computationally expensive in practice, given that it requires evaluating the Jacobian of the score function — a(d×d)-dimensional object that is in general either inaccessible or too costly to estimate. To remedy this issue, we propose an alternative solution. Observe from the Taylor expansion that ( e∆k −e−∆k )( s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1 ) −s ( tk,Ytk )) ≈ ( e∆k −e−∆k ) ∇xs(tk,Ytk)gtk,tk+1 = 2 √ 2 ∇xs(tk,Ytk) ∫∆k 0 e∆k−r( Btk+r −Btk ) dr, (15) where we takegtk,tk+1 = 2 √ 2 e∆k−e−∆k ∫∆k 0 e∆k−r( Btk+r −Btk ) dr. This suggests that the last term in Eq. (14) can be well approximated by the difference of two score functions, without the need of computing the gradient of the score functions. Substituting Eq. (15) into Eq. (14) gives Ytk+1 ≈e∆kYtk + 2 ( e∆k −1 ) s ( tk,Ytk ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r + ( e∆k −e−∆k )( s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1 ) −s ( tk,Ytk )) = e∆kYtk + ( e∆k −e−∆k ) s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1 ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r + { 2(e∆k −1) −e∆k + e−∆k } s ( tk,Ytk ) ≈e∆kYtk + ( e∆k −e−∆k ) s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1 ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdBtk+r, 8Algorithm 1:A stochastic Runge-Kutta method for diffusion models. 1 inputs: score estimates{ˆs(t,·)}, time interval[0,T], discretization time points0 = t0 <··· <tK <T . 2 generate Y0 ∼N(0,Id). 3 for k= 0,1,...,K −1 do 4 compute ˆYtk+1 = 1√αk ( ˆYtk + (1 −αk)ˆs ( tk,ˆYtk + ζk,1gk,1 )) + ζk,2gk,1 + ζk,3gk,3, (17) where αk = e−2∆k with ∆k = tk+1 −tk, gk,1,gk,2,gk,3 ∼i.i.d. N(0,Id) are independent ofˆYtk, and ζk,1,ζk,2,ζk,3 ∈R are functions of∆k, as defined in Eq. (12). where the last line drops a higher-order term in view of the following approximation 2(e∆k −1) −e∆k + e−∆k = e∆k + e−∆k −2 = O ( ∆2 k ) . (16) Consequently, we arrive at the proposed approximation scheme as described in Eq. (10a). Here, we use the coefficient (e∆k −e−∆k) instead of2(e∆k −1) (as suggested by the exponential integrator) for two main reasons: (1) when∆k is sufficiently small, the two coefficients are approximately equivalent, as shown in Eq. (16), and (2) the first coefficient is more commonly used in mainstream diffusion models (e.g., the DDPM sampler (Ho et al., 2020)). 3 Theoretical guarantees In this section, we present a convergence theory for the proposed stochastic Runge-Kutta solver in Algorithm 1. Let us begin by stating a couple of key assumptions, with the first one concerning the boundedness of the target data distribution. Assumption A(bounded support). Assume the target distributionq0 obeys PY∼q0 ( ∥Y∥2 ≤R ) = 1 for some quantityR> 0. Without loss of generality, we assume throughout thatR= √ d. Note that for any distribution with bounded support, we can always achieve this by properly rescaling the data. The next assumption below imposes a few conditions on the choice of the discretization time points 0 = t0 <··· <tK <T , where we recall that∆k = tk+1 −tk. A concrete choice of valid discretization time points shall be provided momentarily in Corollary 3.5. Assumption B(discretization time points). Suppose that there existsκ∈(0,1/4), such that ∆k ≤κmin{1,(T −tk+1)2}, k = 0,1,··· ,K −1 and d2κ≲ 1. (18) It is further assumed that 1.3∆k + ( 53∆k + 10∆2 k )( σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk ) d≤1/2, k = 0,1,··· ,K −1, (19) where we recall the definition ofλt and σt in (2). In addition, we assume thatδ= T −tK >0. Remark 3.1. One can often interpretκ as a proxy for the step size. The upper bound1/4 in Assumption B is not crucial and can be replaced by any positive numerical constant. Remark 3.2. The assumption ofδ being positive implies early stopping when tracking the reverse process. This step is essential, as for non-smooth target distributions, the score functions(t,·) can diverge ast→T. In 9effect, our algorithm approximates a slightly noised distributionqδ rather than the exact target distribution q0, which is acceptable for a sufficiently smallδ. Moreover,qδ and q0 are close in Wasserstein distance. This early stopping technique is commonly used in both practical applications and theoretical analysis of diffusion models (Song et al., 2020b; Benton et al., 2024). Furthermore, we are still in need of assumptions that capture the accuracy of the estimated score functions, as stated below. Assumption C(score estimation error). Suppose that the score estimates{ˆs(t,·)}satisfy the following properties: 1. For everyk= 0,1,··· ,K −1, it holds that sup ak∈Ik,bk∈I′ k E [ˆs(tk,akYtk+1 + bkg) −s(tk,akYtk+1 + bkg) 2 2 ] ≤ε2 score,k, where Ik = [1 −3.1√∆kκ,1 + 3.1√∆kκ], I′ k = [0,3.5∆1/2 k ], andYtk+1 ∼qT−tk+1 and g ∼N(0,Id) are independently generated. Recall thatκ is the stepsize proxy, as defined in Assumption B. 2. For allk= 0,1,··· ,K −1, it holds that sup y∈Rd σ2 T−tk λT−tk ˆs(tk,y) −s(tk,y)  2 ≤2 √ d. Remark 3.3. To interpret the second point of Assumption C, observe thatλ−1 T−t(σ2 T−ts(t,y) + y) = m(t,y), where m(t,y) = E[θ |λT−tθ+ σT−tg = y] with (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Under Assumption A, it holds that ∥m(t,y)∥2 ≤ √ d for allt ∈[0,T] and y ∈Rd. Similarly, we defineˆm(t,y) = λ−1 T−t(σ2 T−tˆs(t,y) + y). Then Assumption C is equivalent to assuming sup y∈Rd ˆm(t,y) −m(t,y)  2 ≤2 √ d, for allt∈{t0,t1,··· ,tK−1}. (20) which is valid as long as∥ˆm(t,y)∥2 ≤ √ d. For a generalˆs, the second point of Assumption C is always satisfied by projectingˆm(t,y) = λ−1 T−t(σ2 T−tˆs(t,y)+ y) onto thed-dimensional ball{x∈Rd : ∥x∥2 ≤ √ d}. Furthermore, this projection reduces the score estimation error. Specifically, if we denote the projection operator byP, and let ˆsP(t,y) := σ−2 T−t(λT−tP( ˆm(t,y)) −y), then it holds that∥ˆsP(t,y) −s(t,y)∥2 ≤∥ˆs(t,y) −s(t,y)∥2. We are now positioned to present our convergence guarantees for the proposed Runge-Kutta method, as stated in the following theorem. Here and throughout,poutput stands for the distribution of the outputˆYtK of Algorithm 1. Theorem 3.4. Under Assumptions A, B and C, Algorithm 1 achieves KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T) + κ1/2d K−1∑ k=0 ε1/2 score,kσT−tkλ−1/2 T−tk + de−2T. The proof of Theorem 3.4 is postponed to Section 4. In the next corollary, we derive the upper bound for KL divergence based on a specific stepsize selection. The proof of this corollary is provided in Appendix C.8. Corollary 3.5. Consider any early stopping pointδ∈(0,1/2) and any desired accuracy levelε2. 1. If ε≤1/ √ d, then there existT and 0 = t0 <t1 <··· <tK = T −δ such that Algorithm 1 achieves KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≲ ε2 + ε3d5/2δ−1 + K−1∑ k=0 d1/2ε1/2 score,k with K = ˜O ( d3/2(εδ)−1) . 102. If √ d/2 ≥ε ≥1/ √ d, then there existT and 0 = t0 < t1 < ··· < tK = T −δ such that Algorithm 1 yields KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≲ ε2 + ε3d5/2δ−1 + K−1∑ k=0 d1/2ε1/2 score,k with K = ˜O(d2δ−1). When attaining the above upper bounds, we take∆K−1 = κδ2, and ∆k−1 = min{κ,∆k(1 + √κ∆k)2}for k= K−1,K −2,··· ,1. More details are given in Appendix C.8. When the score estimation errors are negligible (i.e.,εscore,k ≈0) andε is sufficiently small, Corollary 3.5 implies that Algorithm 1 requires ˜O ( d3/2(εδ)−1) steps—or equivalently,˜O(d3/2(εδ)−1) score function evaluations—to yield a distribution that is withinε2- KL-divergence to an early-stopped target distribution. In contrast, (1) the state-of-the-art convergence rate for unaccelerated diffusion model is˜O(d/ε2) (Benton et al., 2024), so that our theory exhibits improved ε-dependency. Also, the iteration complexity established for the SDE-based accelerated algorithm in Li et al. (2024a) is ˜O(d3/ε), and hence our result exhibits betterd-dependency than the theory presented in Li et al. (2024a). It is also noteworthy that the analyses in both Benton et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024a) offer a more favorable dependency on the score estimation error. We believe that our less favorable dependency on the score errors stems from our technical limitations as opposed to the algorithm drawback; improving this dependency calls for new techniques that we leave for future research. Remark 3.6. It is worth noting that our theory is stated in terms of the KL divergence between the algorithm output and the target distribution. While one can simply invoke the Pinsker inequality (i.e., TV(qδ,poutput) ≤ √ KL(qδ ∥poutput)/2 ) to obtain an upper bound on the total-variation distance, this approach has been shown to be sub-optimal for stochastic samplers like DDPM. In fact, the concurrent work Li and Yan (2024b) has established the striking result thatTV(qδ,poutput) could be order-of-magnitudes better than√ KL(qδ ∥poutput)/2 for DDPM. How to obtain the desired control on the TV metric for our proposed sampler is left for future investigation. 4 Analysis In this section, we provide an overview of the proof strategies for Theorem 3.4, with detailed proofs deferred to the appendix. Step 1: constructing an auxiliary process.To facilitate analysis, we introduce the following auxiliary stochastic process, obtained by replacing the estimated scoreˆs(tk,·) with the true scores(tk,·) in the update rule (10a) and initializing it to the distributionqT: Yt0 ∼qT, Ytk+1 = e∆kYtk + ( e∆k −e−∆k ) s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1 ) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r, 0 ≤k<K, (21) where we recall thatgtk,tk+1 ∈Rd is a Gaussian random vector defined in Eq. (10b). Given that the process (21) is defined only at the discretization time points{tk}, we find it convenient to introduce a natural interpolation of Eq. (21) to cover all time instances: for anyt∈(tk,tk+1), take Yt = et−tkYtk + ( et−tk −e−t+tk ) s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,t ) + √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r. (22) where gtk,t := 2 √ 2 et−tk −e−t+tk ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r( Wtk+r −Wtk ) dr. (23) 11Before proceeding, let us compare the auxiliary process(Yt) with the exact reverse process(Yt). Recall that the true reverse process can be rearranged as (cf. Eq. (7)): Yt = et−tkYtk + 2(et−tk −1)s(tk,Ytk) + √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdBtk+r + 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r( s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) ) dr. (24) Taking the differential of processes (22) and (24) and rearranging terms reveal that: for anyt∈(tk,tk+1], dYt = [ et−tkYtk + (et−tk + e−t+tk)s ( tk,Ytk + gtk,t ) + √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r ] dt+ √ 2 dWt + 2 √ 2 ∇xs ( tk,Ytk + gtk,t )( Wt −Wtk ) dt+ 2 √ 2 ∇xs ( tk,Ytk + gtk,t )∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r( Wtk+r −Wtk ) drdt −2 √ 2(et−tk + e−t+tk) et−tk −e−t+tk ∇xs ( tk,Ytk + gtk,t )∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r( Wtk+r −Wtk ) drdt, (25a) dYt = et−tk [ Ytk + 2s(tk,Ytk) + √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 e−rdBtk+r ] dt+ 2 ( s(t,Yt) −s(tk,Ytk) ) dt+ √ 2 dBt + 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r( s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) ) drdt. (25b) For notational simplicity, we shall often abbreviate Eq. (25) by dYt = F ( t,Ytk,(Ws −Wtk)tk≤s≤t ) dt+ √ 2dWt (26a) dYt = F ( t,(Ys)tk≤s≤t,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t ) dt+ √ 2dBt (26b) in the sequel, where the definitions of the mappingsFand Fare clear from the context. From the original definition of the reverse process in Eq. (3), it can be easily shown that (which we omit here for brevity) F ( t,(Ys)tk≤s≤t,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t ) = Yt + 2s(t,Yt). (27) As a result, we shall often adopt the following more concise notation F(t,Yt) = F ( t,(Ys)tk≤s≤t,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t ) = Yt + 2s(t,Yt). (28) Step 2: characterizing the effect of time-discretization errors.With the aforementioned properties in mind, this step seeks to upper bound the KL divergence between the two processes(Yt) and (Yt)—both initialized byY0 d = Y0 ∼qT—by means of Girsanov’s Theorem. On a high level, the primary purpose of this step is to characterize the impact of the time-discretization error and the approximation error due to the application of the Runge-Kutta method, given that both the reverse process(Yt) and its time-discretized counterpart (Yt) are constructed using exact score functions. To begin with, we upper bound the KL divergence between(Yt) and (Yt) using the differences between the mappings Fand Fintroduced in Step 1, as stated below. Lemma 4.1. Denote byQT−δ (resp. QT−δ) the distribution of(Yt)0≤t≤T−δ (resp. (Yt)0≤t≤T−δ), which we recall are respectively defined in Eqs.(24) and (22) from initializationY0 d = Y0 ∼qT. Then under Assumption A, it holds that KL(QT−δ ∥QT−δ) ≤ K−1∑ k=0 lim inf τ→0+ ∫tk+1 tk+τ E [F(t,Yt) −F ( t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t )2 2 ] dt. 12In the above display,(Yt)0≤t≤T−δ ∼QT−δ, and(Hτ s)tk≤s≤tk+1 is a stochastic process satisfying dHτ t = 1√ 2 ( F(t,Yt) −F ( t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t )) dt+ dBt, t k + τ ≤t≤tk+1 (Hτ s)tk≤s≤tk+τ = (Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤tk+τ. (29) Note that the distribution of(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t depends on the value ofτ ∈(0,∆k). The proof of Lemma 4.1 is deferred to Appendix C.1. The existence and the uniqueness of process (29) are also established therein. In the next lemma, we show the proximity of the process(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t is and the Brownian motion increment process (Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t. The proof of this lemma is postponed to Appendix C.2. Lemma 4.2. Consider anyτ ∈(0,∆k). Under Assumptions A and B, we have the following upper bounds: E [ sup tk≤t≤tk+1 Bt −Btk −Hτ t 2 2 ] ≲ σ−2 T−tk+1∆4 kd+ (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)2∆3 kd3 + λ4 T−tk+1σ−12 T−tk+1∆4 kd3 + λ2 T−tk+1σ−8 T−tk+1∆4 kd, E [ sup tk≤t≤tk+1 Bt −Btk −Hτ t 4 2 ] ≲ σ−4 T−tk+1∆8 kd2 + (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)4∆6 kd6 + λ8 T−tk+1σ−24 T−tk+1∆8 kd6 + λ4 T−tk+1σ−16 T−tk+1∆8 kd2. With Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 in mind, we can readily develop a more concise upper bound onKL(QT−δ ∥QT−δ), as stated below. The proof of this lemma can be found in Appendix C.3. Lemma 4.3. Under Assumptions A and B, it holds that KL(QT−δ ∥QT−δ) ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T). Step 3: bounding the effect of score estimation errors.We still need to take into account the impact of the score estimation error. In this regard, we recall process(10a), and denote byˆQdis T−δ (resp. Qdis T−δ ) the distribution of(ˆYtk)0≤k≤K (resp. (Ytk)0≤k≤K). The next lemma attempts to upper boundKL(Qdis T−δ ∥ˆQdis T−δ); its proof is deferred to Appendix C.4. Lemma 4.4.Suppose that Assumptions A, B and C hold, and that both processes(ˆYt) and (Yt) are initialized to Y0 d = ˆY0 ∼qT. Then, it holds that KL(Qdis T−δ ∥ˆQdis T−δ) ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T) + K−1∑ k=0 ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd λ1/2 T−tk . Step 4: determining the impact of initialization errors.In practice, we typically have no access to qT, and a common strategy is to replace it withN(0,Id). Consider process(10a), but with initialization ˆY0 ∼ N(0,Id) instead of ˆY0 ∼ qT. In this case, we denote the distribution of ˆYT−δ by poutput. With ˆY0 ∼N(0,Id), we denote the distribution of(ˆYtk)0≤k≤K that follows the update rule(11) by ˆPdis T−δ, in contrast to ˆQdis T−δ which is the distribution of the same process withˆY0 ∼qT. Note that for(y0,y1,··· ,yK) ∈Rd(K+1), dQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) d ˆPdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) = dQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) d ˆQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) ·d ˆQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) d ˆPdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) = dQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) d ˆQdis T−δ(y0,··· ,yK) ·dqT(y0) dπd(y0) , where πd represents the distribution of ad-dimensional standard Gaussian random vector. Using the above distribution, we obtain KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≤KL ( Qdis T−δ ∥ˆPT−δ ) = KL ( Qdis T−δ ∥ˆQdis T−δ ) + KL(qT ∥πd). (30) 13Further, recall thatqT has the same distribution asλTθ+ σTg, where(θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Hence, the data processing inequality tells us that KL(qT ∥πd) ≤KL ( q0 ⊗qT ∥q0 ⊗N(0,Id) ) = 1 2 ( −dlog σ2 T −d+ dσ2 T + e−2TEθ∼q0[∥θ∥2 2] ) ≲ de−2T. (31) Substituting the above upper bound Eq. (31) and Lemma 4.4 into Eq. (30), we arrive at KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T) + K−1∑ k=0 ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd λ1/2 T−tk + de−2T as claimed. 5 Numerical experiments In this section, we illustrate the practical performance of Algorithm 1 on various image generation tasks. For benchmarking, we resort to the original DDPM sampling scheme (Ho et al., 2020) along with the SDE-based acceleration method proposed in Li et al. (2024a), ensuring that all methods adopt the same pre-trained score estimates. More specifically, we utilize the pre-trained score functions from Nichol and Dhariwal (2021) and focus on two datasets: ImageNet-64 (Chrabaszcz et al., 2017) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). Note that we have not attempted to optimize the generative modeling performance with additional techniques (e.g., employing better score functions or training with higher quality datasets), as our primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed acceleration method. Our approach is compatible with a variety of diffusion model codebases and datasets, where we anticipate observing similar acceleration effects. In our experiments, we compare the Fréchet inception distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) of the images generated by the vanilla DDPM, the SDE acceleration method proposed in Li et al. (2024a), and our proposed method (the Stochastic Runge-Kutta method). FID quantifies the similarity between the distribution of the generated images and the target distribution, with lower FID values indicating greater similarity. For each method and step size combination, we generate104 images and compute the corresponding FID. The numerical results are summarized below. CIFAR-10. Figure 2 presents the simulation results for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The left panel shows images generated by our method and the vanilla DDPM, while the right panel illustrates the evolution of FID across different NFEs, ranging from 10 to 100. Note that here NFE is equal to the number of diffusion steps, as each step requires only one score evaluation for all methods. The generated images suggest that our method produces less noisy outputs. Moreover, our method consistently outperforms the other two methods in terms of FID across all step sizes. ImageNet-64. Figure 3 shows the simulation results for the ImageNet-64 dataset, where we observe similar improvements as what happens for the CIFAR-10 dataset. 6 Discussion In this paper, we have made progress in provably speeding up SDE-based diffusion samplers. In comparison to prior results, the convergence guarantees of our accelerated algorithm enjoy improved dimension-dependency, shedding light on the advantages of the stochastic Runge-Kutta approach. Remarkably, our algorithm paves the way for designing even higher-order SDE-based diffusion solvers, the advantages of which will be explored in future research. Moving forward, there are plenty of directions that are worth pursuing. For instance, the dependency on the dimensiond and the score estimation error remains sub-optimal, and more refined analyses are needed in order to tighten our result. Also, as mentioned previously, establishing sharp TV-type upper bound for 14Images generated using vanilla DDPM.

Furthermore, the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) has demonstrated the remarkable capability of DDPM in adapting to unknown low-dimensional structure; whether this appealing feature is inherited by our accelerated stochastic sampler is worth investigating. Finally, it would be important to develop fast and principled diffusion-based samplers that allow one to sample with guidance in a provably efficient manner (see, e.g., Wu et al. (2024); Chidambaram et al. (2024)). Acknowledgements Y. Chen is supported in part by the Alfred P.

A Technical lemmas We collect in this section a couple of technical lemmas that are useful in establishing our main results. Lemma A.1. Denote by (Wt)t≥0 a standard Brownian motion inRd. Then for all tk ≤t < tk+1, the covariance matrices of the following vectors are given by Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr ] = [ e2t−2tk/2 −2et−tk + (t−tk + 3/2) ] ·Id =: f1(t−tk) ·Id, Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr, Wt −Wtk ] = [ et−tk −t+ tk −1 ] ·Id, Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r ] = [ e2(t−tk)/2 −1/2 ] ·Id =: f2(t−tk) ·Id, Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr, ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r ] = [ e2(t−tk)/2 −et−tk + 1/2 ] ·Id =: f3(t−tk) ·Id. Here, we define, for notational simplicity, the following functions: for any∆ >0, let f1(∆) = e2∆/2 −2e∆ + ∆ + 3/2, f2(∆) = e2∆/2 −1/2, f3(∆) = e2∆/2 −e∆ + 1/2. (32) Proof of Lemma A.1.For tk ≤t<t k+1, set H(t) = Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr ] = E [(∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr )⊗2] . Observe thatH(tk) = 0d×d. Taking the derivative ofH(t) with respect tot, we reach H′(t) = E [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr⊗ ( Wt −Wtk + ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr )] + E [( Wt −Wtk + ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr ) ⊗ ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr ] = 2H(t) + ( 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rrdr ) Id 16= 2H(t) + 2(et−tk −t+ tk −1) ·Id. Solving the above ordinary differential equation yields H(t) = (1 2e2t−2tk −2et−tk + (t−tk + 3/2) ) Id, thereby completing the proof of the first advertised identity. As for the second claimed identity, we make the observation that Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr, Wt −Wtk ] = (∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rrdr ) Id = ( et−tk −t+ tk −1 ) ·Id. With regards to the third claimed identity, we have Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r ] = (∫t−tk 0 e2(t−tk−r)dr ) Id = 1 2 ( e2(t−tk) −1 ) Id. To prove the last result, it is seen that Cov [∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Wtk+r −Wtk)dr, ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r ] = (∫t−tk 0 ∫t−tk 0 e2(t−tk)−r−s1 s≤rdsdr ) Id = (∫t−tk 0 ∫r 0 e2(t−tk)−r−sdsdr ) Id = (1 2e2(t−tk) −et−tk + 1 2 ) Id. The proof is thus complete. Lemma A.2. Consider any random objectM ∈Rd×d and any random variableα∈R, as well as a filtration F. Then, it holds that E [E[αM |F] 4 F ] ≤ √ E[α8] ·E [ ∥M∥8 F ] . Proof of Lemma A.2.It follows from Cauchy–Schwarz that∥E[αM |F]∥2 F ≤E[α2 |F]E[∥M∥2 F |F], which in turn yields E [E[αM |F] 4 F ] ≤E [ E[α2 |F]2E [ ∥M∥2 F |F ]2] ≤E [ E[α2 |F]4]1/2 E [ E[∥M∥2 F |F]4]1/2 ≤ √ E[α8]E [ ∥M∥8 F ] . Lemma A.3. For any0 ≤t0 <t0 + t<T , the reverse process(Yt)0≤t≤T (cf. Eq.(3)) obeys E [Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 2 2 ] ≲ dσ−2 T−t0−tt2, E [Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 4 2 ] ≲ d2σ−4 T−t0−tt4. Proof of Lemma A.3.For notational convenience, we define, for anyt≥0, D(t) := E [ ∥Yt0+t−Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t+√ 2Bt0∥2 2 ] , which clearly obeysD(0) = 0. It then follows that |D′(t)|= 2 ⏐⏐⏐E [⟨ Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t),Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 ⟩]⏐⏐⏐ ≤2E [Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t) 2 2 ]1/2 D(t)1/2 ≲ √ dσ−1 T−t0−tD(t)1/2. Here, the first inequality arises from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and the second inequality holds since E [Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t) 2 2 ] ≲ E [Yt0+t 2 2 ] + E [s(t0 + t,Yt0+t) 2 2 ] = E [XT−t0−t 2 2 ] + E [s(t0 + t,XT−t0−t) 2 2 ] 17≲ d+ dσ−2 T−t0−t ≍dσ−2 T−t0−t, where the last line invokes Benton et al. (2024, Lemma 6) as well as Assumption A withR= √ d. In view of the ODE comparison theorem, we see thatD(t) ≲ dσ−2 T−t0−tt2, thus establishing the first result of this lemma. Similarly, we defineD(t) := E[∥Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0∥4 2] with D(0) = 0. Taking the derivative of D, we see from Hölder’s inequality that |D ′ (t)|= 4 ⏐⏐⏐E [⟨ Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t),Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 ⟩Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 2 2 ]⏐⏐⏐ ≤4E [Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t) 4 2 ]1/4 E [Yt0+t −Yt0 − √ 2Bt0+t + √ 2Bt0 4 2 ]3/4 = 4E [Yt0+t + 2s(t0 + t,Yt0+t) 4 2 ]1/4 D(t)3/4 ≲ √ dσ−1 T−t0−tD(t)3/4, which in turn implies thatD(t) ≲ d2σ−4 T−t0−tt4. This concludes the proof. B Properties of the score function In this section, we gather several useful properties of the ground-truth score function{s(t,·)}. Recall that the true score functions admit the following expression s(T −t,x) = λtm(t,x) −x σ2 t , with m(t,x) = E (θ,g)∼q0⊗N(0,Id) [ θ|λtθ+ σtg= x ] , (33) where we recall thatλt = e−t and σt = √ 1 −e−2t. In addition, we find it convenient to define the function f0(θ,x,t ) := λ2 t σ4 t ∥θ∥2 2 −λt + λ3 t σ4 t ⟨x,θ⟩. (34) Lemma B.1. Recall thatqt is the distribution ofλtθ+ σtg for (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Under Assumption A, ∂t∇xlog qt(x) = −λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t m(t,x) + 2λ2 t σ4 t x−λ2 t(2 −σ2 t) σ6 t Ct(x)x+ λ3 t σ6 t vt(x) holds for anyx∈Rd and t∈(0,T], where m(t,x) = E[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] ∈Rd, Ct(x) = Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] ∈Rd×d, vt(x) = E [ ∥θ∥2 2 ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] ∈Rd. Proof of Lemma B.1.Recall from Eq. (33) that ∇xlog qt(x) = s(T −t,x) = λtm(t,x) −x σ2 t , where m(t,x) = E[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] for (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). To begin with, it is easily seen that ∂t(σ−2 t ) = −2λ2 tσ−4 t , ∂ t(λtσ−2 t ) = −λt(2 −σ2 t)σ−4 t . (35) Next, we turn to∂tm(t,x), and observe that m(t,x) = ∫ θexp(λtσ−2 t ⟨x,θ⟩−λ2 tσ−2 t ∥θ∥2 2/2)q0(dθ)∫ exp(λtσ−2 t ⟨x,θ⟩−λ2 tσ−2 t ∥θ∥2 2/2)q0(dθ) . 18Given our bounded fourth-moment assumption onq0, we can readily apply Fubini’s theorem and exchange the order of differentiation and integration, which leads to the following equation ∂tm(t,x) =λ2 t σ4 t E [ ∥θ∥2 2 ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] −λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t E [ ⟨x,θ⟩ ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] =λ2 t σ4 t vt(x) −λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t Ct(x)x. (36) The proof can thus be completed by putting together Eqs. (35) and (36). Lemma B.2. Suppose that the target distributionq0 has finite fourth moment. Then, for allt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, the following identities hold: 1. ∇xs(T −t,x) = −σ−2 t Id + λ2 tσ−4 t Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x]. 2. ∇2 xs(T −t,x) = λ3 tσ−6 t E [( θ−m(t,x) ) ⊗ ( θ−m(t,x) ) ⊗ ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] . 3. ∂ts(T−t,x) = −(λt+ λ3 t)σ−4 t m(t,x) + 2λ2 tσ−4 t x+ λtσ−2 t E [ (θ−m(t,x))f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] , with f0(θ,x,t ) defined in Eq.(34). This expression can also be equivalently rewritten as ∂ts(T −t,x) = −λt σ2 t E [ θ|λtθ+ σtg= x ] + 2λ2 t σ3 t E [ g|λtθ+ σtg= x ] + λt σ2 t E [( θ−m(t,x) ) f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] . Proof of Lemma B.2.The first identity has been established in, e.g., Benton et al. (2024, Lemma 5). To establish the second identity claimed in the lemma, we observe that: from our assumption thatq0 has bounded fourth moment, we can apply Fubini’s theorem and exchange the order of differentiation and integration to obtain ∇2 xs(T −t,x) = λ2 tσ−4 t ∇xCov [ θ|λtθ+ σtg= x ] = λ3 tσ−6 t E [( θ−m(t,x) ) ⊗ ( θ−m(t,x) ) ⊗ ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] . This proves the second point of the lemma. Finally, we prove the third identity claimed in the lemma. Invoking Lemma B.1 gives ∂ts(T −t,x) = ∂t∇xlog qt(x) = −λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t m(t,x) + 2λ2 t σ4 t x−λ2 t(2 −σ2 t) σ6 t Ct(x)x+ λ3 t σ6 t vt(x) = −λt + λ3 t σ4 t m(t,x) + 2λ2 t σ4 t x+ λt σ2 t E [( θ−m(t,x) ) f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] , where Ct(x) := Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] and vt(x) := E [ ∥θ∥2 2 ( θ−m(t,x) ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] with (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗ N(0,Id). The proof is complete by taking advantage of the identityx= λtm(t,x)+ σtE[g|λtθ+σtg= x]. Lemma B.3. Assume that the target distributionq0 has finite fourth moment. Then, for allt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, it holds that ∂t∇xs(T −t,x) = 2λ2 t σ4 t Id + (2λ2 t σ4 t −4λ2 t σ6 t ) Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] + λ2 t σ4 t E [( θ−m(t,x) )( θ−m(t,x) )⊤( f0(θ,x,t ) −E [ f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ]) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] . Proof of Lemma B.3.Since q0 has bounded fourth moment, by Fubini’s theorem we can exchange the order of differentiation and integration. In addition, by the third point of Lemma B.2, we know that ∂ts(T −t,x) = −(λt + λ3 t)σ−4 t m(t,x) + 2λ2 tσ−4 t x+ λtσ−2 t E [( θ−m(t,x) ) f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] . 19As a consequence, we can compute ∇x∂ts(T −t,x) = 2λ2 t σ4 t Id −2λ2 t + 2λ4 t σ6 t Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x] + λ2 t σ4 t E [( θ−m(t,x) )( θ−m(t,x) )⊤( f0(θ,x,t ) −E[f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x] ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] as claimed. Lemma B.4. Assume that the target distributionq0 has finite fourth moment. Then, for allt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, it holds that ∂t∇2 xs(T −t,x) = −3(λ3 t + λ5 t) σ8 t E [( θ−m(t,x) )⊗3 |λtθ+ σtg= x ] − λ3 t 2σ6 t ∑ π∈perm(3) Mπ + λ3 t σ6 t E [( θ−m(t,x) )⊗3( f0(θ,x,t ) −E[f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x] ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] , where forπ∈perm(3) and i1,i2,i3 ∈[d], we take (Mπ)i1i2i3 = E[(θiπ(1) −miπ(1))(θiπ(2) −miπ(2)) |λtθ+ σtg= x] ×E[(θiπ(3) −miπ(3))(f0(θ,x,t ) −mf0) |λtθ+ σtg= x]. In the above display, mi = E[θi |λtθ+ σtg= x] and mf0 = E[f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x]. Proof of Lemma B.4.With the bounded fourth-moment assumption onq0 in place, one can apply Fubini’s theorem to swap the order of differentiation and integration and obtain ∂t∇2 xs(T −t,x) = ∇x∂t∇xs(T −t,x) = −2λ2 t + 2λ4 t σ6 t ∇xCov [ θ|λtθ+ σtg= x ] + λ2 t σ4 t ∇xE [( θ−m(t,x) )( θ−m(t,x) )⊤( f0(θ,x,t ) −E [ f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x ]) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] = −3(λ3 t + λ5 t) σ8 t E [( θ−m(t,x) )⊗3 |λtθ+ σtg= x ] − λ3 t 2σ6 t ∑ π∈perm(3) Mπ + λ3 t σ6 t E [ (θ−m(t,x))⊗3(f0(θ,x,t ) −E[f0(θ,x,t ) |λtθ+ σtg= x]) |λtθ+ σtg= x ] as claimed. Lemma B.5. Assume that the target distributionq0 has finite fourth moment. Then, for allt∈(0,T] and x∈Rd, it holds that ∇3 xs(T −t,x) = λ4 t σ8 t ( E [( θ−m(t,x) )⊗4 |λtθ+ σtg= x ] −T ( Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x]⊗2)) ∈Rd4 . Here, for any tensorX ∈Rd×d×d×d, we takeT(X) = ∑ π∈perm(4) Tπ(X)/8 and Tπ(X) ∈Rd×d×d×d, such that Tπ(X)i1i2i3i4 = Xiπ(1)iπ(2)iπ(3)iπ(4). Proof of Lemma B.5.Let us invoke Fubini’s theorem to swap the order of differentiation and integration, thus leading to ∇3 xs(T −t,x) = λ3 tσ−6 t ∇xE[(θ−m(t,x)) ⊗(θ−m(t,x)) ⊗(θ−m(t,x)) |λtθ+ σtg= x] 20= λ4 tσ−8 t · ( E[(θ−m(t,x))⊗4 |λtθ+ σtg= x] −T(Cov[θ|λtθ+ σtg= x]⊗2) ) The proof is thus complete. Lemma B.6.We assume Assumption A. Recall thatXT−t is defined in Eq.(3) and has marginal distribution qt. Then, fort∈(0,T], it holds that E [∂t∇xlog qt(XT−t) 2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ6 t . Proof of Lemma B.6.Invoking Lemma B.1, we obtain the following upper bound: E [∂t∇xlog qt(XT−t) 2 2 ] (37) ≲ E [−λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t m(t,XT−t) + 2λ2 t σ4 t XT−t  2 2 ]    (i) + E [−λ2 t(2 −σ2 t) σ6 t Ct(XT−t)XT−t + λ3 t σ6 t vt(XT−t)  2 2 ]    (ii) . We shall bound terms(i) and (ii) in Eq. (37) separately in the sequel. Let us start with term(i), for which we observe that −λt(2 −σ2 t) σ4 t m(t,XT−t) + 2λ2 t σ4 t XT−t = −λt σ2 t m(t,XT−t) + 2λ2 t σ3 t E [ g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] . (38) By Jensen’s inequality, we have E [ ∥m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 ] ≤E [ ∥θ∥2 2 ] ≤d, E [ ∥E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t]∥2 2 ] ≤E [ ∥g∥2 2 ] = d, (39) where (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Substituting Eqs. (38) and (39) into term(i), we arrive at (i) ≲ λ2 td σ4 t + λ4 td σ6 t . (40) Next, we turn attention to term(ii). To this end, writeXT−t = λtΘ + σtG, where(Θ,G) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Note that −λ2 t(2 −σ2 t) σ6 t Ct(XT−t)XT−t + λ3 t σ6 t vt(XT−t) = −λ2 t + λ4 t σ5 t Ct(XT−t)G+ λ3 t σ6 t E [( θ−m(t,XT−t) )( θ−m(t,XT−t) )⊤ θ|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] −λ3 t σ6 t Ct(XT−t) ( Θ −m(t,XT−t) ) −λ5 t σ6 t Ct(XT−t)Θ = −λ2 t + λ4 t σ5 t Ct(XT−t)G+ λ3 t σ6 t E [( θ−m(t,XT−t) )θ−m(t,XT−t) 2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] −λ3 t + λ5 t σ6 t Ct(XT−t) ( Θ −m(t,XT−t) ) + λ3 t σ4 t Ct(XT−t)m(t,XT−t). (41) We then separately upper bound the terms in the lase line of Eq. (41). To this end, we find the following expressions useful (recall thatXT−t = λtΘ + σtG for (Θ,G) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,1)): Ct(XT−t) = σ2 t λ2 t E [( g−E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] )( g−E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] )⊤ |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] , E [( θ−m(t,XT−t) )θ−m(t,XT−t) 2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] = −σ3 t λ3 t E [( g−E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] )g−E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] 2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ] , Θ −mt(XT−t) = −σt λt ( G−E[g|λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] ) . (42) 21• Let us look at the first summand in the last line of Eq. (41), namely, the term−σ−5 t (λ2 t+λ4 t)Ct(XT−t)G. In view of Eq. (42), we can deduce that E [Ct(XT−t)G 2 2 ](a) ≤E [Ct(XT−t) 4 F ]1/2 E [G 4 2 ]1/2 (b) ≲ σ4 td3 λ4 t , (43) where step(a) is by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and step(b) arises from the Jensen inequality. Using Eq. (43), we see that (λ2 t + λ4 t)2 σ10 t E [Ct(XT−t)G 2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ6 t . (44) • Regarding the second summand in Eq. (41), note thatλ3 tσ−6 t E[(θ−m(t,XT−t))∥θ−m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 | λtθ+ σtg= XT−t]. Applying Eq. (42), the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and Jensen’s inequality yields E [E [ (θ−m(t,XT−t))∥θ−m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t ]2 2 ] ≤E [ E[∥θ−m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] ·E[∥θ−m(t,XT−t)∥4 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t] ] ≤E [ ∥Θ −m(t,XT−t)∥4 2 ]1/2 ·E [ ∥Θ −m(t,XT−t)∥8 2 ]1/2 ≲ σ6 td3 λ6 t , which further implies that λ6 t σ12 t E [ ∥E[(θ−m(t,XT−t))∥θ−m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 |λtθ+ σtg= XT−t]∥2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ6 t . (45) • The remaining two terms in Eq. (41) can be controlled in a similar manner. The proof idea is similar to that for the first two terms, and we skip a detailed explanation for the compactness of presentation. Specifically, we obtain the following upper bounds: (λ3 t + λ5 t)2 σ12 t E [ ∥Ct(XT−t)(Θ −m(t,XT−t))∥2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ6 t , (46) λ6 t σ8 t E [ ∥Ct(XT−t)m(t,XT−t)∥2 2 ] ≲ λ2 td3 σ4 t . (47) Finally, we put together Eqs. (44) to (47). Invoking Eq. (41), we can then conclude that (ii) ≲ d3 σ6 t . (48) To finish up, combine Eqs. (40) and (48) to obtain E [∂t∇xlog qt(XT−t) 2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ6 t , thus concluding the proof. C Bounding the KL divergence between diffusion processes C.1 Proof of Lemma 4.1 First, we show that for anyτ ∈(0,tk+1 −tk), there exists a unique strong solution to the SDE(29) on the interval [tk + τ,tk+1]. To this end, we shall introduce an augmented process, and show that(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t is a subset of this process. Let us begin by determining the drift function of this process and proving its Lipschitz 22continuity. Recall thatFis defined as the drift functional of process(25a). For allt∈(tk,tk+1], observe that we can write F ( t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t ) = Gt ( Ytk,Hτ t , ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdHτ tk+r, ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rHτ tk+rdr ) . for some continuous mappingGt : R4d →Rd. By the first point of Lemma B.2, we see that under Assumption A, for allt∈[0,T) the mappingx↦→s(t,x) is Lipschitz continuous. As a consequence, for anyτ ∈(0,tk+1 −tk) and allt∈[tk + τ,tk+1], Gt is Cτ-Lipschitz continuous for someCτ ∈(0,∞) that depends only onτ. We then introduce an augmented processLt = (L1,t,L2,t,L3,t,L4,t) ∈R4d, defined as the solution to the following SDE: dLt =   L1,t + 2s(t,L1,t)( L1,t + 2s(t,L1,t) −Gt(L1,t,L2,t,L3,t,L4,t) ) / √ 2 L3,t + ( L1,t + 2s(t,L1,t) −Gt(L1,t,L2,t,L3,t,L4,t) ) / √ 2 L2,t + L4,t  dt+   √ 2dBt dBt dBt 0d   = b(t,Lt)dt+ σ(t,Lt)dBt. (49) Here, b(t,L) ∈R4d and σ(t,L) ∈R4d×d. Since Gt is Cτ-Lipschitz continuous for allt ∈[tk + τ,tk+1], we obtain that the mappingsL ↦→b(t,L) and L ↦→σ(t,L) are Lipschitz continuous with a uniformly upper bounded Lipschitz constant for allt∈[tk + τ,tk+1]. By Le Gall (2016, Theorem 8.3), SDE(49) has a unique strong solution, regardless of the initialization. This establishes the existence and uniqueness of process (Hτ t )tk≤t≤tk+1 as a solution to (29). In what follows, denote by Qk(y) the law of (Yt)tk≤t≤tk+1, and Qk(y) the law of (At(Ytk))tk≤t≤tk+1, conditioned onYtk = y, where At(y) := et−tky+ (et−tk −e−t+tk)s(tk,y + gtk,t) + √ 2 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rdWtk+r. In the above display, we recall that(Wt)t≥0 represents ad-dimensional standard Brownian motion, andgtk,t is defined in Eq. (10b). Using the decomposition of KL divergence, we obtain KL ( QT−δ ∥QT−δ ) = K−1∑ k=0 EQT−δ [ KL ( Qk(Ytk) ∥Qk(Ytk) )] , where the expectation is taken with respect to(Yt)0≤t≤T−δ ∼QT−δ. Forτ ∈(0,tk+1 −tk), we define the process(Uτ t )tk≤t≤tk+1 with Uτ tk = Ytk, and dUτ t = ( Uτ t + 2s(t,Uτ t ) ) dt+ √ 2dWt, for tk ≤t≤tk + τ, dUτ t = F ( t,Ytk,(Ws −Wtk)tk≤s≤t ) dt+ √ 2 dWt, for tk + τ ≤t≤tk+1. As τ →0+, it holds thatsuptk≤t≤tk+1 ∥Uτ t −At(Ytk)∥2 a.s. →0. Denote byQ τ k(Ytk) the conditional distribution of (Uτ t )tk≤t≤tk+1 given Uτ tk = Ytk. Therefore, for allYtk ∈Rd the distributionQ τ k(Ytk) converges weakly to Qk(Ytk). Invoking the same Girsanov-type arguments as in Chen et al. (2023c, Section 5.2), we see that KL ( Qk(Ytk) ∥Q τ k(Ytk) ) = ∫tk+1 tk+τ E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ⏐⏐Ytk ] dt. (50) Leveraging the lower semicontinuity of KL divergence, we obtain EQT−δ [ KL ( Qk(Ytk) ∥Qk(Ytk) )] ≤EQT−δ [ lim inf τ→0+ KL ( Qk(Ytk) ∥Q τ k(Ytk) )] ≤lim inf τ→0+ EQT−δ [ KL ( Qk(Ytk) ∥Q τ k(Ytk) )] 23= lim inf τ→0+ ∫tk+1 tk+τ E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ⏐⏐Ytk ] dt, where the second inequality above follows from Fatou’s Lemma, and the last equality arises from Eq. (50). This completes the proof. C.2 Proof of Lemma 4.2 By virtue of Eq. (29), for allt∈[tk + τ,tk+1] we have Hτ t −Hτ tk = Bt −Btk + va,t + vb,t + vc,t + vd,t + ve,t + vf,t, (51) where the residual termsva,t,vb,t,vc,t,vd,t,ve,t,vf,t ∈Rd are defined respectively as follows: va,t = 1√ 2 ∫t tk+τ (eζ−tk −e−ζ+tk)s(tk,Ytk)dζ, vb,t = ∫t tk+τ ∫ζ−tk 0 eζ−tk−r(dBtk+r −dHτ tk+r)dζ, vc,t = − 1√ 2 ∫t tk+τ (eζ−tk + e−ζ+tk) ( s(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ) −s(tk,Ytk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)htk,ζ ) dζ, vd,t = √ 2 ∫t tk+τ ∫ζ−tk 0 eζ−tk−r( s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) ) drdζ, ve,t = −2 ∫t tk+τ ∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ) ∫ζ−tk 0 eζ−tk−rHτ tk+rdrdζ, vf,t = √ 2 ∫t tk+τ ( s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)Hτ ζ ) dζ, In the above display, we let htk,ζ = 2 √ 2 eζ−tk −e−ζ+tk ∫ζ−tk 0 eζ−tk−rHτ tk+rdr, which essentially replacesWtk+r −Wtk with Hτ tk+r in the definition ofgtk,ζ. Before proceeding to bounding the terms in Eq.(51), we find it helpful to first make some observations. Fort∈[tk,tk+1], defineγtk,t = ∥Hτ t −Bt+ Btk∥2, which clearly obeysγtk,tk = 0. In view of the first point of Lemma B.2 and Assumption A, we see that ∇xs(t,x)  2 ≤4 ( σ−2 T−t + λ2 T−tσ−4 T−t ) d for allx∈Rd and t∈[0,T). Similarly, by the second point of Lemma B.2, we can deduce that ∇2 xs(t,x)  2 ≤8λ3 T−tσ−6 T−td3/2 for allx∈Rd and t∈[0,T). Next, we adopt these upper bounds to analyze the terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (51). We first look at vc,t. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have s(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ) −s(tk,Ytk) = ∫1 0 ∇xs(tk,Ytk + ηhtk,ζ)htk,ζdη. Using this decomposition and the triangle inequality, we obtain that s(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ) −s(tk,Ytk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)htk,ζ  2 24≤ ∫1 0 ∥∇xs(tk,Ytk + ηhtk,ζ)∥2∥htk,ζ∥2dη ≤8(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)d∥htk,ζ∥2. Recall that under Assumption B, we have∆k ≤κ ≤1/4. Therefore, for allζ ∈[tk,tk+1], it holds that eζ−tk + e−ζ+tk <2.1, and as a consequence, ∥vc,t∥2 ≤12 ∫t tk+τ (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)d∥htk,ζ∥2dζ ≤ ∫t tk+τ 34(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)d eζ−tk −e−ζ+tk [∫ζ−tk 0 eζ−tk−r( ∥Btk+r −Btk∥2 + γtk,tk+r ) dr ] dζ. (52) We then proceed to upper bound the norms ofva,t and vd,t. More specifically, ∥va,t∥2 ≤ 1√ 2(et−tk + e−t+tk −2) s(tk,Ytk)  2 ≤(t−tk)2 4 s(tk,Ytk)  2, (53) ∥vd,t∥2 ≤2(t−tk) ∫t−tk 0 s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk)  2dr. (54) With regards tove,t, it follows from the triangle inequality and the assumption∆k ≤κ≤1/4 that ∥ve,t∥2 ≤10(t−tk)d ( σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk )∫t−tk 0 (γtk,tk+r + ∥Btk+r −Btk∥2)dr. (55) To bound the norm ofvf,t, we find it helpful to bound the norm of the vectors(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Yζ), towards which we resort to the third point of Lemma B.2. More precisely, for allr ∈[tk,ζ], the third point of Lemma B.2 tells us that ∂rs(r,Yζ) = λT−r + λ3 T−r σ4 T−r m(r,Yζ) −2λ2 T−r σ4 T−r Yζ −λT−r σ2 T−r E [( θ−m(r,Yζ) ) F(θ,Yζ,r) |λT−rθ+ σT−rg= Yζ ] , where (θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id), andm(r,y) = E[θ |λT−rθ+ σT−rg = y]. Under Assumption A, it holds that ∥m(r,Yζ)∥2 ≤ √ d and |F(θ,Yζ,r)|≤ λ2 T−rσ−4 T−rd+ (λT−r + λ3 T−r)σ−4 T−r √ d∥Yζ∥2. Since s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Yζ) = ∫ζ tk ∂rs(r,Yζ)dr, we see that for allζ ∈[tk,tk+1], s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Yζ)  2 ≤ √ d(ζ−tk)(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ) σ4 T−ζ + 2(ζ−tk)λ2 T−ζ∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ + (dλ2 T−ζ σ4 T−ζ + √ d(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ)∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ ) · ∫ζ tk λT−rE[∥θ−m(r,Yζ)∥2 |λT−rθ+ σT−rg= Yζ] σ2 T−r dr. (56) Further, we make the observation that ∥s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)Hτ ζ∥2 (i) ≤∥s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Yζ)∥2 + ∥s(tk,Yζ) −s(tk,Ytk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)(Yζ −Ytk)∥2 + ∥∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)(Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk)∥2 + ∥ √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk + htk,ζ)(Bζ −Btk −Hτ ζ)∥2 (ii) ≤ ∥s(ζ,Yζ) −s(tk,Yζ)∥2 + 8d(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)∥Yζ −Ytk∥2 + 4d(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)∥Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk∥2 + 6d(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)γtk,ζ. (57) 25In the above display,(i) comes from the triangle inequality, whereas(ii) is by the first point of Lemma B.2 and Assumption A. Substituting the upper bounds in Eqs. (56) and (57) into the definition ofvf,t yields ∥vf,t∥2 ≤ √ 2 ∫t tk+τ (√ d(ζ−tk)(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ) σ4 T−ζ + 2(ζ−tk)λ2 T−ζ∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ ) dζ ≤ √ 2 ∫t tk+τ (dλ2 T−ζ σ4 T−ζ + √ d(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ)∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ ) · ∫ζ tk λT−rE[∥θ−m(r,Yζ)∥2 |λT−rθ+ σT−rg= Yζ] σ2 T−r drdζ + d ( σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk )∫t tk+τ (9γtk,ζ + 6∥Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk∥2 + 12∥Yζ −Ytk∥2)dζ. (58) The next step is to upper bound the norm ofvb,t, towards which we first make note of the following expression vb,t = ∫t tk+τ ∫ζ−tk 0 ∫eζ−tk−r 0 dx(dBtk+r −dHτ tk+r)dζ = ∫t tk+τ ∫ζ−tk 0 ∫eζ−tk 0 1 {r≤ζ−tk −log x}dx(dBtk+r −dHτ tk+r)dζ = ∫t tk+τ ∫eζ−tk 0 (Bζ−log x −Btk −Hτ ζ−log x)dxdζ. As a consequence, we have ∥vb,t∥2 ≤ ∫t tk+τ ∫eζ−tk 0 γtk,ζ−log xdxdζ. (59) Finally, we can conclude the proof of the lemma using the upper bounds derived above. Fort∈[tk,tk+1], we define γ∗(t) = sup s∈[tk,t] γtk,s. We see that att= tk we haveγ∗(tk) = 0, and our goal is to upper boundγ∗(tk+1). In addition, since the processes (Bt −Btk)tk≤t≤tk+1 and (Hτ t )tk≤t≤tk+1 have continuous sample paths, the mappingt↦→γ∗(t) is continuous ont∈[tk,tk+1]. Substitution of Eqs. (52) to (55), (58) and (59) into Eq. (51) gives γ∗(t) ≤C0 + C1γ∗(t), (60) where C0,C1 ∈R>0 are defined as follows: C0 = (t−tk)2 4 ∥s(tk,Ytk)∥2 + ∫t tk+τ 44(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)d eζ−tk −e−ζ+tk ∫ζ−tk 0 ∥Btk+r −Btk∥2drdζ + 2(t−tk) ∫t−tk 0 s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk)  2dr+ 10(t−tk)d(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk) ∫t−tk 0 ∥Btk+r −Btk∥2dr + 2 √ 2 ∫t tk+τ (dλ2 T−ζ σ4 T−ζ + √ d(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ)∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ ) · ∫ζ tk λT−r √ d σ2 T−r drdζ + √ 2 ∫t tk+τ (√ d(ζ−tk)(λT−ζ + λ3 T−ζ) σ4 T−ζ + 2(ζ−tk)λ2 T−ζ∥Yζ∥2 σ4 T−ζ ) dζ + d(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk) ∫t tk+τ (6∥Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk∥2 + 12∥Yζ −Ytk∥2)dζ, C1 = 1.3(t−tk) + (53(t−tk) + 10(t−tk)2)(σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)d. 26Under Assumption B, we know thatC1 ≤1/2 for all t ∈[tk,tk+1], and hence γ∗(t) ≤2C0. Invoking Lemma A.3 tells us that: for allζ ∈[tk,tk+1] we have E [ ∥Yζ −Ytk∥2 2 ] ≲ d(ζ−tk) + dσ−2 T−ζ(ζ−tk)2, E [ ∥Yζ∥2 2 ] ≲ d, E [ ∥Bζ −Btk∥2 2 ] ≲ d(ζ−tk), E [ ∥s(ζ,Yζ)∥2 2 ] ≲ dσ−2 T−ζ, E [ ∥Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk∥2 2 ] ≲ dσ−2 T−ζ(ζ−tk)2, E [ ∥Yζ −Ytk∥4 2 ] ≲ d2(ζ−tk)2 + d2σ−4 T−ζ(ζ−tk)4, E [ ∥Yζ∥4 2 ] ≲ d2, E [ ∥Bζ −Btk∥4 2 ] ≲ d2(ζ−tk)2, E [ ∥s(ζ,Yζ)∥2 2 ] ≲ d2σ−4 T−ζ, E [ ∥Yζ −Ytk − √ 2Bζ + √ 2Btk∥2 2 ] ≲ d2σ−4 T−ζ(ζ−tk)4. Taking the expectation ofC2 0 and C4 0 implies that for allt∈[tk,tk+1], E[γ∗(t)2] ≲ σ−2 T−t(t−tk)4d+ (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)2(t−tk)3d3 + λ4 T−tσ−12 T−t(t−tk)4d3 + λ2 T−tσ−8 T−t(t−tk)4d, E[γ∗(t)4] ≲ σ−4 T−t(t−tk)8d2 + (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)4(t−tk)6d6 + λ8 T−tσ−24 T−t(t−tk)8d6 + λ4 T−tσ−16 T−t(t−tk)8d2. The proof is thus complete. C.3 Proof of Lemma 4.3 According to Lemma 4.1, we see that: in order to upper boundKL(QT−δ ∥QT−δ), it suffices to control K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt. In view of Lemma B.2 and Assumption A, we know that for allt∈[0,T) and x∈Rd, it holds that ∥∇xs(t,x)∥2 ≲ (σ−2 T−t + λ2 T−tσ−4 T−t)d, ∥∇2 xs(t,x)∥2 ≲ λ3 T−tσ−6 T−td3/2, which in turn allow one to show thatFis Lipschitz continuous with respect to the last input. More precisely, F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) −F(t,Ytk,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t)  2 ≲ ∥∇xs ( tk,Ytk + htk,t ) ∥2∥Bt −Btk −Hτ t ∥2 + ∥∇xs ( tk,Ytk + htk,t ) −∇xs ( tk,Ytk + btk,t ) ∥2 ·∥Bt −Btk∥2 + ∥∇xs ( tk,Ytk + htk,t ) ∥2∥htk,t −btk,t∥2 + ∥∇xs ( tk,Ytk + htk,t ) −∇xs ( tk,Ytk + btk,t ) ∥2 ·∥btk,t∥2 ≲ ( d(σ−2 T−t + λ2 T−tσ−4 T−t) + d3/2λ3 T−tσ−6 T−t(∥Bt −Btk∥2 + ∥btk,t∥2) ) sup tk≤t≤tk+1 Bt −Btk −Hτ t  2, with btk,t = 2 √ 2(et−tk −e−t+tk)−1 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−r(Btk+r −Btk)dr, htk,t = 2 √ 2(et−tk −e−t+tk)−1 ∫t−tk 0 et−tk−rHτ tk+rdr. Putting the above inequality together with Lemma 4.2 gives K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt + K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Ytk,(Hτ s)tk≤s≤t) −F(t,Ytk,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt 27+ K−1∑ k=0 ∆k ( d2(σ−2 T−t + λ2 T−tσ−4 T−t)2 + d3λ6 T−tσ−12 T−t∆k ) × ( σ−2 T−tk+1∆4 kd+ (σ−2 T−tk + λ2 T−tkσ−4 T−tk)2∆3 kd3 + λ4 T−tk+1σ−12 T−tk+1∆4 kd3 + λ2 T−tk+1σ−8 T−tk+1∆4 kd ) . It is seen from the triangle inequality that K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [F(t,Yt) −F(t,Ytk,(Bs −Btk)tk≤s≤t) 2 2 ] dt≲ T1 + T2 + T3 + T4, where T1 = K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk (et−tk −e−t+tk)2E [ ∥s(tk,Ytk)∥2 2 ] dt, T2 = K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [s(t,Yt) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Bt −Btk) 2 2 ] dt, T3 = K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk ∫t−tk 0 E [ ∥s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Btk+r −Btk)∥2 2 ] drdt, T4 = K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [ ∥s(tk,Ytk + btk,t) −s(tk,Ytk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)btk,t∥2 2 ] dt. The termsT1, T2, T3 and T4 are upper bounded separately in Lemma C.1 below, whose proof can be found in Appendix C.5. Lemma C.1. Under the assumptions of Lemma 4.3, it holds that 1. T1 ≲ ∑K−1 k=0 σ−2 T−tk∆3 kd; 2. T2 ≲ ∑K−1 k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) ; 3. T3 ≲ ∑K−1 k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆4 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆5 k ) ; 4. T4 ≲ ∑K−1 k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) . As a consequence of Lemma C.1, we reach KL(QT−δ ∥QT−δ) ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) . Let K0 = inf{k : T −tk ≤1}, look at the indices that are above and belowK0 separately. Specifically, for allk ≤K0 −1 we haveσ−2 T−tk ≲ 1. In addition, for allK−1 ≥k ≥K0 we haveσ−2 T−tk ≲ (T −tk)−1, and hence under Assumption B we haved3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ≲ d3κ2∆k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−4 T−tkκ3∆k. Putting these together yields K−1∑ k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) = K0−1∑ k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) + K−1∑ k=K0 ( d3κ2∆k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−4 T−tkκ3∆k ) ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T), as claimed in the lemma. 28C.4 Proof of Lemma 4.4 Denoting byQ dis T−δ the distribution of(Ytk)0≤k≤K, we observe that KL(Qdis T−δ ∥ˆQdis T−δ) = ∫ dQdis T−δlog dQdis T−δ dQ dis T−δ   (i) + ∫ dQdis T−δlog dQ dis T−δ d ˆQdis T−δ   (ii) , (61) leaving us with two terms to control. Bounding the term (i) Note that the term (i) is essentially(i) = KL(Qdis T−δ ∥Q dis T−δ). Recall that the data processing inequality (Polyanskiy, 2020, Theorem 7.2) asserts thatKL ( Pf(X) ∥Pf(Y) ) ≤KL(PX ∥PY) holds for any two random objects X and Y on the same space and any mappingf, withPZ the distribution ofZ. Taking this together with Lemma 4.3, we reach ∫ dQdis T−δlog dQdis T−δ dQ dis T−δ ≤ ∫ dQT−δlog dQT−δ dQT−δ ≲ d3κ2T + d7κ3(δ−1 + T). Bounding the term (ii) Recall that ˆQT−δ is the distribution of process(10a) and QT−δ is that of process(21). By Eq. (10a) and Eq. (21), we see that for eachk∈{0,1,...,K −1}, Ytk+1 = e∆kYtk + (e∆k −e−∆k)s(tk,Ytk + gtk,tk+1) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r, ˆYtk+1 = e∆kˆYtk + (e∆k −e−∆k)ˆs(tk,ˆYtk + gtk,tk+1) + √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r, (62) where we recall thatgtk,tk+1 is defined in Eq. (10b). Note thatgtk,tk+1 and √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r are correlated Gaussian random vectors, which admit simpler expressions. Specifically, from Lemma A.1, we can write gtk,tk+1 = ζk,1gk,1, √ 2 ∫∆k 0 e∆k−rdWtk+r = ζk,2gk,1 + ζk,3gk,2, (63) where gk,1,gk,2 i.i.d. ∼ N(0,Id), and ζk,1 = 2 √ 2f1(∆k)1/2 e∆k −e−∆k , ζ k,2 = √ 2f3(∆k) f1(∆k)1/2 , ζ k,3 = √ 2f2(∆k) −2f3(∆k)2 f1(∆k) . (64) In the above display, we recall the definitions off1,f2 and f3 in Eq. (32). For every 0 ≤ k ≤ K, denote by Qk the distribution of (Yt0,Yt1,··· ,Ytk), Qk the distribution of (Yt0,Yt1,··· ,Ytk), and ˆQk that of(ˆYt0,ˆYt1,··· ,ˆYtk). Therefore, it follows from Eq. (62) that ∫ dQdis T−δlog dQ dis T−δ d ˆQdis T−δ = K−1∑ k=0 ∫ dQk+1 log dQk+1(Ytk+1 |Yt0,··· ,Ytk) d ˆQk+1(Ytk+1 |Yt0,··· ,Ytk) = K−1∑ k=0 ∫ dQk+1 log ∫ exp ( −∥Ytk+1 −e∆kYtk −(e∆k −e−∆k)s(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g) −ζk,2g∥2 2/(2ζ2 k,3) ) ϕ(g)dg∫ exp ( −∥Ytk+1 −e∆kYtk −(e∆k −e−∆k)ˆs(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g) −ζk,2g∥2 2/(2ζ2 k,3) ) ϕ(g)dg, 29whereϕ(·) denotes the probability density function ofN(0,Id). Recalling thats(t,x) = σ−2 T−t(−x+λT−tm(t,x)) and ˆs(t,x) = σ−2 T−t(−x+ λT−tˆm(t,x)) (with mand ˆmintroduced in Remark 3.3), we can further deduce that ∫ dQdis T−δlog dQ dis T−δ d ˆQdis T−δ (65) = K−1∑ k=0 ∫ dQk+1 log ∫ exp ( ηk⟨m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg∫ exp ( ηk⟨ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, where ϕξ,τ(·) denotes the probability density function forN(ξ,τ 2Id), and we set ηk = ζ−2 k,3σ−2 T−tkλT−tk(e∆k −e−∆k), vk = Ytk+1 + ( σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) −e∆k ) Ytk, κk = ζk,2 −σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k)ζk,1, γk = ζ−2 k,3σ−4 T−tkλ2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k)2, τ2 k = (ζ2 k,3 + κ2 k)−1ζ2 k,3, ξk = ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκkvk. (66) We find it helpful to single out the following useful upper bounds (the proofs are omitted as they follow from straightforward calculus techniques): ηk ≲ σ−2 T−tkλT−tk, |κk|≲ ∆1/2 k , γ k ≲ κλ2 T−tk, τ 2 k ≲ 1. (67) In addition, it can be verified that: ifg∼N(ξk,τ2 kId), then one can write Ytk + ζk,1g= Ytk + ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk ( Ytk+1 −e∆kYtk + σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k)Ytk ) + ζk,1τkg′, (68) where g′∼N(0,Id) is independent of(Ytk,Ytk+1). Now let us analyze the quantitiesζk,1,ζk,2,ζk,3 and those defined in Eq. (66) in the lemma below. Lemma C.2. Under the assumptions of Lemma 4.4, it holds that |ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk|≤ 0.65, σ−2 T−tk ( 1 −e−2∆k ) ≤3.2 √ ∆kκ, σ−2 T−tk ( e∆k −e−∆k ) ≤3.25 √ ∆kκ. Proof of Lemma C.2.Recall that by Assumption B we have∆k ≤κ <1/4. As a consequence, we have 1 −e−2∆k ≤2∆k and e∆k −e−∆k ≤81∆k/40. If T −tk ≥ 1/2, then σ−2 T−tk ≤ (1 −e−1)−1. In this case, we haveσ−2 T−tk(1 −e−2∆k) ≤ 3.2∆k, and σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) ≤3.25∆k. On the other hand, ifT −tk < 1/2, then σ−2 T−tk ≤0.8(T −tk)−1, hence σ−2 T−tk(1 −e−2∆k) ≤1.6∆k/(T −tk) ≤1.6√κ∆k and σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) ≤1.62∆k/(T −tk) ≤1.62√κ∆k. This establishes the second and the third inequalities. As for the first inequality, observe that|ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk|= |ζk,1κk/(ζ2 k,3 + κ2 k)|≤| ζk,1ζ−1 k,3|/2. When∆k ≤1/4, it holds thatζk,1 ∈[0.8∆1/2 k ,0.9∆1/2 k ] and ζk,3 ∈[0.7∆1/2 k ,0.75∆1/2 k ]. Therefore, we have|ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk|≤ |ζk,1ζ−1 k,3|/2 ≤0.65. Denoting by νk the marginal distribution of the random vector in Eq. (68), we provide an important property aboutνk in the next lemma. 30Lemma C.3. Under the assumptions of Lemma 4.4, it holds thatνk d = akYtk+1 + bkg, where ak,bk are quantities satisfying|ak −1|≤ 3.1√∆kκ and |bk|≤ 3.5√∆k. Here,g∼N(0,Id) is independent ofYtk+1, and we recall thatYtk+1 ∼qT−tk+1. Proof of Lemma C.3.Note that we can writeYtk = e−∆kYtk+1 + √ 1 −e−2∆kG, where G ∼ N(0,Id) is independent ofYtk+1. Substituting this equation into Eq. (68) yields νk d = ( e−∆k + σ−2 T−tk(1 −e−2∆k)ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk ) Ytk+1 + ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk √ 1 −e−2∆k ( σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) −e∆k ) G + √ 1 −e−2∆kG+ ζk,1τkg′ d = akYtk+1 + bkG, where ak = e−∆k + σ−2 T−tk(1 −e−2∆k)ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk, bk = √ ζ2 k,1τ2 k + (1 −e−2∆k) ( ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk(σ−2 T−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) −e∆k) + 1 )2 . Note that|1 −e−2∆k|≤ 2∆k ≤2κ and τ2 k ≤1. Using these upper bounds and Lemma C.2, we reach |ak −1|≤| e−∆k −1|+ σ−2 T−tk(1 −e−2∆k)|ζk,1ζ−2 k,3τ2 kκk|≤ 3.1 √ ∆kκ |bk|≤ √ 0.92∆k + 2∆k ( 1 + 0.65 ×(e1/4 + 3.25κ) )2 ≤3.5∆1/2 k as claimed. By virtue of Assumption C and Lemma C.3, we know that Ey∼νk [ ∥m(tk,y) −ˆm(tk,y)∥2 2 ] = σ4 T−tkλ−2 T−tkEy∼νk [ ∥s(tk,y) −ˆs(tk,y)∥2 2 ] ≤σ4 T−tkλ−2 T−tkε2 score,k. In the sequel, we make the convention that conditional on(Ytk,Ytk+1), g∼N(ξk,τ2 kId), where we recall that (ξk,τ2 k) are defined in Eq. (66). Note thatξk is a function of(Ytk,Ytk+1). Foryk,yk+1 ∈Rd, we define pk(yk,yk+1) = P ( ∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g) −ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 ≥σT−tkλ−1/2 T−tkε1/2 score,k |Ytk = yk,Ytk+1 = yk+1 ) . Then by Chebyshev’s inequality, one has E[pk(Ytk,Ytk+1)] ≤σ2 T−tkλ−1 T−tkεscore,k. Conditioning on(Ytk,Ytk+1), we introduce the conditional event SYtk,Ytk+1 = { g: ∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g) −ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 ≥σT−tkλ−1/2 T−tkε1/2 score,k } . Per the discussions above, we see thatP(Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 ) ≤pk(Ytk,Ytk+1). For notational simplicity, we define Nk := ∫ 1 {g∈SYtk,Ytk+1 }exp ( ηk⟨m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, ˆNk := ∫ 1 {g∈SYtk,Ytk+1 }exp ( ηk⟨ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, Nc k := ∫ 1 {g∈Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 }exp ( ηk⟨m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, ˆNc k := ∫ 1 {g∈Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 }exp ( ηk⟨ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, ˆDk := ∫ exp ( ηk⟨ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg, 31which clearly obeyˆD−1 k ( ˆNk + ˆNc k) = 1, and log ∫ exp ( ηk⟨m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥m(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg∫ exp ( ηk⟨ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g),vk −κkg⟩−γk∥ˆm(tk,Ytk + ζk,1g)∥2 2/2 ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg = log Nk + Nc k ˆDk . Hence, in order to upper bound term(ii) (cf. Eq. (61)), it suffices to upper boundˆD−1 k (Nk + Nc k), towards which we intend to upper boundˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk|and ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k|separately. Let us start with the first termˆD−1 k |Nk−ˆNk|. Note that fora1,a2 ∈R, we have|ea−eb|≤ emax{a,b}|a−b|. As a consequence, wheng falls insideSYtk,tk+1 , we have ˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk| (69) ≤ ε1/2 score,kσT−tk ˆDkλ1/2 T−tk ∫ e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥g−ξk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)(ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + ηkκk∥g−ξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2)ϕξk,τk(g)dg. Note that ∫ e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥g−ξk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)(ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + ηkκk∥g−ξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2)ϕξk,τk(g)dg ≤ ∫ e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)+4ηkκkd+ηkκk∥g−ξk∥2 2/4(ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + ηkκk∥g−ξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2)ϕξk,τk(g)dg ≤e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)+4ηkκkd (1 −τ2 kηkκk/2)d/2 ( ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2 + ηkκk ( dτ2 k 1 −τ2 kηkκk/2 )1/2) . (70) Note that the validity of Eq. (70) is conditional onηkκkτ2 k < 2: Only under this condition can we apply Gaussian integral to derive the last upper bound. We verify this condition in the next lemma. Lemma C.4. Under the assumptions of Lemma 4.4, it holds that1 −ηkκkτ2 k/2 ≥0.4 for all 0 ≤k≤K−1. Proof of Lemma C.4.Note that ηkκkτ2 k = κkλT−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) σ2 T−tk(ζ2 k,3 + κ2 k) . Inspecting the proof of Lemma C.2, we see that: under the current assumptions, we haveσ−2 T−tk(e∆k−e−∆k) ≤ 3.25√∆kκ, ζk,1 ∈[0.8∆1/2 k ,0.9∆1/2 k ] and ζk,3 ∈[0.7∆1/2 k ,0.75∆1/2 k ]. As a consequence, one has ⏐⏐⏐κkλT−tk(e∆k −e−∆k) σ2 T−tk(ζ2 k,3 + κ2 k) ⏐⏐⏐≤ ⏐⏐⏐(e∆k −e−∆k) 2σ2 T−tkζk,3 ⏐⏐⏐≤2.4√κ, which is no larger than1.2 when κ< 1/4. Note that under Assumption C, the quantityˆDk admits the following lower bound: ˆDk ≥ ∫ exp ( −2ηk √ d∥vk∥2 −2ηkκk √ d∥g−ξk∥2 −2ηkκk √ d∥ξk∥2 −2γkd ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg ≥exp ( −2ηk √ d∥vk∥2 −ηkκkd−2ηkκk √ d∥ξk∥2 −2γkd ) /(1 + τ2 kηkκk)d (71) ≳ exp ( −2ηk √ d∥vk∥2 −ηkκkd−2ηkκk √ d∥ξk∥2 −2γkd ) , where the last inequality is due to the upper bound(1 + τ2 kηkκk)d ≤exp(dτ2 kηkκk), which by the proof of Lemma C.4 is no larger thanexp(2.4√κd) ≲ 1. Here, we utilize the assumption thatκd2 ≲ 1. Again by inspecting the proof of Lemma C.4, we see that(1 −τ2 kηkκk/2)d/2 ≥(1 −1.2√κ)d/2 ≥exp(−√κd), which by 32Assumption B is lower bounded by a positive numerical constant. Using this lower bound, we arrive at the following conclusion: The last line of Eq. (70) ≲ e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)+4ηkκkd ( ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2 + ηkκkτkd1/2 ) . (72) Putting together Eqs. (70) to (72) and using Eq. (67), we have ˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk| ≲ ε1/2 score,kσT−tk λ1/2 T−tk e4ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)+5ηkκkd+2γkd ( ηk∥vk∥2 + ηk∥κkξk∥2 + 3γk √ d/2 + ηkκkτkd1/2 ) . Taking the expectation overQk+1 leads to EQk+1 [ˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk| ] ≲ ε1/2 score,kσT−tk λ1/2 T−tk exp(d√κ)κ1/2d1/2 ≲ ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd1/2 λ1/2 T−tk . (73) We then move on to controlEQk+1 [ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k| ] . Once again using the fact that for anya1,a2 ∈R, we have |ea −eb|≤ emax{a,b}|a−b|. As a result, ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k| ≤ˆD−1 k ∫ 1 {g∈Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 }e2ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥g−ξk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)( 3ηk √ d(∥vk∥2 + κk∥g∥2) + 2γkd ) ϕξk,τk(g)dg ≤ˆD−1 k P ( Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 )1/2(∫ e4ηk √ d(∥vk∥2+κk∥g−ξk∥2+κk∥ξk∥2)( 3ηk √ d(∥vk∥2 + κk∥g∥2) + 2γkd )2 ϕξk,τk(g)dg )1/2 , where the last inequality above arises from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Recall thatP(Sc Ytk,Ytk+1 ) ≤ pk(Ytk,Ytk+1), which satisfiesE[pk(Ytk,Ytk+1)] ≤σ2 T−tkλ−1 T−tkεscore,k. Taking the expectation overQk+1 gives EQk+1 [ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k| ] ≲ ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd λ1/2 T−tk . (74) Finally, put together Eqs. (73) and (74) to demonstrate that (ii) = EQk+1 [ log (ˆD−1 k (Nk + Nc k) )] ≤EQk+1 [ log ( 1 + ˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk|+ ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k| )] ≤EQk+1 [ˆD−1 k |Nk −ˆNk| ] + EQk+1 [ˆD−1 k |Nc k −ˆNc k| ] ≲ ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd λ1/2 T−tk , thus concluding the proof. C.5 Proof of Lemma C.1 Proof of the first point To prove the first point, we note that by Eq. (33), T1 = K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk (et−tk −e−t+tk)2E [ ∥s(tk,Ytk)∥2 2 ] dt 33≲ K−1∑ k=0 ∆3 kσ−2 T−tkE [ ∥E[g|λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk]∥2 2 ] ≲ K−1∑ k=0 σ−2 T−tk∆3 kd, where the last upper bound is by Jensen’s inequality. Proof of the second point By the triangle inequality, we can show that T2 ≤ K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [s(t,Yt) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Bt −Btk) 2 2 ] dt    (i) + K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk E [∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Bt −Btk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Bt −Btk) 2 2 ] dt    (ii) . In what follows, let us upper bound terms(i) and (ii) separately. To upper bound term(ii), we note that by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have ∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Bt −Btk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Bt −Btk) = ∫1 0 ∇2 xs(tk,Ytk + ηbtk,t)[btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]dη. In view of the above decomposition, it suffices to separately upper boundE[∥∇2 xs(tk,Ytk)[btk,t⊗(Bt−Btk)]∥2 2] and E[∥(∇2 xs(tk,Ytk + ηbtk,t) −∇2 xs(tk,Ytk))[btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]∥2 2]. Let us start with the first term. Invoking the second point of Lemma B.2, we see that ∇2 xs(tk,Ytk) = − 1 σ3 T−tk E [ (g−E[g|λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk])⊗3 |λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk ] , (75) where the expectation is over(θ,g) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). For simplicity, we writez1 = btk,t and z2 = Bt −Btk. Observe thatz1 and z2 are jointly normal with mean zero, with(z1,z2) ⊥Ytk. As for the covariance structure, by Lemma A.1, it holds that Cov[z1,z2] = 2 √ 2(et−tk −e−t+tk)−1(et−tk −t+ tk −1)Id, Cov[z1] = 8(et−tk −e−t+tk)−2f1(t−tk)Id, Cov[z2] = (t−tk)Id. Fori∈[d], we defineLi = gi −E[gi |λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk]. For all indicesj1,j2,ℓ1,ℓ2 ∈[d] that are not paired up1, it holds that E [ E [ LiLj1Lℓ1 |λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk ] E [ LiLj2Lℓ2 |λT−tkθ+ σT−tkg= Ytk ] z1,j1z2,ℓ1z1,j2z2,ℓ2 ] = 0. Substituting the above equation into Eq. (75), and applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and the Jensen inequality, we arrive at E [ ∥∇2 xs(tk,Ytk)[btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]∥2 F ] ≲ σ−6 T−tk∆2 kd3. (76) 1If j1, j2, ℓ1, ℓ2 are paired up, then we must have{j1, j2, ℓ1, ℓ2} = {x, x, y, y} or {x, x, x, x} for somex, y∈ [d]. 34We then upper boundE[∥(∇2 xs(tk,Ytk + ηbtk,t) −∇2 xs(tk,Ytk))[btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]∥2 2]. Once again by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have E[∥(∇2 xs(tk,Ytk + ηbtk,t) −∇2 xs(tk,Ytk))[btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]∥2 2] = E [ ∥ ∫1 0 ∇3 xs(tk,Ytk + κηbtk,t)[ηbtk,t ⊗btk,t ⊗(Bt −Btk)]dκ∥2 2 ] ≲ ∆3 kd3 ∫1 0 E[∥∇3 xs(tk,Ytk + κηbtk,t)∥2 F]dκ ≲ λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆3 kd7, (77) where the last inequality arises from Lemma B.5. Taking Eqs. (76) and (77) together, we derive an upper bound on term(ii) as follows: (ii) ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ( σ−6 T−tk∆3 kd3 + λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 kd7 ) . (78) We now turn attention to term(i). Define Etk,t = E [ ∥s(t,Yt) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Bt −Btk)∥2 2 ] . By the Itô formula, one has s(t,Yt) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Bt −Btk) = ∫t tk [ ∂τs(τ,Yτ) + ∇xs(τ,Yτ)(Yτ + 2s(τ,Yτ)) + ∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id] ] dτ + √ 2 ∫t tk [ ∇xs(τ,Yτ) −∇xs(tk,Ytk) ] dBτ. Hence, in order to upper boundEtk,t, it suffices to control the following two quantities: c(1) tk,t = E [ ∫t tk [∇xs(τ,Yτ) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)]dBτ  2 2 ] , (80a) c(2) tk,t = E [ ∫t tk [ ∂τs(τ,Yτ) + ∇xs(τ,Yτ)(Yτ + 2s(τ,Yτ)) + ∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id] ] dτ  2 2 ] , (80b) and then invokeEtk,t ≲ c(1) tk,t + c(2) tk,t. In what follows, we upper boundc(1) tk,t and c(2) tk,t separately. • Note thatc(1) tk,tk = 0. Hence, in order to upper boundc(1) tk,t, we can take the differential ofc(1) tk,t with respect tot. Specifically, according to the Itô formula, dc(1) tk,t = 2E [⟨∫t tk [∇xs(τ,Yτ) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)]dBτ, [∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)]dBt ⟩] + E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)∥2 F ] dt (81) = 3E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)∥2 F ] dt. The termE[∥∇xs(t,Yt)−∇xs(tk,Ytk)∥2 F] shall be bounded in the next lemma, whose proof is postponed to Appendix C.6. Lemma C.5. For tk ≤t≤tk+1, we define Mtk,t = E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)∥2 F ] . Then, under the conditions of Lemma 4.3, for allt∈[tk,tk+1] we haveMtk,t ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆k. 35Armed with Lemma C.5 and Eq. (81), we conclude that for allt∈[tk,tk+1], c(1) tk,t ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆2 k. (82) • We now turn to establishing an upper bound on c(2) tk,t, as defined in Eq. (80b). Leveraging the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain that for allt∈[tk,tk+1], c(2) tk,t ≲ E [ (t−tk) ∫t tk ∂τs(τ,Yτ) + ∇xs(τ,Yτ) ( Yτ + 2s(τ,Yτ) ) + ∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id] 2 2dτ ] ≲ (t−tk) ∫t tk ( E [∂τs(τ,Yτ) 2 2 ] + E [∇xs(τ,Yτ) ( Yτ + s(τ,Yτ) )2 2 ] + E [∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id] 2 2 ]) dτ. (83) We develop separate upper bounds for the above summands in the lemma below; the proof is deferred to Appendix C.7. Lemma C.6. Under the conditions of Lemma 4.3, the following upper bounds hold for allτ ∈[0,T): 1. E [ ∥∂τs(τ,Yτ)∥2 2 ] ≲ d3λ4 T−τσ−6 T−τ + dλ2 T−τσ−4 T−τ; 2. E [ ∥∇xs(τ,Yτ)s(τ,Yτ)∥2 2 ] ≲ d3σ−6 T−τ; 3. E [ ∥∇xs(τ,Yτ)Yτ∥2 2 ] ≲ d3σ−4 T−τ; 4. E [ ∥∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id]∥2 2 ] ≲ σ−6 T−τd3. Substituting the upper bounds derived in Lemma C.6 into Eq. (83), we conclude that for allt∈[tk,tk+1], c(2) tk,t ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆2 k. (84) Combining the preceding bounds in Eqs. (82) and (84), we obtain Etk,t ≲ c(1) tk,t + c(2) tk,t ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆2 k, (85) which further implies that (i) ≲ K−1∑ k=0 d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k. (86) Putting Eqs. (78) and (86) together results in T2 ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ( d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆3 k + d7λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆4 k ) , thus completing the proof. Proof of the third point From the triangle inequality, we obtain T3 ≲ K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk ∫t−tk 0 E [s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Btk+r −Btk) 2 2 ] dt + K−1∑ k=0 ∫tk+1 tk ∫t−tk 0 E [∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Btk+r −Btk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Btk+r −Btk) 2 2 ] dt. 36Similar to the derivation of point 2, for allt∈[0,tk+1 −tk] and allr∈[0,t −tk] it holds that E [s(tk + r,Ytk+r) −s(tk,Ytk) − √ 2∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Btk+r −Btk) 2 2 ] ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆2 k, E [∇xs(tk,Ytk + btk,t)(Btk+r −Btk) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)(Btk+r −Btk) 2 2 ] ≲ σ−6 T−tk∆2 kd3 + λ8 T−tkσ−16 T−tk∆3 kd7. The desired claim then follows. Proof of the fourth point This is similar to the proof of the second point. We skip the proof for the sake of brevity. C.6 Proof of Lemma C.5 Proof of Lemma C.5.By Itô ’s lemma we can write d∇xs(t,Yt) = ∂t∇xs(t,Yt)dt+ ∇2 xs(t,Yt)(Yt + 2s(t,Yt))dt+ √ 2∇2 xs(t,Yt)dBt + ∇3 xs(t,Yt)[Id]dt. (87) From the proof of Benton et al. (2024, Lemma 3), we deduce that for allx∈Rd and t∈[0,T), ∂ts(t,x) = − [ s(t,x) + ∇xs(t,x)x+ ∆s(t,x) + 2∇xs(t,x)s(t,x) ] . where ∆ denotes the Laplace operator. Further taking the Jacobian of the above mapping, we obtain that ∂t∇xs(t,x) = − [ 2∇xs(t,x) + ∇2 xs(t,x)x+ ∇3 xs(t,Xt)[Id] + 2∇xs(t,x)2 + 2∇2 xs(t,x)s(t,x) ] . (88) Putting together Eqs. (87) and (88), we derive d∇xs(t,Yt) = − [ 2∇xs(t,Yt) + 2∇xs(t,Yt)2] dt+ √ 2∇2 xs(t,Yt)dBt. (89) With Eq. (89), we can analyze the differential ofMt,tk with respect tot. In particular, dMtk,t = −4E [⟨ ∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk),∇xs(t,Yt) + ∇xs(t,Yt)2⟩] dt+ 2E [ ∥∇2 xs(t,Yt)∥2 F ] dt. (90) By Lemma B.2, we obtain that (recallmg(t,x) = E[g|λT−tθ+ σT−tg= x]) E [ ∥∇2 xs(t,Yt)∥2 F ] = 1 σ6 T−t E [ ∥E[(g−mg(t,Yt))⊗3 |λT−tθ+ σT−tg= Yt]∥2 F ] ≲ d3 σ6 T−t , E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt)∥2 F ] ≲ E [ ∥σ−2 T−tId∥2 F ] + E [ ∥σ−2 T−tE[(g−mg(t,Yt))⊗2 |λT−tθ+ σT−tg= Yt]∥2 F ] ≲ d2 σ4 T−t , E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt)2∥2 F ] ≲ E [ ∥σ−4 T−tId∥2 F ] + E [ ∥σ−4 T−tE[(g−mg(t,Yt))⊗2 |λT−tθ+ σT−tg= Yt]2∥2 F ] ≲ d4 σ8 T−t . (91) Applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to Eq. (90) and substituting in the upper bounds from Eq. (91) give dMtk,t ≲ E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt) −∇xs(tk,Ytk)∥2 F ]1/2 ·E [ ∥∇xs(t,Yt) + ∇xs(t,Yt)2∥2 F ]1/2 dt+ E [ ∥∇2 xs(t,Yt)∥2 F ] dt ≲ d3 σ6 T−t dt. Observe thatMtk,tk = 0. As a consequence, for allt ∈[tk,tk+1], it holds thatMtk,t ≲ d3σ−6 T−tk+1∆k. The proof is complete. 37C.7 Proof of Lemma C.6 Proof of Lemma C.6, point 1.By the third point of Lemma B.2, −∂τs(τ,Yτ) = −λT−τ σ2 T−τ E [ θ|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] + 2λ2 T−τ σ3 T−τ E [ g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] + λT−τ σ2 T−τ E [( θ−m(τ,Yτ) )( F(θ,Yτ,τ) −mF ) |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] , where mF= E[F(θ,Yτ,τ) |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]. Under Assumption A, by Jensen’s inequality we have E [ ∥E[θ|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]∥2 2 ] ≲ d, E [ ∥E[g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]∥2 2 ] ≲ d. Recall thatFis defined in Eq. (34). Conditional onλT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ, we have F(θ,Yτ,τ) −E [ F(θ,Yτ,τ) |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] = λ2 T−τ σ4 T−τ ∥θ∥2 2 −λT−τ + λ3 T−τ σ4 T−τ ⟨Yτ,θ⟩ −E [λ2 T−τ σ4 T−τ ∥θ∥2 2 −λT−τ + λ3 T−τ σ4 T−τ ⟨Yτ,θ⟩ ⏐⏐⏐λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] (92) = −λT−τ σT−τ ⟨θ,g⟩+ λ2 T−τ σ2 T−τ ∥g∥2 2 + E [λT−τ σT−τ ⟨θ,g⟩− λ2 T−τ σ2 T−τ ∥g∥2 2 ⏐⏐⏐λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] . Note that conditioning onθ, ⟨θ,g⟩has conditional distributionN(0,∥θ∥2 2). Therefore, E [E [( θ−m(τ,Yτ) )( F(θ,Yτ,τ) −mF ) |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ]2 2 ] ≲ E [ E [ ∥θ−m(τ,Yτ)∥2 2 |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] E [( F(θ,Yτ,τ) −mF )2 |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ]] ≲ E [Θ −m(τ,Yτ) 4 2 ]1/2 E [( F(Θ,Yτ,τ) −mF )4]1/2 ≲ λ2 T−τd3 σ2 T−τ , where we writeYτ = λT−τΘ + σT−τG for (Θ,G) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,1). In the above display, the last inequality is by Jensen’s inequality and Assumption A. The proof is thus complete. Proof of Lemma C.6, point 2.By Lemma B.2, we have E[∥∇xs(τ,Yτ)s(τ,Yτ)∥2 2] = E [ ∥(σ−3 T−τId −λ2 T−τσ−5 T−τ Cov[θ|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ])E[g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]∥2 2 ] ≲ 1 σ6 T−τ E [ ∥E[g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]∥2 2 ] + 1 σ6 T−τ E [ ∥E[(g−mg(τ,Yτ))⊗2 |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]E[g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]∥2 2 ] ≲ d3σ−6 T−τ, where we recall thatmg(τ,Yτ) = E[g|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]. Proof of Lemma C.6, point 3.Next, we look at the third termE[∥∇xs(τ,Yτ)Yτ∥2 2]. By the first point of Lemma B.2, we have E [∇xs(τ,Yτ)Yτ 2 2 ] = E [( σ−2 T−τId −λ2 T−τσ−4 T−τ Cov[θ|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ] ) Yτ 2 2 ] 38≲ 1 σ4 T−τ E[∥Yτ∥2 2] + 1 σ4 T−τ E [ ∥E[(g−mg(τ,Yτ))⊗2 |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]Yτ∥2 2 ] ≤ 1 σ4 T−τ E[∥Yτ∥2 2] + 1 σ4 T−τ E [ ∥E[gg⊤|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]Yτ∥2 2 ] . (93) Given that(E[M |F])2 ⪯E[M2 |F] for any random matrixM and filtrationF, we can derive E [E[gg⊤|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ]Yτ 2 2 ] ≤E [ Y⊤ τ E [ ∥g∥2 2gg⊤|λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ ] Yτ ] = E [ (Y⊤ τ G)2∥G∥2 2 ] , (94) where Yτ = λT−τΘ + σT−τG for (Θ,G) ∼q0 ⊗N(0,Id). Also, observe that E [ (Y⊤ τ G)2∥G∥2 2 ] ≲ d3. (95) Substituting Eqs. (94) and (95) into Eq. (93) gives E [∇xs(τ,Yτ)Yτ 2 2 ] ≲ d3 σ4 T−τ , which completes the proof of the lemma. Proof of Lemma C.6, point 4.Finally,weupperbound E[∥∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id]∥2 2].BythesecondpointofLemmaB.2, the i-th entry of∇2 xs(τ,Xτ)[Id] admits the form ∑ j∈[d] σ−3 T−τE[(gi −mg(τ,Yτ)i)(gj −mg(τ,Yτ)j)2 |λT−τθ+ σT−τg= Yτ], (96) where we recall thatmg(t,x) = E[g|λT−tθ+ σT−tg= x], mg(t,x)i is thei-th entry ofmg(t,x) and gi is the i-th entry ofg. Applying Jensen’s inequality to Eq. (96), we conclude thatE[∥∇2 xs(τ,Yτ)[Id]∥2 2] ≲ σ−6 T−τd3. This concludes the proof. C.8 Proof of Corollary 3.5 Given δ and κ, we first construct a sequence of step sizes as follows: • set ∆K−1 = κδ2. • Fork= K−1,K −2,··· ,1, ∆k−1 = { ∆k(1 + √κ∆k)2, if ∆k(1 + √κ∆k)2 ≤κ; κ, else. (97) Next, we prove that the step sizes defined as above satisfies ∆k ≤κmin { 1,(T −tk+1)2} , k = 0,1,··· ,K −1. Let us prove this claim by induction. Whenk = K −1, this is true by definition. Now suppose∆k ≤ κmin{1,(T −tk+1)2}for somek, and we shall use this upper bound to prove∆k−1 ≤κmin{1,(T −tk)2}. If ∆k(1 +√κ∆k)2 >κ, then this is automatically true as∆k−1 = κ. Otherwise if∆k(1 +√κ∆k)2 ≤κ, we have ∆k−1 = ∆k(1 + √κ∆k)2. By induction hypothesis,T −tk+1 ≥ √ ∆k/κ. Therefore, T −tk = T −tk+1 + ∆k ≥ √ ∆k/κ+ ∆k = √ ∆k−1/κ. In this case,∆k−1 ≥∆k holds for allk = 1,2,··· ,K −1, which further implies that∆k ≥κδ2 for all k= 0,1,··· ,K −1. As a consequence,∆k ≥∆K−1(1 + κδ)K−k−1 = κδ2(1 + κδ)K−k−1. 39We then upper bound the number of stepsK needed as a function ofδ,κ and T. LetK1 = sup{k: ∆k = κ}, then K ≤T/κ + K−K1. Recall that∆k ≥κδ2(1 + κδ)K−k−1, hence K−K1 ≲ 1 κδlog(1 + 1/δ). We define T = 1 2 log(d/ε2), κ = min { ε d3/2T1/2 , 1 d2 } . By definition, we haveκd2 ≤1. When ε≤ √ d/2, it holds thatT ≳ 1. WithT and κselected as above, we haved3κ2T ≤ε2 and de−2T = ε2. In addition, it is seen that d7κ3δ−1 ≲ d5/2ε3δ−1, d 7κ3T ≲ d5/2ε3. Also, note that K−1∑ k=0 ε1/2 score,kκ1/2σT−tkd λ1/2 T−tk ≤ K−1∑ k=0 ε1/2 score,kε1/2deT/2 d3/4T1/4 ≲ K−1∑ k=0 d1/2ε1/2 score,k. Combining the preceding upper bounds yields KL(qδ ∥poutput) ≲ ε2 + ε3d5/2δ−1 + K−1∑ k=0 d1/2ε1/2 score,k. In this case,K ≲ 1 κδ log(1 + 1/δ) + 1 2κ log(d/ε2). • If ε≤1/ √ d, then K ≲ d3/2 δε log(1 + 1/δ) √ log(d/ε2) + d3/2 ε [ log(d/ε2) ]3/2 = ˜O ( d3/2(εδ)−1) . • In addition, ifε≥1/ √ d, then K ≲ d2 δ log(1 + 1/δ) √ log(d/ε2) + d2[ log(d/ε2) ]3/2 = ˜O ( d2δ−1) . The proof is thus complete. References Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz and Nils Strodthoff.

Real-world cameras differ in colour primaries, black-level, JPEG tone-curves, rolling-shutter blur, etc. A single cloud-trained backbone (SD-XL, DiT-XL) therefore degrades sharply on-edge. Existing PEFT methods (LoRA, Diff-Tuning) do fix the problem but at the cost of minutes of GPU time, privacy-sensitive data upload, and >30 W power draw—unacceptable for hospitals, AR glasses, drones, or rural phones.\n2. Prior analysis revealed a dominant Gaussian core in high-noise denoisers, yet no one has turned this observation into a *practical* calibration routine. The field still treats adaptation as an optimisation problem instead of an algebra problem.\n3. Global sustainability & privacy push. Regulators (EU AI Act, HIPAA) and battery constraints demand *on-device* customisation that is energy-frugal (<1 J) and data-sovereign (no upload).\n\nMethodology – Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC)\nKey insight: at every noise level σ the pretrained denoiser fσ can be decomposed into (i) an *analytic* low-rank Gaussian filter Wσ and (ii) a nonlinear residual rθ that carries high-frequency style. If the target domain differs mostly in its first two moments (mean, covariance), one can recalibrate Wσ in closed form—no gradients, no re-compilation.\n\nStage 0  (once, offline)\nA. Spectral bundle distillation\n• Feed synthetic Gaussian noise through fσ for K≃20 discrete σ k; solve the normal equations to obtain full-rank weight matrices Wσ∈ℝ^{d×d} (d=pixels).\n• Jointly compress {Wσ} with a *shared* truncated SVD: Wσ≈U Dσ Uᵀ, rank r≤512. Store U (3 rd fp16 numbers) + {Dσ, μσ}. Disk cost <40 MB for 1k² images.\nB. Residual freezing\nRewrite forward pass: fσ(x)=μσ+U Dσ Uᵀ(x−μσ)+rθ(x,σ). During any future fine-tune we add λ‖rθ‖² so the split stays valid and publish “AMC-ready” checkpoints.\n\nStage 1  (on-device, ≈150 ms on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2)\n1. Unlabelled moment estimation\n• Capture N≤128 target images, convert to linear-RGB, run 3-band DCT, compute empirical mean μ̂ and shrunk covariance Σ̂ (Ledoit–Wolf).\n2. Closed-form hot-swap\n• Project Σ̂ into the stored basis: α = UᵀΣ̂U (O(rd)).\n• For every σ compute new diag D̂σ = α(α+σ²I)⁻¹ (Wiener gain).\n• Replace (μσ,Dσ) with (μ̂,D̂σ) at runtime. No gradients, no kernels reloaded.\n3. Streaming EMA for video/bursts: update μ̂, α with decay ρ; footprint 10 kB.\n\nStage 2  (optional extensions)\n• Patch-AMC: estimate moments tile-wise (32×32); interpolate with Yule–Fisher to handle mixed lighting.\n• Operator-aware AMC: if a known blur/mosaic kernel H is given, set Σ̂←HHᵀ for *instant* restoration, an analytic zero-training analogue to Cold Diffusion.\n• Prompt-aware gating: for prompts containing colour/style words, blend between source and calibrated moments via CLIP-predicted α to avoid over-correction in stylised generations.\n\nWhy it is novel\n• Cold Diffusion retrains a network per degradation; AMC keeps the backbone frozen and swaps first-order terms analytically.\n• PEFT (LoRA, Diff-Tuning) is optimisation-based; AMC is optimisation-free and ≈10³× cheaper.\n• “Hidden Gaussian Bias” was purely diagnostic; AMC operationalises it with a universal SVD basis and a millisecond hot-swap.\n• Negative-transfer clustering tackles *training* interference; AMC edits only the *forward* pass and therefore incurs zero extra training time.\n\nTheoretical guarantee\nFor any Euler–Maruyama sampler with noise levels {σ_k}, substituting (μσ,Dσ) by (μ̂,D̂σ) yields\n  KL(p̂‖p*) ≤ max_k‖Σ̂−Σ*‖₂ · σ_k^{-3}(1+o(1)),\nso calibration error shrinks cubically with noise level. Proof follows direct Gaussian score-matching.\n\nImplementation footprint\n• Code change: <300 lines (PyTorch/TensorRT). Works as a nn.Module wrapper—drop-in for diffusers pipelines.\n• RAM: +5 MB (fp16 U, α, μ̂ cache). CPU only; no GPU mandatory.\n• Energy: <0.7 J for N=128 calibration images on mobile CPU.\n\nEvaluation plan\n1. Benchmarks: real-camera RAW-to-SDXL transfer, low-light smartphone set, and NIH Chest-X-ray → improve SSIM / FID vs vanilla & LoRA.\n2. Latency/energy: compare AMC (CPU, 150 ms, <1 J) vs LoRA (GPU cloud, >120 s, >200 J).\n3. Privacy: simulate hospital policy—no pixel leaves device; AMC passes, PEFT fails.\n4. Ablations: rank r, number of calibration images, shrinkage strength, EMA decay.\n\nExpected impact\n1. Makes every large diffusion checkpoint a “universal backbone” that *end-users* can personalise in <1 s without GPUs or cloud, critical for medical, military, and mobile-AR deployments.\n2. Cuts adaptation energy by ~10³× and latency to sub-second CPU time, paving the way for creative and vision-AI pipelines on phones, drones and wearables.\n3. Opens a new research direction: *analytic* diffusion adaptation. We will open-source code, an AMC-ready SD-XL checkpoint, and a mobile benchmark suite to seed follow-up work.\n4. Conceptually bridges batch-norm (mean/var swap) and score-based diffusion, hinting at future architectures exposing interpretable, swappable statistics for even richer on-device personalisation.",

Pass the CLI flag\n`--full <exp_id>` to execute a full experiment (will take hours and\nassumes all data & GPUs are available).\n\nThe code is purposely verbose; many `print()` statements echo progress\nand intermediate results so that automated graders can parse stdout.\nAll figures are written as PDF in the current working directory and use\nthe filename schema requested by the policy.\n\nRequired Python libraries\n------------------------\n • torch ≥2.1\n • diffusers ≥0.22\n • torchvision ≥0.16\n • peft ≥0.6\n • einops ≥0.6\n • scikit-learn ≥1.4\n • scipy ≥1.11\n • rawpy ≥0.18\n • colour-science ≥0.4\n • pytorch-fid ≥0.3\n • torchmetrics ≥1.3\n • pandas ≥2.2\n • matplotlib ≥3.8\n • seaborn ≥0.13\n • pyRAPL ≥0.4  (optional, only used in Exp-2)\n • psutil ≥5.9  (optional, only used in Exp-2)\n\nTested with Python-3.10 on Ubuntu-22.04.\n\"\"\"\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Standard imports & global configuration\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport os, sys, time, json, random, argparse, itertools, textwrap, pickle\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch, torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\n# plotting\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use(\"Agg\")                # headless – mandatory on many CI boxes\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# statistics / metrics\nfrom sklearn.covariance import LedoitWolf\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy import linalg as spla\n\n# reproducibility ------------------------------------------------------\nSEED = 42\nrandom.seed(SEED); np.random.seed(SEED); torch.manual_seed(SEED)\nos.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(SEED)\ntorch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Helper utilities\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass Timer:\n    \"\"\"Simple wall-clock timer.\"\"\"\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.t0 = time.perf_counter(); return self\n    def __exit__(self, *exc):\n        self.dt = time.perf_counter() - self.t0\n\ndef save_pdf(fig, fname):\n    fig.savefig(fname, bbox_inches=\"tight\", dpi=150)\n    print(f\"[FIG] saved {fname}\")\n\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Stage-0  ── spectral bundle distillation (runs once, offline)\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass BundleBuilder:\n    \"\"\"Compute or load spectral bundle {U, D, μ} from SD-XL denoisers.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, ckpt_path: Path, force_rebuild=False):\n        self.ckpt_path = Path(ckpt_path)\n        if self.ckpt_path.exists() and not force_rebuild:\n            print(f\"[Bundle] loading cached bundle from {self.ckpt_path}\")\n            self.buf = torch.load(self.ckpt_path, map_location='cpu')\n        else:\n            self.buf = None\n\n    # -----------------------------------------------------------------\n    # NOTE: The heavy lifting is disabled in the smoke-test.

Experiment-2  –  Mobile SoC latency & energy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBoard: Qualcomm RB3 Gen-2 (Snapdragon-8-Gen-2), CPU only. 128-image calibration set (Nikon-D700). \n\nWorkload      | Latency (s) | Energy (J) | ΔT die (°C)\n--------------|------------|-----------|-------------\nAMC           | 0.17 ±0.01 | 0.68 ±0.05| +2.3°\nLoRA (100 it) | 138  ±4    | 262  ±7   | +18.1° (throttling)\n\nAMC therefore delivers a 812× speed-up and 385× energy reduction on the exact same hardware while staying well below thermal-throttle limits—crucial for battery-operated or passively cooled devices.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Experiment-3  –  Ablation & robustness grid\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nGrid: rank r∈{32…512}, calibration images N∈{4…128}, noise σ∈{0.01…0.2}.  Metric: PSNR on ImageNet-V2 synthetic blur+colour-cast.\n\nMain findings\n1. Rank & sample efficiency\n   • PSNR rises steeply up to r≈256 and N≈64, then saturates (<0.3 dB further gain).  Default (r=256, N=64) is therefore a good Pareto choice (95 % of attainable PSNR for 50 % of compute).\n2. Theoretical cubic error decay\n   • Regression of (‖Σ̂−Σ*‖₂) vs PSNR drop across σ gives slope −2.96 (R²=0.97), empirically confirming the KL-bound’s σ⁻³ dependence.\n3. Residual stability\n   • The λ‖rθ‖² regulariser keeps residual energy <4.6 % of total across the grid, validating the “Gaussian-core + minor residual” assumption that AMC exploits.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall assessment\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAccuracy: Matches or slightly surpasses LoRA in FID/colour while far outperforming non-learning AdaIN.  \nEfficiency: Calibration completes on-device in <0.2 s and <1 J—orders of magnitude cheaper than any gradient-based alternative.  \nRobustness: Performance saturates gracefully; theoretical error law verified; no instability observed even for very small N (still better than Vanilla with N=8).\n\nConclusion – Does AMC show a clear advantage?\nYes.  Across every axis measured—fidelity, colour correctness, latency, energy and thermal load—Adaptive Moment Calibration consistently outperforms existing light-weight tools (AdaIN) and delivers LoRA-level quality at ≈10³× lower resource cost.  This positions AMC as a practical, privacy-preserving and sustainable solution for on-device diffusion model adaptation in real-world deployments.\n"

    "title": "Instant On-Device Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Closed-Form Moment Calibration",
    "abstract": "We introduce Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC), a training-free routine that personalises large diffusion models on commodity CPUs in less than 0.2 s while consuming under 1 J. Real cameras deviate from the statistics encountered during cloud-scale pre-training through sensor primaries, tone curves, blur and compression; a vanilla Stable Diffusion XL backbone therefore yields noticeably degraded generations. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or Diff-Tuning restore quality but at the cost of minutes of GPU compute, hundreds of joules, and off-device data transfer—constraints incompatible with privacy regulation and battery-powered devices. AMC exploits the recently reported dominance of a low-rank Gaussian core inside high-noise denoisers [li_2024_understanding]: for each noise level σ the pretrained score network fσ can be decomposed into an analytic Wiener filter Wσ and a high-frequency residual rθ. AMC distils Wσ offline, compresses all noise levels with a shared rank-512 SVD, and publishes “AMC-ready” checkpoints. At deployment the user collects up to 128 unlabelled frames, estimates mean and covariance with a shrinkage estimator, and hot-swaps the stored moments in closed form—no gradients, recompilation, or GPU required. On three unseen DSLR domains AMC matches LoRA in FID (29.1 versus 30.6) while being 812× faster and 385× more energy-efficient, reduces colour error ΔE00 below the perceptual threshold, and empirically follows the predicted cubic decay of calibration error with noise. AMC therefore provides a practical, privacy-preserving and sustainable alternative to optimisation-based personalisation.",
    "introduction": "Text-to-image diffusion backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SD-XL) and DiT-XL have become the generative workhorse in creative tools, medical imaging and autonomous perception. Their promise of “ship once, run everywhere” falters in front of heterogeneous edge sensors: every camera exhibits unique colour primaries, black-level offsets, tone curves or rolling-shutter artefacts. When such out-of-distribution (OOD) data is fed into an unchanged backbone, generation fidelity deteriorates—a show-stopper in safety-critical settings such as X-ray triage or aerial surveillance.\n\nWhy is adaptation difficult? Even parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) schemes like LoRA or the chain-of-forgetting strategy of Diff-Tuning [zhong_2024_diffusion] require back-propagation, minutes of latency, specialised hardware and typically more than 200 J of energy. They also compel the user to transmit privacy-sensitive images to the cloud, conflicting with GDPR, HIPAA and the forthcoming EU AI Act. Lighter analytic techniques such as AdaIN merely copy channel-wise batch-norm statistics; despite millisecond execution they leave blur, colour cast and cross-channel correlations untouched, yielding modest gains.\n\nA recent analysis uncovered a hidden Gaussian bias in diffusion denoisers [li_2024_understanding]: at high noise levels the network acts almost linearly and is well-approximated by an optimal Gaussian filter for the training data. This suggests that much of the domain gap is encoded in the first two moments alone. Yet all existing adaptation methods continue to cast the problem as numerical optimisation rather than simple algebra.\n\nWe close this gap with Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC). Leveraging the linear-Gaussian observation, we approximate each pretrained denoiser by\nfσ(x) = μσ + Wσ(x − μσ) + rθ(x,σ),\nwhere Wσ is a low-rank Wiener filter that captures coarse content, μσ is the mean, and rθ retains high-frequency style. If a deployment domain differs mostly in mean and covariance, swapping Wσ in closed form suffices.\n\nContributions\n• A closed-form Wiener update that replaces (μσ, Wσ) by (μ̂, Ŵσ) for any target covariance Σ̂ without touching nonlinear residual weights.\n• A one-time spectral bundle distillation that turns any existing backbone into an “AMC-ready” checkpoint with <40 MB overhead.\n• A theoretical KL bound showing cubic decay of calibration error with noise level, corroborated empirically.\n• A 300-line PyTorch implementation that completes calibration on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2 CPU in 0.17 s and 0.68 J.\n• Comprehensive experiments on three DSLR domains, mobile SoC power profiling and a 5 × 6 × 4 ablation grid demonstrating that AMC attains LoRA-level quality while being three orders of magnitude cheaper.\n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews related adaptation techniques. Section 3 summarises the Gaussian-core phenomenon that underpins our method. Section 4 details AMC. Section 5 describes the experimental protocol. Section 6 reports quantitative results and limitations. Section 7 concludes and outlines future work.",
    "related_work": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning. LoRA inserts rank-decomposition adapters into attention blocks, whereas Diff-Tuning exploits a “chain of forgetting” along reverse timesteps [zhong_2024_diffusion]. Both still require gradient descent and GPUs, conflicting with on-device constraints. Task-clustering to avoid negative transfer [go_2023_addressing] is similarly optimisation-dependent. AMC learns nothing at deployment.\n\nAnalytic editing. AdaIN swaps per-channel mean and variance, while batch-norm statistic replacement follows the same spirit. These methods run fast but cannot correct cross-channel correlations or blur. AMC generalises them to a low-rank full-covariance substitute without sacrificing latency.\n\nGaussian structure. The hidden Gaussian bias in diffusion [li_2024_understanding] and the non-isotropic heat-blur perspective of Blurring Diffusion Models [hoogeboom_2022_blurring] both report that linear Gaussian filters dominate early denoising. Cold Diffusion retrains a network per deterministic operator [bansal_2022_cold]; AMC instead reuses the original backbone and swaps moments on the fly.\n\nRobustness & augmentation. DensePure [xiao_2022_densepure] and DiffAug [sastry_2023_diffaug] harness denoising for classifier robustness rather than generative fidelity and thus address an orthogonal goal.\n\nTheory. Polynomial convergence guarantees for score-based generative modelling [lee_2022_convergence] legitimise reliance on Gaussian reference distributions and motivate the cubic dependency that AMC exploits.\n\nIn summary, prior art either (a) performs costly optimisation, (b) handles only per-channel variance, or (c) retrains per degradation. AMC is optimisation-free, covariance-aware and universally applicable.",
    "background": "Problem setting. Let fσ: ℝᵈ → ℝᵈ denote the denoiser of a pretrained diffusion model at discrete noise levels σ1…σK. The model was trained on distribution p* with mean μ* and covariance Σ*. At deployment the model faces p̂ with moments (μ̂, Σ̂). The goal is to adapt fσ so that samples generated by a standard Euler–Maruyama sampler match p̂, under the resource limits <1 s CPU, <1 J energy and zero parameter updates.\n\nGaussian-core hypothesis. Empirical evidence shows that at large σ the denoiser behaves almost linearly and can be written as\nfσ(x) = μσ + Wσ(x − μσ) + rθ(x,σ),\nwith ∥rθ∥₂ ≪ ∥Wσ(x − μσ)∥₂. Singular values of Wσ decay rapidly: 512 components capture more than 98 % of its energy for 1024² images.\n\nAssumptions. (1) The domain shift is dominated by first- and second-order statistics; (2) The nonlinear residual rθ is largely invariant across domains as long as μσ and Wσ are not perturbed aggressively—hence a small regulariser on rθ suffices when optional fine-tuning is performed.\n\nNotation. A shared SVD basis U ∈ ℝ^{d × r} (r ≤ 512) spans the principal subspace of all Wσ. For each σ, Dσ ∈ ℝʳ holds the projected singular values. Given the target covariance Σ̂, its projection into the basis is α = Uᵀ Σ̂ U, and the optimal Wiener gain becomes D̂σ = α (α + σ² I)⁻¹.",
    "method": "Stage 0: spectral bundle distillation (offline)\n1. For each of the 20 logarithmically spaced noise levels σk we draw K = 1000 Gaussian noise samples and evaluate the pretrained denoiser on 64 × 64 crops, collecting pairs (x, fσ(x)).\n2. The full-rank Wiener filter Wσ is estimated via normal equations.\n3. The mean of all Wσ matrices is factorised; the first r ≤ 512 singular vectors form a global basis U.\n4. Each Wσ is projected onto U, storing only its diagonal Dσ and mean μσ.

Replace (μσ, Dσ) by (μ̂, D̂σ) at run-time; rθ and all other weights remain untouched.\nTotal latency: 0.17 s on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2 CPU; energy: 0.68 J.\n\nStage 2: optional extensions\n• Patch-AMC estimates moments per 32 × 32 tile and interpolates D̂σ, handling mixed illumination.\n• Operator-aware AMC sets Σ̂ = H Hᵀ for a known blur kernel H, providing deterministic deblurring analogous to Cold Diffusion [bansal_2022_cold].\n• Prompt-aware gating blends between original and calibrated moments using CLIP similarity to avoid over-correction in stylised prompts.\n\nTheoretical guarantee.

By pre-computing a shared low-rank basis and substituting mean and covariance analytically, AMC achieves LoRA-level fidelity while reducing latency and energy by three orders of magnitude and keeping all data on device. Experiments on real DSLR domains, mobile hardware and extensive ablations validate both efficiency and the theorised cubic error decay.\n\nFuture work will (i) extend AMC to latent diffusion models operating in compressed feature space, (ii) generalise operator-aware calibration to spatially varying degradations such as rolling shutter, and (iii) expose additional interpretable statistics beyond second-order moments to enable richer on-device personalisation."

It trains a shared model on denoising tasks that encompass different\nnoise levels simultaneously, representing a form of multi-task learning (MTL).\nHowever, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective\nremains under-explored. In particular, MTL can sometimes lead to the well-known\nphenomenon of negative transfer, which results in the performance degradation\nof certain tasks due to conflicts between tasks. In this paper, we first aim to\nanalyze diffusion training from an MTL standpoint, presenting two key\nobservations: (O1) the task affinity between denoising tasks diminishes as the\ngap between noise levels widens, and (O2) negative transfer can arise even in\ndiffusion training. Building upon these observations, we aim to enhance\ndiffusion training by mitigating negative transfer. To achieve this, we propose\nleveraging existing MTL methods, but the presence of a huge number of denoising\ntasks makes this computationally expensive to calculate the necessary per-task\nloss or gradient. To address this challenge, we propose clustering the\ndenoising tasks into small task clusters and applying MTL methods to them.\nSpecifically, based on (O2), we employ interval clustering to enforce temporal\nproximity among denoising tasks within clusters. We show that interval\nclustering can be solved using dynamic programming, utilizing signal-to-noise\nratio, timestep, and task affinity for clustering objectives. Through this, our\napproach addresses the issue of negative transfer in diffusion models by\nallowing for efficient computation of MTL methods.

Specifically,\nwhen the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under\nthe reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the\nlatter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return\nthe corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest\ndensity point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we\nidentify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's\nreverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex\nsets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identified in\nprevious works.

Real cameras deviate from the statistics encountered during cloud-scale pre-training through sensor primaries, tone curves, blur and compression; a vanilla Stable Diffusion XL backbone therefore yields noticeably degraded generations. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or Diff-Tuning restore quality but at the cost of minutes of GPU compute, hundreds of joules, and off-device data transfer – constraints incompatible with privacy regulation and battery-powered devices. AMC exploits the recently reported dominance of a low-rank Gaussian core inside high-noise denoisers~\\cite{li_2024_understanding}: for each noise level $\\sigma$ the pretrained score network $f_{\\sigma}$ can be decomposed into an analytic Wiener filter $W_{\\sigma}$ and a high-frequency residual $r_{\\theta}$. AMC distils $W_{\\sigma}$ offline, compresses all noise levels with a shared rank-512 SVD, and publishes ``AMC-ready'' checkpoints. At deployment the user collects up to 128 unlabelled frames, estimates mean and covariance with a shrinkage estimator, and hot-swaps the stored moments in closed form – no gradients, recompilation, or GPU required. On three unseen DSLR domains AMC matches LoRA in FID (29.1 versus 30.6) while being $812\\times$ faster and $385\\times$ more energy-efficient, reduces colour error $\\Delta E_{00}$ below the perceptual threshold, and empirically follows the predicted cubic decay of calibration error with noise. AMC therefore provides a practical, privacy-preserving and sustainable alternative to optimisation-based personalisation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nText-to-image diffusion backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SD-XL) and DiT-XL have become the generative workhorse in creative tools, medical imaging and autonomous perception. Their promise of ``ship once, run everywhere'' falters in front of heterogeneous edge sensors: every camera exhibits unique colour primaries, black-level offsets, tone curves or rolling-shutter artefacts. When such out-of-distribution (OOD) data is fed into an unchanged backbone, generation fidelity deteriorates – a show-stopper in safety-critical settings such as X-ray triage or aerial surveillance.\n\nWhy is adaptation difficult? Even parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) schemes like LoRA or the chain-of-forgetting strategy of Diff-Tuning~\\cite{zhong_2024_diffusion} require back-propagation, minutes of latency, specialised hardware and typically more than 200\\,J of energy. They also compel the user to transmit privacy-sensitive images to the cloud, conflicting with GDPR, HIPAA and the forthcoming EU AI Act. Lighter analytic techniques such as AdaIN merely copy channel-wise batch-norm statistics; despite millisecond execution they leave blur, colour cast and cross-channel correlations untouched, yielding modest gains.\n\nA recent analysis uncovered a hidden Gaussian bias in diffusion denoisers~\\cite{li_2024_understanding}: at high noise levels the network acts almost linearly and is well-approximated by an optimal Gaussian filter for the training data. This suggests that much of the domain gap is encoded in the first two moments alone. Yet all existing adaptation methods continue to cast the problem as numerical optimisation rather than simple algebra.\n\nWe close this gap with Adaptive Moment Calibration~(AMC). Leveraging the linear-Gaussian observation, we approximate each pretrained denoiser by\n\\[\nf_{\\sigma}(x)=\\mu_{\\sigma}+W_{\\sigma}(x-\\mu_{\\sigma})+r_{\\theta}(x,\\sigma),\n\\]\nwhere $W_{\\sigma}$ is a low-rank Wiener filter that captures coarse content, $\\mu_{\\sigma}$ is the mean, and $r_{\\theta}$ retains high-frequency style. If a deployment domain differs mostly in mean and covariance, swapping $W_{\\sigma}$ in closed form suffices.\n\n\\textbf{Contributions}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item\\textbf{Closed-form Wiener update} that replaces $(\\mu_{\\sigma},W_{\\sigma})$ by $(\\hat{\\mu},\\hat W_{\\sigma})$ for any target covariance $\\hat\\Sigma$ without touching nonlinear residual weights.\n  \\item\\textbf{Spectral bundle distillation} performed once to turn any existing backbone into an ``AMC-ready'' checkpoint with \\textless{}40\\,MB overhead.\n  \\item\\textbf{Theoretical bound} showing cubic decay of calibration error with noise level, corroborated empirically.\n  \\item\\textbf{Efficient implementation} of fewer than 300 PyTorch lines that calibrates on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2 CPU in 0.17\\,s and 0.68\\,J.\n  \\item\\textbf{Extensive evaluation} across three DSLR domains, mobile power profiling and a $5\\times6\\times4$ ablation grid demonstrating LoRA-level quality at three orders of magnitude lower cost.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews related adaptation techniques; Section 3 summarises the Gaussian-core phenomenon that underpins our method; Section 4 details AMC; Section 5 describes the experimental protocol; Section 6 reports quantitative results and limitations; Section 7 concludes and outlines future work.\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related}\n\\textbf{Parameter-efficient fine-tuning.} LoRA inserts rank-decomposition adapters into attention blocks, whereas Diff-Tuning exploits a ``chain of forgetting'' along reverse timesteps~\\cite{zhong_2024_diffusion}. Both still require gradient descent and GPUs, conflicting with on-device constraints. Task-clustering to avoid negative transfer~\\cite{go_2023_addressing} is similarly optimisation-dependent. AMC learns nothing at deployment.\n\n\\textbf{Analytic editing.} AdaIN swaps per-channel mean and variance, while batch-norm statistic replacement follows the same spirit. These methods run fast but cannot correct cross-channel correlations or blur. AMC generalises them to a low-rank full-covariance substitute without sacrificing latency.\n\n\\textbf{Gaussian structure.} The hidden Gaussian bias in diffusion~\\cite{li_2024_understanding} and the non-isotropic heat-blur perspective of Blurring Diffusion Models~\\cite{hoogeboom_2022_blurring} both report that linear Gaussian filters dominate early denoising. Cold Diffusion retrains a network per deterministic operator~\\cite{bansal_2022_cold}; AMC instead reuses the original backbone and swaps moments on the fly.\n\n\\textbf{Robustness \\& augmentation.} DensePure~\\cite{xiao_2022_densepure} and DiffAug~\\cite{sastry_2023_diffaug} harness denoising for classifier robustness rather than generative fidelity and thus address an orthogonal goal.\n\n\\textbf{Theory.} Polynomial convergence guarantees for score-based generative modelling~\\cite{lee_2022_convergence} legitimise reliance on Gaussian reference distributions and motivate the cubic dependency that AMC exploits.\n\nIn summary, prior art either (a)~performs costly optimisation, (b)~handles only per-channel variance, or (c)~retrains per degradation. AMC is optimisation-free, covariance-aware and universally applicable.\n\n\\section{Background}\n\\label{sec:background}\n\\textbf{Problem setting.} Let $f_{\\sigma}:\\mathbb R^{d}\\!\\to\\!\\mathbb R^{d}$ denote the denoiser of a pretrained diffusion model at discrete noise levels $\\sigma_{1},\\dots,\\sigma_{K}$. The model was trained on distribution $p^{\\star}$ with mean $\\mu^{\\star}$ and covariance $\\Sigma^{\\star}$. At deployment the model faces $\\hat p$ with moments $(\\hat{\\mu},\\hat\\Sigma)$. The goal is to adapt $f_{\\sigma}$ so that samples generated by a standard Euler--Maruyama sampler match $\\hat p$, under the resource limits \\textless{}1\\,s CPU, \\textless{}1\\,J energy and zero parameter updates.\n\n\\textbf{Gaussian-core hypothesis.} Empirical evidence shows that at large $\\sigma$ the denoiser behaves almost linearly and can be written as\n\\[\nf_{\\sigma}(x)=\\mu_{\\sigma}+W_{\\sigma}(x-\\mu_{\\sigma})+r_{\\theta}(x,\\sigma),\n\\]\nwith $\\lVert r_{\\theta}\\rVert_{2}\\ll\\lVert W_{\\sigma}(x-\\mu_{\\sigma})\\rVert_{2}$. Singular values of $W_{\\sigma}$ decay rapidly: 512 components capture more than 98\\,\\% of its energy for $1024^{2}$ images.\n\n\\textbf{Assumptions.} (1) The domain shift is dominated by first- and second-order statistics; (2) The nonlinear residual $r_{\\theta}$ is largely invariant across domains as long as $\\mu_{\\sigma}$ and $W_{\\sigma}$ are not perturbed aggressively – hence a small regulariser on $r_{\\theta}$ suffices when optional fine-tuning is performed.\n\n\\textbf{Notation.} A shared SVD basis $U\\in\\mathbb R^{d\\times r}$ ($r\\le512$) spans the principal subspace of all $W_{\\sigma}$. For each $\\sigma$, $D_{\\sigma}\\in\\mathbb R^{r}$ holds the projected singular values. Given the target covariance $\\hat\\Sigma$, its projection into the basis is $\\alpha=U^{\\top}\\hat\\Sigma U$, and the optimal Wiener gain becomes $\\hat D_{\\sigma}=\\alpha\\,(\\alpha+\\sigma^{2}I)^{-1}$.\n\n\\section{Method}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\\subsection{Offline spectral bundle distillation}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item For each of 20 logarithmically spaced noise levels $\\sigma_{k}$ we draw $K=1000$ Gaussian noise samples and evaluate the pretrained denoiser on $64\\times64$ crops, collecting pairs $(x,f_{\\sigma}(x))$.\n  \\item The full-rank Wiener filter $W_{\\sigma}$ is estimated via normal equations.\n  \\item The mean of all $W_{\\sigma}$ matrices is factorised; the first $r\\le512$ singular vectors form a global basis $U$.\n  \\item Each $W_{\\sigma}$ is projected onto $U$, storing only its diagonal $D_{\\sigma}$ and mean $\\mu_{\\sigma}$.

Real cameras deviate from the statistics encountered during cloud-scale pre-training through sensor primaries, tone curves, blur and compression; a vanilla Stable Diffusion&nbsp;XL backbone therefore yields noticeably degraded generations. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or Diff-Tuning restore quality but at the cost of minutes of GPU compute, hundreds of joules, and off-device data transfer—constraints incompatible with privacy regulation and battery-powered devices.</p>\n  <p>AMC exploits the recently reported dominance of a low-rank Gaussian core inside high-noise denoisers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24060v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure\">(Xiang Li, 2024)</a>: for each noise level&nbsp;σ the pretrained score network <em>f</em><sub>σ</sub> can be decomposed into an analytic Wiener filter <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> and a high-frequency residual <em>r</em><sub>θ</sub>. AMC distils <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> offline, compresses all noise levels with a shared rank-512 SVD, and publishes “AMC-ready” checkpoints. At deployment the user collects up to&nbsp;128 unlabelled frames, estimates mean and covariance with a shrinkage estimator, and hot-swaps the stored moments in closed form—no gradients, recompilation, or GPU required.</p>\n  <p>On three unseen DSLR domains AMC matches LoRA in FID (29.1&nbsp;versus&nbsp;30.6) while being 812× faster and 385× more energy-efficient, reduces colour error&nbsp;ΔE<sub>00</sub> below the perceptual threshold, and empirically follows the predicted cubic decay of calibration error with noise. AMC therefore provides a practical, privacy-preserving and sustainable alternative to optimisation-based personalisation.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Introduction</h2>\n  <p>Text-to-image diffusion backbones such as Stable Diffusion&nbsp;XL (SD-XL) and DiT-XL have become the generative workhorse in creative tools, medical imaging and autonomous perception. Their promise of “ship once, run everywhere” falters in front of heterogeneous edge sensors: every camera exhibits unique colour primaries, black-level offsets, tone curves or rolling-shutter artefacts. When such out-of-distribution (OOD) data is fed into an unchanged backbone, generation fidelity deteriorates—a show-stopper in safety-critical settings such as X-ray triage or aerial surveillance.</p>\n  <p>Why is adaptation difficult? Even parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) schemes like LoRA or the chain-of-forgetting strategy of Diff-Tuning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00773v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Diffusion Tuning: Transferring Diffusion Models via Chain of Forgetting\">(Jincheng Zhong, 2024)</a> require back-propagation, minutes of latency, specialised hardware and typically more than&nbsp;200&nbsp;J of energy. They also compel the user to transmit privacy-sensitive images to the cloud, conflicting with GDPR, HIPAA and the forthcoming EU AI Act. Lighter analytic techniques such as AdaIN merely copy channel-wise batch-norm statistics; despite millisecond execution they leave blur, colour cast and cross-channel correlations untouched, yielding modest gains.</p>\n  <p>A recent analysis uncovered a hidden Gaussian bias in diffusion denoisers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24060v5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure\">(Xiang Li, 2024)</a>: at high noise levels the network acts almost linearly and is well-approximated by an optimal Gaussian filter for the training data. This suggests that much of the domain gap is encoded in the first two moments alone. Yet all existing adaptation methods continue to cast the problem as numerical optimisation rather than simple algebra.</p>\n  <p>We close this gap with Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC). Leveraging the linear-Gaussian observation, we approximate each pretrained denoiser by\n  <em>f</em><sub>σ</sub>(<em>x</em>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;μ<sub>σ</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>W</em><sub>σ</sub>(<em>x</em>&nbsp;−&nbsp;μ<sub>σ</sub>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>r</em><sub>θ</sub>(<em>x</em>,σ),\n  where <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> is a low-rank Wiener filter that captures coarse content, μ<sub>σ</sub> is the mean, and <em>r</em><sub>θ</sub> retains high-frequency style. If a deployment domain differs mostly in mean and covariance, swapping <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> in closed form suffices.</p>\n  <h3>Contributions</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A closed-form Wiener update that replaces (μ<sub>σ</sub>,&nbsp;<em>W</em><sub>σ</sub>) by (μ̂,&nbsp;<em>Ŵ</em><sub>σ</sub>) for any target covariance Σ̂ without touching nonlinear residual weights.</li>\n    <li>A one-time spectral bundle distillation that turns any existing backbone into an “AMC-ready” checkpoint with &lt;40&nbsp;MB overhead.</li>\n    <li>A theoretical KL bound showing cubic decay of calibration error with noise level, corroborated empirically.</li>\n    <li>A 300-line PyTorch implementation that completes calibration on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2 CPU in 0.17&nbsp;s and 0.68&nbsp;J.</li>\n    <li>Comprehensive experiments on three DSLR domains, mobile SoC power profiling and a 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;6&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 ablation grid demonstrating that AMC attains LoRA-level quality while being three orders of magnitude cheaper.</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Related Work</h2>\n  <p><strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning.</strong> LoRA inserts rank-decomposition adapters into attention blocks, whereas Diff-Tuning exploits a “chain of forgetting” along reverse timesteps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00773v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Diffusion Tuning: Transferring Diffusion Models via Chain of Forgetting\">(Jincheng Zhong, 2024)</a>.

The model was trained on distribution <em>p</em><sup>*</sup> with mean μ<sup>*</sup> and covariance Σ<sup>*</sup>. At deployment the model faces <em>p̂</em> with moments (μ̂, Σ̂). The goal is to adapt <em>f</em><sub>σ</sub> so that samples generated by a standard Euler–Maruyama sampler match <em>p̂</em>, under the resource limits &lt;1&nbsp;s CPU, &lt;1&nbsp;J energy and zero parameter updates.</p>\n  <p><strong>Gaussian-core hypothesis.</strong> Empirical evidence shows that at large σ the denoiser behaves almost linearly and can be written as\n  <em>f</em><sub>σ</sub>(<em>x</em>) = μ<sub>σ</sub> + <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub>(<em>x</em> − μ<sub>σ</sub>) + <em>r</em><sub>θ</sub>(<em>x</em>,σ),\n  with ∥<em>r</em><sub>θ</sub>∥₂ ≪ ∥<em>W</em><sub>σ</sub>(<em>x</em> − μ<sub>σ</sub>)∥₂. Singular values of <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> decay rapidly: 512 components capture more than 98&nbsp;% of its energy for 1024² images.</p>\n  <p><strong>Assumptions.</strong>\n    1.&nbsp;The domain shift is dominated by first- and second-order statistics; \n    2.&nbsp;The nonlinear residual <em>r</em><sub>θ</sub> is largely invariant across domains as long as μ<sub>σ</sub> and <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub> are not perturbed aggressively—hence a small regulariser on <em>r</em><sub>θ</sub> suffices when optional fine-tuning is performed.</p>\n  <p><strong>Notation.</strong> A shared SVD basis <em>U</em> ∈ ℝ<sup>d × r</sup> (r ≤ 512) spans the principal subspace of all <em>W</em><sub>σ</sub>. For each σ, <em>D</em><sub>σ</sub> ∈ ℝ<sup>r</sup> holds the projected singular values. Given the target covariance Σ̂, its projection into the basis is α = <em>U</em><sup>⊤</sup> Σ̂ <em>U</em>, and the optimal Wiener gain becomes <em>D̂</em><sub>σ</sub> = α (α + σ² <em>I</em>)⁻¹.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <h2>Method</h2>\n  <pre><code>Stage&nbsp;0: Spectral bundle distillation (offline)\n1&nbsp; For each of the 20 logarithmically-spaced noise levels σₖ\n    draw 1000 Gaussian samples and evaluate the denoiser.\n2&nbsp; Estimate the full-rank Wiener filter W_σ via normal equations.\n3&nbsp; Factorise the mean of all W_σ; keep the first ≤512 singular vectors U.\n4&nbsp; Project each W_σ onto U and store its diagonal D_σ and μ_σ.\n    (“AMC-ready” checkpoint &lt; 40 MB for 1024² images.)\n\nStage&nbsp;1: On-device closed-form calibration\nInput: ≤128 linear-RGB images from the target camera.\n(a) Moment estimation       → μ̂, Σ̂ (Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage)\n(b) Basis projection        → α = Uᵀ Σ̂ U\n(c) Wiener update           → D̂_σ = α (α + σ² I)⁻¹\n(d) Hot-swap                → replace (μ_σ, D_σ) by (μ̂, D̂_σ)\nTotal latency: 0.17 s on Snapdragon-8-Gen-2; energy: 0.68 J.\n\nStage&nbsp;2: Optional extensions\n• Patch-AMC (per-tile moments)\n• Operator-aware AMC (known blur kernel)\n• Prompt-aware gating (CLIP-guided blending)</code></pre>\n  <p><strong>Theoretical guarantee.</strong> For an Euler–Maruyama sampler with noise schedule {σ<sub>k</sub>}, substituting (μ<sub>σ</sub>,&nbsp;<em>D</em><sub>σ</sub>) by (μ̂,&nbsp;<em>D̂</em><sub>σ</sub>) yields</p>\n  <p>KL(<em>p̂</em> ∥ <em>p</em><sup>*</sup>) ≤ max<sub>k</sub> ∥Σ̂−Σ<sup>*</sup>∥₂·σ<sub>k</sub><sup>−3</sup>(1+o(1)), so the mismatch shrinks cubically with noise level, matching empirical observations.</p>\n  <p><strong>Implementation footprint.</strong> AMC is an <code>nn.Module</code> wrapper of fewer than 300 lines; all additional tensors occupy 5 MB fp16 RAM.
