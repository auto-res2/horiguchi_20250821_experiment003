Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2208.09392v1  [cs.CV]  19 Aug 20221 Introduction Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling [Ramesh et al., 2022]. Diffusion models come in many ﬂavors, but all are built around the concept of random noise removal; one trains an image restoration/denoising network that accepts an image contaminated with Gaussian noise, and outputs a denoised image. At test time, the denoising network is used to convert pure Gaussian noise into a photo-realistic image using an update rule that alternates between applying the denoiser and adding Gaussian noise. When the right sequence of updates is applied, complex generative behavior is observed. The origins of diffusion models, and also our theoretical understanding of these models, are strongly based on the role played by Gaussian noise during training and generation. Diffusion has been understood as a random walk around the image density function using Langevin dynamics [Sohl- Dickstein et al., 2015, Song and Ermon, 2019], which requires Gaussian noise in each step. The walk begins in a high temperature (heavy noise) state, and slowly anneals into a “cold” state with little if any noise. Another line of work derives the loss for the denoising network using variational inference with a Gaussian prior [Ho et al., 2020, Song et al., 2021a, Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021]. In this work, we examine the need for Gaussian noise, or any randomness at all, for diffusion models to work in practice. We consider generalized diffusion models that live outside the conﬁnes of the theoretical frameworks from which diffusion models arose. Rather than limit ourselves to models built around Gaussian noise, we consider models built around arbitrary image transformations like blurring, downsampling, etc. We train a restoration network to invert these deformations using a simple ℓp loss. When we apply a sequence of updates at test time that alternate between the image restoration model and the image degradation operation, generative behavior emerges, and we obtain photo-realistic images. The existence of cold diffusions that require no Gaussian noise (or any randomness) during training or testing raises questions about the limits of our theoretical understanding of diffusion models. It also unlocks the door for potentially new types of generative models with very different properties than conventional diffusion seen so far. 2 Background Generative models exist for a range of modalities spanning natural language [Brown et al., 2020] and images [Brock et al., 2019, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021], and they can be extended to solve important problems such as image restoration [Kawar et al., 2021a, 2022]. While GANs [Goodfellow et al., 2014] have historically been the tool of choice for image synthesis [Brock et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2019], diffusion models [Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015] have recently become competitive if not superior for some applications [Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Nichol et al., 2021, Ramesh et al., 2021, Meng et al., 2021]. Both the Langevin dynamics and variational inference interpretations of diffusion models rely on properties of the Gaussian noise used in the training and sampling pipelines. From the score-matching generative networks perspective [Song and Ermon, 2019, Song et al., 2021b], noise in the training process is critically thought to expand the support of the low-dimensional training distribution to a set of full measure in ambient space. The noise is also thought to act as data augmentation to improve score predictions in low density regions, allowing for mode mixing in the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampling. The gradient signal in low-density regions can be further improved during sampling by injecting large magnitudes of noise in the early steps of SGLD and gradually reducing this noise in later stages. Kingma et al. [2021] propose a method to learn a noise schedule that leads to faster optimization. Using a classic statistical result, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli [2021] show the connection between removing additive Gaussian noise and the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density in determin- istic linear inverse problems. Here, we shed light on the role of noise in diffusion models through theoretical and empirical results in applications to inverse problems and image generation. Iterative neural models have been used for various inverse problems [Romano et al., 2016, Metzler et al., 2017]. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to them [Song et al., 2021b] for the 2problems of deblurring, denoising, super-resolution, and compressive sensing [Whang et al., 2021, Kawar et al., 2021b, Saharia et al., 2021, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli, 2021]. Although not their focus, previous works on diffusion models have included experiments with deterministic image generation [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021] and in selected inverse problems [Kawar et al., 2022]. Here, we show deﬁnitively that noise is not a necessity in diffusion models, and we observe the effects of removing noise for a number of inverse problems. Despite proliﬁc work on generative models in recent years, methods to probe the properties of learned distributions and measure how closely they approximate the real training data are by no means closed ﬁelds of investigation. Indirect feature space similarity metrics such as Inception Score [Salimans et al., 2016], Mode Score [Che et al., 2016], Frechet inception distance (FID) [Heusel et al., 2017], and Kernel inception distance (KID) [Bi´nkowski et al., 2018] have been proposed and adopted to some extent, but they have notable limitations [Barratt and Sharma, 2018]. To adopt a popular frame of reference, we will use FID as the feature similarity metric for our experiments. 3 Generalized Diffusion Standard diffusion models are built around two components. First, there is an image degradation operator that contaminates images with Gaussian noise. Second, a trained restoration operator is created to perform denoising. The image generation process alternates between the application of these two operators. In this work, we consider the construction of generalized diffusions built around arbitrary degradation operations. These degradations can be randomized (as in the case of standard diffusion) or deterministic. 3.1 Model components and training Given an image x0 ∈RN, consider the degradation of x0 by operator Dwith severity t,denoted xt = D(x0,t). The output distribution D(x0,t) of the degradation should vary continuously in t, and the operator should satisfy D(x0,0) = x0. In the standard diffusion framework, Dadds Gaussian noise with variance proportional to t. In our generalized formulation, we choose Dto perform various other transformations such as blurring, masking out pixels, downsampling, and more, with severity that depends on t. We explore a range of choices for Din Section 4. We also require a restoration operator R that (approximately) inverts D. This operator has the property that R(xt,t) ≈x0. In practice, this operator is implemented via a neural network parameterized by θ. The restoration network is trained via the minimization problem min θ Ex∼X∥Rθ(D(x,t),t) −x∥, (1) where xdenotes a random image sampled from distribution Xand ∥·∥ denotes a norm, which we take to be ℓ1 in our experiments. We have so far used the subscript Rθ to emphasize the dependence of Ron θduring training, but we will omit this symbol for simplicity in the discussion below. 3.2 Sampling from the model After choosing a degradation Dand training a model Rto perform the restoration, these operators can be used in tandem to invert severe degradations by using standard methods borrowed from the diffusion literature. For small degradations (t≈0), a single application of Rcan be used to obtain a restored image in one shot. However, because Ris typically trained using a simple convex loss, it yields blurry results when used with large t. Rather, diffusion models [Song et al., 2021a, Ho et al., 2020] perform generation by iteratively applying the denoising operator and then adding noise back to the image, with the level of added noise decreasing over time. This corresponds to the standard update sequence in Algorithm 1. 3Algorithm 1 Naive Sampling Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = D(ˆx0,s −1) end for Return: x0 Algorithm 2 Improved Sampling for Cold Diffusion Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = xs −D(ˆx0,s) + D(ˆx0,s −1) end for When the restoration operator is perfect, i.e. when R(D(x0,t),t) = x0 for all t,one can easily see that Algorithm 1 produces exact iterates of the form xs = D(x0,s). But what happens for imperfect restoration op- erators? In this case, errors can cause the iterates xs to wander away from D(x0,s), and inaccurate reconstruction may occur. We ﬁnd that the standard sampling ap- proach in Algorithm 1 works well for noise-based diffusion, possibly because the restoration operator R has been trained to correct (random Gaussian) errors in its inputs. However, we ﬁnd that it yields poor results in the case of cold diffusions with smooth/differentiable degradations as demonstrated for a deblurring model in Figure 2. We propose Algorithm 2 for sampling, which we ﬁnd to be superior for inverting smooth, cold degradations. This sampler has important mathematical properties that enable it to recover high quality results. Speciﬁcally, for a class of linear degradation operations, it can be shown to produce exact reconstruc- tion (i.e. xs = D(x0,s)) even when the restoration operator Rfails to perfectly invert D. We discuss this in the following section. 3.3 Properties of Algorithm 2 Figure 2: Comparison of sampling methods for cold diffusion on the CelebA dataset. Top: Algorithm 1 produces compounding artifacts and fails to generate a new image. Bottom: Algorithm 2 succeeds in sam- pling a high quality image without noise. It is clear from inspection that both Algo- rithms 1 and 2 perfectly reconstruct the it- erate xs = D(x0,s) for all s < tif the restoration operator is a perfect inverse for the degradation operator. In this section, we analyze the stability of these algorithms to errors in the restoration operator. For small values of xand s, Algorithm 2 is extremely tolerant of error in the restoration operator R. To see why, consider a model problem with a linear degradation function of the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·efor some vector e. While this ansatz may seem rather restrictive, note that the Taylor expansion of any smooth degradation D(x,s) around x = x0,s = 0 has the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·e+ HOT where HOT denotes higher order terms. Note that the constant/zeroth-order term in this Taylor expansion is zero because we assumed above that the degradation operator satisﬁes D(x,0) = x. For a degradation of the form (3.3) and any restoration operator R, the update in Algorithm 2 can be written xs−1 = xs −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = D(x0,s) −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = x0 + s·e−R(xs,s) −s·e+ R(xs,s) + (s−1) ·e = x0 + (s−1) ·e = D(x0,s −1) By induction, we see that the algorithm produces the value xs = D(x0,s) for all s<t, regardless of the choice of R. In other words, for any choice of R, the iteration behaves the same as it would when Ris a perfect inverse for the degradation D. By contrast, Algorithm 1 does not enjoy this behavior. In fact, when Ris not a perfect inverse for D, x0 is not even a ﬁxed point of the update rule in Algorithm 1 becausex0 ̸= D(R(x,0),0) = R(x,0). If Rdoes not perfectly invert Dwe should expect Algorithm 1 to incur errors, even for small values 4of s. Meanwhile, for small values of s, the behavior of Dapproaches its ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion and Algorithm 2 becomes immune to errors in R. We demonstrate the stability of Algorithm 2 vs Algorithm 1 on a deblurring model in Figure 2. 4 Generalized Diffusions with Various Transformations In this section, we take the ﬁrst step towards cold diffusion by reversing different degradations and hence performing conditional generation. We will extend our methods to perform unconditional (i.e. from scratch) generation in Section 5. We emprically evaluate generalized diffusion models trained on different degradations with our improved sampling Algorithm 2. We perform experiments on the vision tasks of deblurring, inpainting, super-resolution, and the unconventional task of synthetic snow removal. We perform our experiments on MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], CIFAR-10 [Krizhevsky, 2009], and CelebA [Liu et al., 2015]. In each of these tasks, we gradually remove the information from the clean image, creating a sequence of images such that D(x0,t) retains less information than D(x0,t −1). For these different tasks, we present both qualitative and quantitative results on a held-out testing dataset and demonstrate the importance of the sampling technique described in Algorithm 2. For all quantitative results in this section, the Frechet inception distance (FID) scores [Heusel et al., 2017] for degraded and reconstructed images are measured with respect to the testing data. Additional information about the quantitative results, convergence criteria, hyperparameters, and architecture of the models presented below can be found in the appendix. 4.1 Deblurring We consider a generalized diffusion based on a Gaussian blur operation (as opposed to Gaussian noise) in which an image at stepthas more blur than att−1. The forward process given the Gaussian kernels {Gs}and the image xt−1 at step t−1 can thus be written as xt = Gt ∗xt−1 = Gt ∗... ∗G1 ∗x0 = ¯Gt ∗x0 = D(x0,t), (2) where ∗denotes the convolution operator, which blurs an image using a kernel. We train a deblurring model by minimizing the loss (1), and then use Algorithm 2 to invert this blurred diffusion process for which we trained a DNN to predict the clean image ˆx0. Qualitative results are shown in Figure 3 and quantitative results in Table 1. Qualitatively, we can see that images created using the sampling process are sharper and in some cases completely different as compared to the direct reconstruction of the clean image. Quantitatively we can see that the reconstruction metrics such as RMSE and PSNR get worse when we use the sampling process, but on the other hand FID with respect to held-out test data improves. The qualitative improvements and decrease in FID show the beneﬁts of the generalized sampling routine, which brings the learned distribution closer to the true data manifold. In the case of blur operator, the sampling routine can be thought of adding frequencies at each step. This is because the sampling routine involves the term D( ˆx0,t) −D( ˆx0,t −1) which in the case of blur becomes ¯Gt ∗x0 −¯Gt−1 ∗x0. This results in a difference of Gaussians, which is a band pass ﬁlter and contains frequencies that were removed at step t. Thus, in the sampling process, we sequentially add the frequencies that were removed during the degradation process. Degraded Direct Alg.

We remove pixels using a Gaussian mask as follows: For input images of size n×nwe start with a 2D Gaussian curve of variance β,discretized into an n×narray. We normalize so the peak of the curve has value 1, and subtract the result from 1 so the center of the mask as value 0. We randomize the location of the Gaussian mask for MNIST and CIFAR-10, but keep it centered for CelebA. We denote the ﬁnal mask by zβ. Input images x0 are iteratively masked for T steps via multiplication with a sequence of masks {zβi } with increasing βi. We can control the amount of information removed at each step by tuning the βi parameter. In the language of Section 3, D(x0,t) = x0 ·∏t i=1 zβi , where the operator ·denotes entry-wise multiplication. Figure 4 presents results on test images and compares the output of the inpainting model to the original image. The reconstructed images display reconstructed features qualitatively consistent with the context provided by the unperturbed regions of the image. We quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the inpainting models on each of the datasets by comparing distributional similarity metrics before and after the reconstruction. Our results are summarized in Table 2. Note, the FID scores here are computed with respect to the held-out validation set.

This takes place, once for each values of t, until a ﬁnal resolution is reached, 4 ×4 in the case of MNIST and CIFAR-10 and 2 ×2 in the case of Celeb-A. After each down-sampling, the lower- resolution image is resized to the original image size, using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that generalized diffusion can succeed even with exotic transforms that lack the scale-space and compositional properties of blur operators. Similar to other tasks, we degrade the images by adding snow, such that the level of snow increases with step t. We provide more implementation details in Appendix. We illustrate our desnowiﬁcation results in Figure 6. We present testing examples, as well as their snowiﬁed images, from all the datasets, and compare the desnowiﬁed results with the original images. The desnowiﬁed images feature near-perfect reconstruction results for CIFAR-10 examples with lighter snow, and exhibit visually distinctive restoration for Celeb-A examples with heavy snow. We provide quantitative results in Table 4. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 6: Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets.

We will ﬁrst discuss deterministic generation using Gaussian noise 7Table 4: Quantitative metrics for quality of image reconstruction using desnowiﬁcation models.

Finally, we provide a proof of concept that the Algorithm 2 can be extended to other degradations. 5.1 Generation using deterministic noise degradation Here we discuss image generation using noise-based degradation. We consider “deterministic” sampling in which the noise pattern is selected and frozen at the start of the generation process, and then treated as a constant. We study two ways of applying Algorithm 2 with ﬁxed noise. We ﬁrst deﬁne D(x,t) = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz, as the (deterministic) interpolation between data point xand a ﬁxed noise pattern z∈N(0,1), for increasing αt <αt−1, ∀1 ≤t≤T as in Song et al. [2021a]. Algorithm 2 can be applied in this case by ﬁxing the noise zused in the degradation operatorD(x,s). Alternatively, one can deterministically calculate the noise vector zto be used in step tof reconstruction by using the formula ˆz(xt,t) = xt −√αtR(xt,t)√1 −αt . The second method turns out to be closely related to the deterministic sampling proposed in Song et al. [2021a], with some differences in the formulation of the training objective. We discuss this relationship in detail in Appendix A.6. We present quantitative results for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using the ﬁxed noise method and the estimated noise method (using ˆz) in Table 5. 5.2 Image generation using blur The forward diffusion process in noise-based diffusion models has the advantage that the degraded image distribution at the ﬁnal step T is simply an isotropic Gaussian. One can therefore perform (unconditional) generation by ﬁrst drawing a sample from the isotropic Gaussian, and sequentially denoising it with backward diffusion. When using blur as a degradation, the fully degraded images do not form a nice closed-form distribution that we can sample from. They do, however, form a simple enough distribution that can be modeled with simple methods. Note that every image x0 degenerates to an xT that is constant (i.e., every pixel is the same color) for largeT. Furthermore, the constant value is exactly the channel-wise mean of the RGB image x0, and can be represented with a 3-vector. This 3-dimensional distribution is easily represented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). This GMM can be sampled to produce the random pixel values of a severely blurred image, which can be deblurred using cold diffusion to create a new image. Our generative model uses a blurring schedule where we progressively blur each image with a Gaussian kernel of size 27x27 over 300 steps. The standard deviation of the kernel starts at 1 and increases exponentially at the rate of 0.01. We then ﬁt a simple GMM with one component to the distribution of channel-wise means. To generate an image from scratch, we sample the channel-wise mean from the GMM, expand the 3D vector into a 128 ×128 image with three channels, and then apply Algorithm 2. Empirically, the presented pipeline generates images with high ﬁdelity but low diversity, as reﬂected quantitatively by comparing the perfect symmetry column with results from hot diffusion in Table 5. We attribute this to the perfect correlation between pixels of xT sampled from the channel-wise mean Gaussian mixture model. To break the symmetry between pixels, we add a small amount of Gaussian noise (of standard deviation 0.002) to each sampled xT. As shown in Table 5, the simple trick drastically improves the quality of generated images. We also present the qualitative results for cold diffusion using blur transformation in Figure 7, and further discuss the necessity of Algorithm 2 8for generation in Appendix A.7. Table 5: FID scores for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using hot (using noise) and cold diffusion (using blur transformation). This table shows that This table also shows that breaking the symmetry withing pixels of the same channel further improves the FID scores.

Speciﬁcally, we show preliminary results on inpainting, super-resolution, and animorphosis. Inspired by the simplicity of the degraded image distribution for the blurring routine presented in the previous section, we use degradation routines with predictable ﬁnal distributions here as well. To use the Gaussian mask transformation for generation, we modify the masking routine so the ﬁnal degraded image is completely devoid of information. One might think a natural option is to send all of the images to a completely black image xT, but this would not allow for any diversity in generation. To get around this maximally non-injective property, we instead make the mask turn all pixels to a random, solid color. This still removes all of the information from the image, but it allows us to recover different samples from the learned distribution via Algorithm 2 by starting off with different color images. More formally, a Gaussian mask Gt = ∏t i=1 zβi is created in a similar way as discussed in the Section 4.2, but instead of multiplying it directly to the image x0, we create xt as follows: xt = Gt ∗x0 + (1 −Gt) ∗c where cis an image of a randomly sampled color. For super-resolution, the routine down-samples to a resolution of 2 ×2, or 4 values in each channel. These degraded images can be represented as one-dimensional vectors, and their distribution is modeled using one Gaussian distribution. Using the same methods described for generation using 9blurring described above, we sample from this Gaussian-ﬁtted distribution of the lower-dimensional degraded image space and pass this sampled point through the generation process trained on super- resolution data to create one output. Additionally to show one can invert nearly any transformation, we include a new transformation deemed animorphosis, where we iteratively transform a human face from CelebA to an animal face from AFHQ. Though we chose CelebA and AFHQ for our experimentation, in principle such interpolation can be done for any two initial data distributions. More formally, given an image xand a random image zsampled from the AFHQ manifold, xt can be written as follows: xt = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz Note this is essentially the same as the noising procedure, but instead of adding noise we are adding a progressively higher weighted AFHQ image. In order to sample from the learned distribution, we sample a random image of an animal and use Algorithm 2 to reverse theanimorphosis transformation. We present results for the CelebA dataset, and hence the quantitative results in terms of FID scores for inpainting, super-resolution and animorphosis are 90.14, 92.91 and 48.51 respectively. We further show some qualitative samples in Figure 8, and in Figure 1. Figure 8: Preliminary demonstration of the generative abilities of other cold diffusins on the128×128 CelebA dataset. The top row is with animorphosis models, the middle row is with inpainting models, and the bottom row exhibits super-resolution models. 6 Conclusion Existing diffusion models rely on Gaussian noise for both forward and reverse processes. In this work, we ﬁnd that the random noise can be removed entirely from the diffusion model framework, and replaced with arbitrary transforms. In doing so, our generalization of diffusion models and their sampling procedures allows us to restore images afﬂicted by deterministic degradations such as blur, inpainting and downsampling. This framework paves the way for a more diverse landscape of diffusion models beyond the Gaussian noise paradigm. The different properties of these diffusions may prove useful for a range of applications, including image generation and beyond. References Shane Barratt and Rishi Sharma.

LOGAN: latent optimisation for generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00953, 2019. 12A Appendix A.1 Deblurring For the deblurring experiments, we train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The training was done on the batch size of 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995 which is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For the MNIST dataset, we blur recursively 40 times, with a discrete Gaussian kernel of size 11x11 and a standard deviation 7. In the case of CIFAR-10, we recursively blur with a Gaussian kernel of ﬁxed size 11x11, but at each step t, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is given by 0.01 ∗t+ 0.35. The blur routine for CelebA dataset involves blurring images with a Gaussian kernel of 15x15 and the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel grows exponentially with time tat the rate of 0.01. Figure 9 shows an additional nine images for each of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Figures 19 and 20 show the iterative sampling process using a deblurring model for ten example images from each dataset. We further show 400 random images to demonstrate the qualitative results in the Figure 21. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 9: Additional examples from deblurring models trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. A.2 Inpainting For the inpainting transformation, models were trained on different datasets with 60,000 gradient steps. The models were trained using Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2×10−5. We use batch size 64, and the gradients are accumulated after every 2 steps. The ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. This EMA model is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For all our inpainting experiments we use a randomized Gaussian mask and T = 50 with β1 = 1 and βi+1 = βi + 0.1. To avoid potential leakage of information due to ﬂoating point computation of the Gaussian mask, we discretize the masked image before passing it through the inpainting model. This was done by rounding all pixel values to the eight most signiﬁcant digits. 13Figure 11 shows nine additional inpainting examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 10 demonstrates an example of the iterative sampling process of an inpainting model for one image in each dataset. A.3 Super-Resolution We train the super-resolution model per Section 3.1 for 700,000 iterations. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The batch size is 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. The number of time-steps depends on the size of the input image and the ﬁnal image. For MNIST and for CIFAR10, the number of time steps is 3, as it takes three steps of halving the resolution to reduce the initial image down to 4 ×4. For CelebA, the number of time steps is 6 to reduce the initial image down to 2 ×2. For CIFAR10, we apply random crop and random horizontal ﬂip for regularization. Figure 13 shows an additional nine super-resolution examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 12 shows one example of the progressive increase in resolution achieved with the sampling process using a super-resolution model for each dataset. A.4 Colorization Here we provide results for the additional task of colorization. Starting with the original RGB- image x0, we realize colorization by iteratively desaturating for T steps until the ﬁnal image xT is a fully gray-scale image. We use a series of three-channel 1 ×1 convolution ﬁlters z(α) = {z1(α),z2(α),z3(α)}with the form z1(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (1 0 0) z2(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 1 0) z3(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 0 1) and obtain D(x,t) = z(αt) ∗xvia a schedule deﬁned as α1,...,α t for each respective step. Notice that a gray image is obtained when xT = z(1) ∗x0. We can tune the ratio αt to control the amount of information removed in each step. For our experiment, we schedule the ratio such that for every twe have xt = z(αt) ∗... ∗z(α1) ∗x0 = z( t T) ∗x0. This schedule ensures that color information lost between steps is smaller in earlier stage of the diffusion and becomes larger as tincreases. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 50 and for CelebA we use T = 20.

Figure 12: Progressive upsampling of selected downsampled MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA images. The original image is at the left for each of these progressive upsamplings. We illustrate our recolorization results in Figure 14. We present testing examples, as well as their grey scale images, from all the datasets, and compare the recolorization results with the original images. The recolored images feature correct color separation between different regions, and feature various and yet semantically correct colorization of objects. Our sampling technique still yields minor differences in comparison to the direct reconstruction, although the change is not visually apparent. We attribute this to the shape restriction of colorization task, as human perception is rather insensitive to minor color change. We also provide quantitative measurement for the effectiveness of our recolorization results in terms of different similarity metrics, and summarize the results in Table 6.

A.5 Image Snow Here we provide results for the additional task of snowiﬁcation, which is a direct adaptation of the ofﬁcal implementation of ImageNet-C snowiﬁcation process [Hendrycks and Dietterich, 2019]. To determine the snow pattern of a given image x0 ∈RC×H×W, we ﬁrst construct a seed matrix SA ∈RH×W where each entry is sampled from a Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ). The upper-left corner of SA is then zoomed into another matrix SB ∈RH×W with spline interpolation. Next, we create a new matrix SC by ﬁltering each value of SB with a given threshold c1 as SC[i][j] = {0, S B[i][j] ≤c1 SB[i][j], S B[i][j] >c1 and clip each entry of SC into the range [0,1]. We then convolve SC using a motion blur kernel with standard deviation c2 to create the snow pattern Sand its up-side-down rotation S′. The direction of the motional blur kernel is randomly chosen as either vertical or horizontal. The ﬁnal snow image is 16created by again clipping each value of x0 + S+ S′into the range [0,1]. For simplicity, we abstract the process as a function h(x0,SA,c0,c1). Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 15: Additional examples from Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. To create a series ofT images with increasing snowiﬁcation, we linearly interpolatec0 and c1 between [cstart 0 ,cend 0 ] and [cstart 1 ,cend 1 ] respectively, to create c0(t) and c1(t), t= 1,...,T . Then for each x0, a seed matrix Sx is sampled, the motion blur direction is randomized, and we construct each related xt by xt = h(x0,Sx,c0(t),c1(t)). Visually, c0(t) dictates the severity of the snow, while c1(t) determines how “windy\" the snowiﬁed image seems. For both CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A, we use the same Gaussian distribution with parameters µ= 0.55 and σ = 0 .3 to generate the seed matrix. For CIFAR-10, we choose cstart 0 = 1 .15, cend 0 = 0 .7, cstart 1 = 0 .05 and cend 1 = 16 , which generates a visually lighter snow. For Celeb-A, we choose cstart 0 = 1.15, cend 0 = 0.55, cstart 1 = 0.05 and cend 1 = 20, which generates a visually heavier snow. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 200 and for CelebA we use T = 200. We note that the seed matrix is resampled for each individual training batch, and hence the snow pattern varies across the training stage. A.6 Generation using noise : Further Details Here we will discuss in further detail on the similarity between the sampling method proposed in Algorithm 2 and the deterministic sampling in DDIM [Song et al., 2021a]. Given the image xt at step t, we have the restored clean image ˆx0 from the diffusion model. Hence given the estimated ˆx0 and xt, we can estimate the noise z(xt,t) (or ˆz) as z(xt,t) = xt −√αt ˆx0√1 −αt , Thus, the D( ˆx0,t) and D( ˆx0,t −1) can be written as D( ˆx0,t) = √αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz, D( ˆx0,t −1) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz, using which the sampling process in Algorithm 2 to estimate xt−1 can be written as, 17xt−1 = xt −D( ˆx0,t) + D( ˆx0,t −1) = xt −(√αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz) + (√αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz (3) which is same as the sampling method as described in [Song et al., 2021a]. A.7 Generation using blur transformation: Further Details Figure 16: Examples of generated samples from 128×128 CelebA and AFHQ datasets using Method 2 with perfect symmetry. The Figure 16, shows the generation without breaking any symmetry within each channel are quite promising as well. Necessity of Algorithm 2: In the case of unconditional generation, we observe a marked superiority in quality of the sampled reconstruction using Algorithm 2 over any other method considered. For example, in the broken symmetry case, the FID of the directly reconstructed images is 257.69 for CelebA and 214.24 for AFHQ, which are far worse than the scores of 49.45 and 54.68 from Table 5. In Figure 17, we also give a qualitative comparison of this difference. We can also clearly see from Figure 18 that Algorithm 1, the method used in Song et al. [2021b] and Ho et al. [2020], completely fails to produce an image close to the target data distribution. 18Figure 17: Comparison of direct reconstruction with sampling using Algorithm 2 for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry. Left-hand column is the initial cold images generated using the simple Gaussian model. Middle column has images generated in one step (i.e. direct reconstruction). Right-hand column are the images sampled with Algorithm 2. We present results for both CelebA (top) and AFHQ (bottom) with resolution 128 ×128. Figure 18: Comparison of Algorithm 1 (top row) and Algorithm 2 (bottom row) for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry on 128 ×128 CelebA dataset. We demonstrate that Algorithm 1 fails completely to generate a new image. 19Figure 19: Progressive deblurring of selected blurred MNIST and CIFAR-10 images. 20Figure 20: Progressive deblurring of selected blurred CelebA images. 21Figure 21: Deblurred Cifar10 images 22",

We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding non- linear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Interestingly, these linear denoisers are nearly optimal for multivariate Gaussian distributions defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset, and they effectively approximate the behavior of nonlinear diffusion models. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model’s capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case where the model is highly overpa- rameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models. 1 Introduction In recent years, diffusion models [1–4] have become one of the leading generative models, powering the state-of-the-art image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion [5]. To understand the empirical success of diffusion models, several works [6–12] have focused on their sampling behavior, showing that the data distribution can be effectively estimated in the reverse sampling process, assuming that the score function is learned accurately. Meanwhile, other works [ 13–18] investigate the learning of score functions, showing that effective approximation can be achieved with score matching loss under certain assumptions. However, these theoretical insights, grounded in simplified assumptions about data distribution and neural network architectures, do not fully capture the complex dynamics of diffusion models in practical scenarios. One significant discrepancy between theory and practice is that real-world diffusion models are trained only on a finite number of data points. As argued in [19], theoretically a perfectly learned score function over the empirical data distribution can only replicate the training data. In contrast, diffusion models trained on finite samples exhibit remarkable generalizability, producing high-quality images that significantly differ from the training examples. Therefore, a good understanding of the remarkable generative power of diffusion models is still lacking. In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of generalizability in diffusion models by analyzing the inherent properties of the learned score functions. Essentially, the score functions can be interpreted as a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. These denoisers are then 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2410.24060v5  [cs.LG]  2 Dec 2024chained together to progressively denoise a randomly sampled Gaussian noise into its corresponding clean image, thus, understanding the function mappings of these diffusion denoisers is critical to demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Motivated by the linearity observed in the diffusion denoisers of effectively generalized diffusion models, we propose to elucidate their function mappings with a linear distillation approach, where the resulting linear models serve as the linear approximations of their nonlinear counterparts. Contributions of this work: Our key findings can be highlighted as follows: • Inductive bias towards Gaussian structures (Section 3). Diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close (but not equal) to the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training data. This implies the diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training data for image generation. • Model Capacity and Training Duration (Section 4) We show that this inductive bias is most pronounced when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of the training data. However, even if the model is highly overparameterized, such inductive bias still emerges during early training phases, before the model memorizes its training data. This implies that early stopping can prompt generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. • Connection between Strong Generalization and Gaussian Structure (Section 5). Lastly, we argue that the recently observed strong generalization [20] results from diffusion models learning certain common low-dimensional structural features shared across non-overlapping datasets. We show that such low-dimensional features can be partially explained through the Gaussian structure. Relationship with Prior Arts. Recent research [20–24] demonstrates that diffusion models operate in two distinct regimes: ( i) a memorization regime, where models primarily reproduce training samples and (ii) a generalization regime, where models generate high-quality, novel images that extend beyond the training data. In the generalization regime, a particularly intriguing phenomenon is that diffusion models trained on non-overlapping datasets can generate nearly identical samples [20]. While prior work [20] attributes this ”strong generalization” effect to the structural inductive bias inherent in diffusion models leading to the optimal denoising basis (geometry-adaptive harmonic basis), our research advances this understanding by demonstrating diffusion models’ inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure of the training data. Our findings also corroborate with observations of earlier study [25] that the learned score functions of well-trained diffusion models closely align with the optimal score functions of a multivariate Gaussian approximation of the training data. 2 Preliminary Basics of Diffusion Models. Given a data distribution pdata(x), where x ∈ Rd, diffusion mod- els [1–4] define a series of intermediate states p(x; σ(t)) by adding Gaussian noise sampled from N(0, σ(t)2I) to the data, where σ(t) is a predefined schedule that specifies the noise level at time t ∈ [0, T], such that at the end stage the noise mollified distribution p(x; σ(T)) is indistinguishable from the pure Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, a new sample is generated by progressively denoising a random noise xT ∼ N(0, σ(T)2I) to its corresponding clean image x0. Following [4], this forward and backward diffusion process can be expressed with a probabilistic ODE: dx = −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇x log p(x; σ(t))dt. (1) In practice the score function ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) can be approximated by ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) = (Dθ(x; σ(t)) − x)/σ(t)2, (2) where Dθ(x; σ(t)) is parameterized by a deep network with parameters θ trained with the denoising score matching objective: min θ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I) \u0002 ∥Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − x∥2 2 \u0003 . (3) In the discrete setting, the reverse ODE in (1) takes the following form: xi+1 ← (1 − (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti))xi + (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti)Dθ(xi; σ(ti)), (4) 2where x0 ∼ N(0, σ2(t0)I). Notice that at each iteration i, the intermediate sample xi+1 is the sum of the scaled xi and the denoising output Dθ(xi; σ(ti)). Obviously, the final sampled image is largely determined by the denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)). If we can understand the function mapping of these diffusion denoisers, we can demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Optimal Diffusion Denoisers under Simplified Data Assumptions. Under certain assumptions on the data distribution pdata(x), the optimal diffusion denoisers Dθ(x; σ(t)) that minimize the score matching objective (3) can be derived analytically in closed-forms as we discuss below. • Multi-delta distribution of the training data. Suppose the training dataset contains a finite number of data points {y1, y2, ...,yN }, a natural way to model the data distribution is to represent it as a multi-delta distribution: p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi). In this case, the optimal denoiser is DM(x; σ(t)) = PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I)yi PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I) , (5) which is essentially a softmax-weighted combination of the finite data points. As proved in [24], such diffusion denoisers DM(x; σ(t)) can only generate exact replicas of the training samples, therefore they have no generalizability. • Multivariate Gaussian distribution. Recent work [ 25] suggests modeling the data distribution pdata(x) as a multivariate Gaussian distribution p(x) = N(µ, Σ), where the mean µ and the co- variance Σ are approximated by the empirical mean µ = 1 N PN i=1 yi and the empirical covariance Σ = 1 N PN i=1(yi − µ)(yi − µ)T of the training dataset. In this case, the optimal denoiser is: DG(x; σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), (6) where Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values Λ = diag (λ1, ··· , λd) and ˜Λσ(t) = diag \u0010 λ1 λ1+σ(t)2 , ··· , λd λd+σ(t)2 \u0011 . With this linear Gaus- sian denoiser, as proved in [25], the sampling trajectory of the probabilistic ODE (1) has close form: xt = µ + dX i=1 s σ(t)2 + λi σ(T)2 + λi uT i (xT − µ)ui, (7) where ui is the ith singular vector of the empirical covariance matrix. While [ 25] demonstrate that the Gaussian scores approximate learned scores at high noise variances, we show that they are nearly the best linear approximations of learned scores across a much wider range of noise variances. Generalization vs. Memorization of Diffusion Models. As the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images [17]. While memorization can be interpreted as an overfitting of diffusion models to the training samples, the mechanisms underlying the generalization regime remain less well understood. This study aims to explore and elucidate the inductive bias that enables effective generalization in diffusion models. 3 Hidden Linear and Gaussian Structures in Diffusion Models In this section, we study the intrinsic structures of the learned score functions of diffusion models in the generalization regime. Through various experiments and theoretical investigation, we show that Diffusion models in the generalization regime have inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structures of the dataset. Based on the linearity observed in diffusion denoisers trained in the generalization regime, we propose to investigate their intrinsic properties through a linear distillation technique, with which we train a series of linear models to approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers (Section 3.1). Interestingly, these linear models closely resemble the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset (Section 3.2). This implies diffusion models have the inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structure of the 3training dataset. We theoretically show that the observed Gaussian structure is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the constraint that the model is linear (Section 3.3). In the subsequent sections, although we mainly demonstrate our results using the FFHQ datasets, our findings are robust and extend to various architectures and datasets, as detailed in Appendix G. 3.1 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime Our study is motivated by the emerging linearity observed in diffusion models in the generalization regime. Specifically, we quantify the linearity of diffusion denoisers at various noise levelσ(t) by jointly assessing their ”Additivity” and ”Homogeneity” with a linearity score (LS) defined by the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)): LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , where x1, x2 ∼ p(x; σ(t)), and α ∈ R and β ∈ R are scalars. In practice, the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 samples. A more detailed discussion on this choice of measuring linearity is deferred to Appendix A. Figure 1: Linearity scores of diffusion denoisers. Solid and dashed lines depict the linearity scores across noise variances for models in the general- ization and memorization regimes, respectively, where α = β = 1/ √ 2. Following the EDM training configuration [4], we set the noise levels σ(t) within the contin- uous range [0.002,80]. As shown in Figure 1, as diffusion models transition from the mem- orization regime to the generalization regime (increasing the training dataset size), the corre- sponding diffusion denoisers Dθ exhibit increas- ing linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets1 as well as various training con- figurations2; see Appendix B for more details. This emerging linearity motivates us to ask the following questions: • To what extent can a diffusion model be ap- proximated by a linear model? • If diffusion models can be approximated lin- early, what are the underlying characteristics of this linear approximation? Investigating the Linear Structures via Linear Distillation. To address these questions, we investigate the hidden linear structure of diffusion denoisers through linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiserDθ(x; σ(t)) at noise levelσ(t), we approximate it with a linear function (with a bias term) such that: DL(x; σ(t)) := Wσ(t)x + bσ(t) ≈ Dθ(x; σ(t)), ∀x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), (8) where the weight Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d and bias bσ(t) ∈ Rd are learned by solving the following optimiza- tion problem with gradient descent:3 min Wσ(t),bσ(t) Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||Wσ(t)(x + ϵ) + bσ(t) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))||2 2. (9) If these linear models effectively approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers, analyzing their weights can elucidate the generation mechanism. While diffusion models are trained on continuous noise variance levels within [0.002,80], we examine the 10 discrete sampling steps specified by the EDM schedule [4]: [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002] . These steps are considered sufficient for studying the diffusion mappings for two reasons: (i) images generated using these 10 steps closely match those generated 1For example, FFHQ [26], CIFAR-10 [27], AFHQ [28] and LSUN-Churches [29]. 2For example, EDM-VE, EDM-VP and EDM-ADM. 3For the following, the input is the vectorized version of the noisy image and the expectation is approximated using finite samples of input-output pairs (xi + ϵi, Dθ(xi + ϵ, σ(t))) with i = 1, ..., N(see distillation details in Appendix C). 4Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) Figure 2: Score field approximation error and sampling Trajectory. The left and right figures demonstrate the score field approximation error and the sampling trajectories D(xt; σ(t) of actual diffusion model (EDM), Multi-Delta model, linear model and Gaussian model respectively. Notice that the curve corresponding to the Gaussian model almost overlaps with that of the linear model, suggesting they share similar funciton mappings. with more steps, and (ii) recent research [30] demonstrates that the diffusion denoisers trained on similar noise variances exhibit analogous function mappings, implying that denoiser behavior at discrete variances represents their behavior at nearby variances. After obtaining the linear modelsDL, we evaluate their differences with the actual nonlinear denoisers Dθ with the score field approximation error, calculated using the expectation over the root mean square error (RMSE): Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) r ∥DL(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))∥2 2 d| {z } RMSE of a pair of randomly sampled x and ϵ , (10) where d represents the data dimension and the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean. While we present RMSE-based results in the main text, our findings remain consistent across alternative metrics, including NMSE, as detailed in Appendix G. We perform linear distillation on well trained diffusion models operating in the generalization regime. For comprehensive analysis, we also compute the score approximation error between Dθ and: (i) the optimal denoisers for the multi-delta distribution DM defined as (5), and (ii) the optimal denoisers for the multivariate Gaussian distribution DG defined as (6). As shown in Figure 2, our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [20,80]. In this regime, only coarse image structures are generated (Fig- ure 2(right)). Quantitatively, as shown in Figure 2(left), the distilled linear model DL closely approximates its nonlinear counterpart Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. Both Gaussian score DG and multi-delta score DM also achieve comparable approximation accuracy. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, only subtle, imperceptible details are added to the generated images. Here, both DL and DG effectively approximate Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,20]: This crucial regime, where realistic image content is primarily generated, exhibits significant nonlinearity. While DM exhibits high approximation error due to rapid convergence to training samples—a memorization effect theoretically proved in [24], both DL and DG maintain relatively lower approximation errors. Qualitatively, as shown in Figure 2(right), despite the relatively high score approximation error in the intermediate noise regime, the images generated with DL closely resemble those generated with Dθ in terms of the overall image structure and certain amount of fine details. This implies (i) the underlying linear structure within the nonlinear diffusion models plays a pivotal role in their generalization capabilities and (ii) such linear structure is effectively captured by our distilled linear models. In the next section, we will explore this linear structure by examining the linear models DL. 3.2 Inductive Bias towards Learning the Gaussian Structures Notably, the Gaussian denoisers DG exhibit behavior strikingly similar to the linear denoisers DL. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), they achieve nearly identical score approximation errors, particularly 5Correlation Matrices !0123456 ! ‖\"!(#)−$\t&'!#$2‖&/‖$7Λ!#$2‖& Figure 4: Linear model shares similar function mapping with Gaussian model.

The right figure shows the correlation matrices between the first 100 singular vectors of the linear weights and Gaussian weights. in the critical intermediate variance region. Furthermore, their sampling trajectories are remarkably similar (Figure 2(right)), producing nearly identical generated images that closely match those from the actual diffusion denoisers (Figure 3). These observations suggest that DL and DG share similar function mappings across various noise levels, leading us to hypothesize that the intrinsic linear structure underlying diffusion models corresponds to the Gaussian structure of the training data—specifically, its empirical mean and covariance. We validate this hypothesis by empirically showing that DL is close to DG through the following three complementary experiments: • Similarity in weight matrices. As illustrated in Figure 4(left), Wσ(t) progressively converge towards U ˜Λσ(t)UT throughout the linear distillation process, achieving small normalized MSE (less than 0.2) for most of the noise levels. The less satisfactory convergence behavior at σ(t) = 80.0 is due to inadequate training of the diffusion models at this particular noise level, which is minimally sampled during the training of actual diffusion models (see Appendix G.2 for more details). Figure 3: Images sampled from vari- ous Models. The figure shows the sam- ples generated using different models starting from the same initial noises. • Similarity in Score functions. Furthermore, Figure 2(left, gray line) demonstrates that DL and DG maintain small score differences (RMSE less than 0.05) across all noise levels, indicating that these denoisers exhibit similar func- tion mappings throughout the diffusion process. • Similarity in principal components. As shown in Fig- ure 4(right), for a wide noise range (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0]), the leading singular vectors of the linear weights Wσ(t) (denoted ULinear) align well withU, the singular vectors of the Gaussian weights.4 This implies that U, representing the principal components of the training data, is effectively captured by the diffusion models. In the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]), however, Dθ approximates the identity mapping, leading to ambiguous singular vectors with minimal impact on image generation. Further analy- sis of Dθ’s behavior in the low-noise regime is provided in Appendices D and F.1. Since the optimization problem (9) is convex w.r.t. Wσ(t) and bσ(t), the optimal solution DL represents the unique optimal linear approximation of Dθ. Our analyses demonstrate that this optimal linear approximation closely aligns with DG, leading to our central finding: diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias (which we term as the Gaussian inductive bias) towards learning the Gaussian structure of training data. This manifests in two main ways: ( i) In the high-noise variance regime, well-trained diffusion models learn Dθ that closely approximate the linear Gaussian denoisers DG; (ii) As noise variance decreases, although Dθ diverges from DG, DG remains nearly identical to the optimal linear approximation DL, and images generated by DG retain structural similarity to those generated by Dθ. Finally, we emphasize that the Gaussian inductive bias only emerges in the generalization regime. By contrast, in the memorization regime, Figure 5 shows that DL significantly diverges from DG, and 4For σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0], the less well recovered singular vectors have singular values close to 0, whereas those corresponding to high singular values are well recovered. 6Clean Image!Noise\"∼.(/,&'#1)#=!+\" )!(\";&(')) )\"(\";&('))(70000))\"(\";&('))(35000))\"(\";&('))(1094))\"(\";&('))(68) )!(#;&(')) )\"(#;&('))(70000))\"(#;&('))(35000))\"(#;&('))(1094))\"(#;&('))(68) Denoising Outputs  for !\"=4 MemorizationGeneralization(a) (b) Figure 5: Comparison between the diffusion denoisers in memorization and generalization regimes. Figure(a) demonstrates that in the memorization regime (trained on small datasets of size 1094 and 68), DL significantly diverges from DG, and both provide substantially poorer approxima- tions of Dθ compared to the generalization regime (trained on larger datasets of size 35000 and 1094). Figure(b) qualitatively shows that the denoising outputs of Dθ closely match those of DG only in the generalization regime—a similarity that persists even when the denoisers process pure noise inputs. both DG and DL provide considerably poorer approximations of Dθ compared to the generalization regime. 3.3 Theoretical Analysis In this section, we demonstrate that imposing linear constraints on diffusion models while minimizing the denoising score matching objective (3) leads to the emergence of Gaussian structure. Theorem 1. Consider a diffusion denoiser parameterized as a single-layer linear network, defined as D(xt; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)xt + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is a linear weight matrix and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias vector. When the data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ, the optimal solution to the score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser defined in (6): DG(xt; σ(t)) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT (xt − µ) + µ, with Wσ(t) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT and bσ(t) = \u0010 I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT \u0011 µ. The detailed proof is postponed to Appendix E. This optimal solution corresponds to the classical Wiener filter [ 31], revealing that diffusion models naturally learn the Gaussian denoisers when constrained to linear architectures. To understand why highly nonlinear diffusion models operate near this linear regime, it is helpful to model the training data distribution as the multi-delta distribution p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi), where {y1, y2, ...,yN } is the finite training images. Notice that this formulation better reflects practical scenarios where only a finite number of training samples are available rather than the ground truth data distribution. Importantly, it is proved in [ 25] that the optimal denoisers DM in this case is approximately equivalent to DG for high noise variance σ(t) and query points far from the finite training data. This equivalence explains the strong similarity between DG and DM in the high-noise variance regime, and consequently, why Dθ and DG exhibit high similarity in this regime—deep networks converge to the optimal denoisers for finite training datasets. However, this equivalence betweenDG and DM breaks down at lower σ(t) values. The denoising outputs of DM are convex combinations of training data points, weighted by a softmax function with temperature σ(t)2. As σ(t)2 decreases, this softmax function increasingly approximates an argmax function, effectively retrieving the training point yi closest to the input x. Learning this optimal solution requires not only sufficient model capacity to memorize the entire training dataset but also, as shown in [32], an exponentially large number of training samples. Due to these learning challenges, deep networks instead converge to local minimaDθ that, while differing fromDM, exhibit better generalization property. Our experiments reveal that these learned Dθ share similar function mappings with DG. The precise mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question for future research. 7MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 6: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structure when training dataset is large. Models with a fixed scale (channel size 128) are trained across various dataset sizes. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. ”NN” denotes the nearest neighbor in the training dataset to the images generated by the diffusion models. Notably, modeling pdata(x) as a multi-delta distribution reveals a key insight: while unconstrained optimal denoisers (5) perfectly capture the scores of the empirical distribution, they have no gen- eralizability. In contrast, Gaussian denoisers, despite having higher score approximation errors due to the linear constraint, can generate novel images that closely match those produced by the actual diffusion models. This suggests that the generative power of diffusion models stems from the imperfect learning of the score functions of the empirical distribution. 4 Conditions for the Emergence of Gaussian Structures and Generalizability In Section 3, we demonstrate that diffusion models exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers that are close to the Gaussian denoisers. In this section, we investigate the conditions under which this bias manifests. Our findings reveal that this inductive bias is linked to model generalization and is governed by (i) the model capacity relative to the dataset size and (ii) the training duration. For additional results, including experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, see Appendix F. 4.1 Gaussian Structures Emerge when Model Capacity is Relatively Small First, we find that the Gaussian inductive bias and the generalization of diffusion models are heavily influenced by the relative size of the model capacity compared to the training dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of training dataset. This argument is supported by the following two key observations: • Increasing dataset size prompts the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed model scale. We train diffusion models using the EDM configuration [4] with a fixed channel size of 128 on datasets of varying sizes [68, 137, 1094, 8750, 35000, 70000] until FID convergence. Figure 6(left) demonstrates that the score approximation error between diffusion denoisers Dθ and Gaussian denoisers DG decreases as the training dataset size grows, particularly in the crucial intermediate noise variance regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]). This increasing similarity between Dθ and DG correlates with a transition in the models’ behavior: from a memorization regime, where generated images are replicas of training samples, to a generalization regime, where novel images exhibiting Gaussian structure5 are produced, as shown in Figure 6(b). This correlation underscores the critical role of Gaussian structure in the generalization capabilities of diffusion models. • Decreasing model capacity promotes the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed dataset sizes. Next, we investigate the impact of model scale by training diffusion models with varying channel sizes [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], corresponding to[64k, 251k, 992k, 4M, 16M, 64M] parameters, on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. Figure 7(left) shows that in the intermediate noise variance regime 5We use the term ”exhibiting Gaussian structure” to describe images that resemble those generated by Gaussian denoisers. 8GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 7: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure when model scale is small. Models with different scales are trained on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 8: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Diffusion model with same scale (channel size 128) is trained using 1094 images. The left and right figures shows the score difference and the generated images respectively. (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]), the discrepancy between Dθ and DG decreases with decreasing model scale, indicating that Gaussian structure emerges in low-capacity models. Figure 7(right) demonstrates that this trend corresponds to a transition from data memorization to the generation of images exhibiting Gaussian structure. Here we note that smaller models lead to larger discrepancy between Dθ and DG in the high-noise regime. This phenomenon arises because diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances, especially when model capacity is limited (see more details in Appendix F.2). These two experiments collectively suggest that the inductive bias of diffusion models is governed by the relative capacity of the model compared to the training dataset size. 4.2 Overparameterized Models Learn Gaussian Structures before Memorization In the overparameterized regime, where model capacity significantly exceeds training dataset size, diffusion models eventually memorize the training data when trained to convergence. However, examining the learning progression reveals a key insight: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures with generalizability before they memorize. Figure 8(a) demonstrates that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ progressively converge to DG in the intermediate noise variance regime, indicating that the diffusion model is progressively learning the Gaussian structure in the initial stages of training. Notably. By epoch 841, the diffusion model generates images strongly resembling those produced by the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 8(b). However, continued training beyond this point increases the difference between Dθ and DG as the model transitions toward memorization. This observation suggests that early stopping could be an effective strategy for promoting generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. 9Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 35000, model scale 128 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 35000) Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 1094) Non-overlapping datasets with size 1094, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 8 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (1094) Figure 9: Diffusion models in the strong generalization regime generate similar images as the Gaussian models.

Figure(c): Early stopping and reducing model capacity help transition diffusion models from memorization to generalization. 5 Connection between Strong Generalizability and Gaussian Structure A recent study [ 20] reveals an intriguing ”strong generalization” phenomenon: diffusion models trained on large, non-overlapping image datasets generate nearly identical images from the same initial noise. While this phenomenon might be attributed to deep networks’ inductive bias towards learning the ”true” continuous distribution of photographic images, we propose an alternative explanation: rather than learning the complete distribution, deep networks may capture certain low-dimensional common structural features shared across these datasets and these features can be partially explained by the Gaussian structure. To validate this hypothesis, we examine two diffusion models with channel size 128, trained on non-overlapping datasets S1 and S2 (35000 images each). Figure 9(a) shows that images generated by these models (bottom) closely match those from their corresponding Gaussian models (top), highlighting the Gaussian structure’s role in strong generalization. Comparing Figure 9(a)(top) and (b)(top), we observe that DG generates nearly identical images whether the Gaussian structure is calculated on a small dataset (1094 images) or a much larger one (35000 images). This similarity emerges because datasets of the same class can exhibit similar Gaussian structure (empirical covariance) with relatively few samples—just hundreds for FFHQ. Given the Gaussian structure’s critical role in generalization, small datasets may already contain much of the information needed for generalization, contrasting previous assertions in [20] that strong generalization requires training on datasets of substantial size (more than 105 images). However, smaller datasets increase memorization risk, as shown in Figure 9(b). To mitigate this, as discussed in Section 4, we can either reduce model capacity or implement early stopping (Figure 9(c)). Indeed, models trained on 1094 and 35000 images generate remarkably similar images, though the smaller dataset yields lower perceptual quality. This similarity further demonstrates that small datasets contain substantial generalization-relevant information closely tied to Gaussian structure. Further discussion on the connections and differences between our work and [20] are detailed in Appendix H. 6 Discussion In this study, we empirically demonstrate that diffusion models in the generalization regime have the inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close to the corresponding linear Gaussian denoisers. Although real-world image distributions are significantly different from Gaussian, our findings imply that diffusion models have the bias towards learning and utilizing low-dimensional data structures, such as the data covariance, for image generation. However, the underlying mechanism by which the nonlinear diffusion models, trained with gradient descent, exhibit such linearity remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Moreover, the Gaussian structure only partially explains diffusion models’ generalizability. While models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, a substan- tial gap persists between the linear Gaussian denoisers and the actual nonlinear diffusion models, especially in the intermediate noise regime. As a result, images generated by Gaussian denoisers fall 10short in perceptual quality compared to those generated by the actual diffusion models especially for complex dataset such as CIFAR-10.

For a diffusion denoiser, Dθ(x; σ(t)), to be considered approximately linear, it must fulfill the following conditions: • Additivity: The function should satisfy Dθ(x1 + x2; σ(t)) ≈ Dθ(x1; σ(t)) + Dθ(x2; σ(t)). • Homogeneity: It should also adhere to Dθ(αx; σ(t)) ≈ αDθ(x; σ(t)). To jointly assess these properties, we propose to measure the difference betweenDθ(αx1+βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)). While the linearity score is introduced as the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)) in the main text: LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , (11) it can also be defined with the normalized mean square difference (NMSE): Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) − (αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)))||2 ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))||2 , (12) where the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 randomly sampled pairs of (x1, x2). In the next section, we will demonstrate the linearity score with both metrics. Since the diffusion denoisers are trained solely on inputs x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), their behaviors on out- of-distribution inputs can be quite irregular. To produce a denoised output with meaningful image structure, it is critical that the noise component in the input x matches the correct variance σ(t)2. Therefore, our analysis of linearity is restricted to in-distribution inputs x1 and x2, which are randomly sampled images with additive Gaussian noises calibrated to noise variance σ(t)2. We also need to ensure that the values of α and β are chosen such that α2 + β2 = 1, maintaining the correct variance for the noise term in the combined input αx1 + βx2. We present the linearity scores, calculated with varying values of α and β, for diffusion models trained on diverse datasets in Figure 10. These models are trained with the EDM-VE configuration proposed in [4], which ensures the resulting models are in the generalization regime. Typically, setting α = β = 1/ √ 2 yields the lowest linearity score; however, even in this scenario, the cosine similarity remains impressively high, exceeding 0.96. This high value underscores the presence of significant linearity within diffusion denoisers. We would like to emphasize that for linearity to manifest in diffusion denoisers, it is crucial that they are well-trained, achieving a low denoising score matching loss as indicated in (3). As shown in Figure 11, the linearity notably reduces in a less well trained diffusion model (Baseline-VE) comapred to its well-trained counterpart (EDM-VE). Although both models utilize the same ’VE’ network architecture Fθ(x; σ(t)) [2], they differ in how the diffusion denoisers are parameterized: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), (13) 15where cskip is the skip connection and cout modulate the scale of the network output. With carefully tailored cskip and cout, the EDM-VE configuration achieves a lower score matching loss compared to Baseline-VE, resulting in samples with higher quality as illustrated in Figure 11(right). B Emerging Linearity of Diffusion Models In this section we provide a detailed discussion on the observation that diffusion models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, which is briefly described in Section 3.1. B.1 Generalization and Memorization Regimes of Diffusion Models As shown in Figure 12, as the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images. To measure the generalization capabilities of diffusion models, it is crucial to assess their ability to generate images that are not mere replications of the training dataset. This can be quantitatively evaluated by generating a large set of images from the diffusion model and measuring the average difference between these generated images and their nearest neighbors in the training set. Specifically, let {x1, x2, ...,xk} represent k randomly sampled images from the diffusion models (we choose k = 100 in our experiments), and let Y := {y1, y2, ...,yN } denote the training dataset consisting of N images. We define the generalization score as follows: GL Score := 1 k kX i=1 ||xi − NNY (xi)||2 ||xi||2 (14) where NNY (xi) represents the nearest neighbor of the samplexk in the training datasetY , determined by the Euclidean distance on a per-pixel basis. Empirically, a GL score exceeding 0.6 indicates that the diffusion models are effectively generalizing beyond the training dataset. B.2 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime As demonstrated in Figure 13(a) and (d), diffusion models transition from the memorization regime to the generalization regime as the training dataset size increases. Concurrently, as depicted in Fig- ure 13(b), (c), (e) and (f), the corresponding diffusion denoisers exhibit increasingly linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets datasets including FFHQ [26], AFHQ [28] and LSUN- Churches [29], as well as various model architectures including EDM-VE [ 3], EDM-VP [2] and EDM-ADM [34]. This emerging linearity implies that the hidden linear structure plays an important role in the generalizability of diffusion model. C Linear Distillation As discussed in Section 3.1, we propose to study the hidden linearity observed in diffusion denosiers with linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)), we aim to approxi- Figure 10: Linearity scores for varying α and β. The diffusion models are trained with the edm-ve configuration [4], which ensures the models are in the generalization regime. 16Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models ((*!;,(-)) Figure 11: Linearity scores and sampling trajectory.

Notice that for three dimensional images with size (c, h, w), x ∈ Rd represents their vectorized version, where d = c × w × h.

Addi- tionally, we employ the Adam optimizer [35] for updates. Additional linear distillation results are provided in Figure 14. 17FFHQ CIFAR-10(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 13: Diffusion model exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization. Figure(a) and (d) demonstrate that for both FFHQ and CIFAR-10 datasets, the generalization score increases with the training dataset size, indicating progressive model generaliza- tion. Figure(b), (c), (e), and (f) show that this transition towards generalization is accompanied by increasing denoiser linearity. Specifically, Figure(b) and (e) display linearity scores calculated using cosine similarity (11), while Figure(c) and (f) show scores computed using NMSE (12). Both metrics reveal consistent trends. D Diffusion Models in Low-noise Regime are Approximately Linear Mapping It should be noted that the low score difference between DG and Dθ within the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]) does not imply the diffusion denoisers capture the Gaussian structure, instead, the similarity arises since both of them are converging to the identity mapping as σ(t) decreases. As shown in Figure 15, within this regime, the differences between the noisy input x and their corresponding denoised outputs Dθ(x; σ(t)) quickly approach 0. This indicates that the learned denoisers Dθ progressively converge to the identity function. Additionally, from (6), it is evident that the difference between the Gaussian weights and the identity matrix diminishes as σ(t) decreases, which explains why DG can well approximate Dθ in the low noise variance regime. We hypothesize that Dθ learns the identity function because of the following two reasons: (i) within the low-noise regime, since the added noise is negligible compared to the clean image, the identity function already achieves a small denoising error, thus serving as a shortcut which is exploited by the deep network. (ii) As discussed in Appendix A, diffusion models are typically parameterized as follows: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), where Fθ represents the deep network, and cskip(σ(t)) and cout(σ(t)) are adaptive parameters for the skip connection and output scaling, respectively, which adjust according to the noise variance levels. For canonical works on diffusion models [2–4, 34], as σ(t) approaches zero, cskip and cout converge to 1 and 0 respectively. Consequently, at low variance levels, the function forms of diffusion denoisers are approximatly identity mapping: Dθ(x; σ(t)) ≈ x. This convergence to identity mapping has several implications. First, the weights Wσ(t) of the distilled linear models DL approach the identity matrix at low variances, leading to ambiguous 18Algorithm 1 Linear Distillation Require: (i) the targeted diffusion denoiser Dθ(·; σ(t)), (ii) weights Wσ(t) and biases bσ(t), both initialized to zero, (iii) gradient step size η, (iv) number of training iterations K, (v) training batch size n, (vi) image dataset S. for k = 1 to K do Randomly sample a batch of training images {x1, x2, . . . ,xn} from S.

Figure(a) demonstrates the gradual symmetrization of linear weights during the distillation process. Figure(b) shows that at convergence, the singular values of the linear weights closely match those of the Gaussian weights. Figure(c) and Figure(d) display the leading singular vectors of both linear and Gaussian weights at σ(t) = 4 for FFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets, respectively, revealing a strong correlation. singular vectors. This explains the poor recovery of singular vectors for σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116] shown in Figure 4. Second, the presence of the bias term in (8) makes it challenging for our linear model to learn the identity function, resulting in large errors at σ(t) = 0.002 as shown in Figure 4(a). Finally, from (4), we observe that when Dθ acts as an identity mapping, xi+1 remains unchanged from xi. This implies that sampling steps in low-variance regions minimally affect the generated image content, as confirmed in Figure 2, where image content shows negligible variation during these steps. 19Normalized MSE between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙  Cosine Similarity between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙   (b)(a)  (c) (d) Figure 15: Difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x for various noise variance levels. Figures(a) and (c) show the differences between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x across σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 80], measured by normalized MSE and cosine similarity, respectively. Figures(b) and (d) provide zoomed-in views of (a) and (c). The diffusion models were trained on the FFHQ dataset. Notice that the difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x quickly converges to near zero in the low noise variance regime. The trend is consistent for various model architectures. E Theoretical Analysis E.1 Proof of Theorem 1 In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1 (Section 3.3). Our theorem is based on the following two assumptions: Assumption 1. Suppose that the diffusion denoisers are parameterized as single-layer linear net- works, defined as D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is the linear weight and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias. Assumption 2. The data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ Theorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser: DG(x, σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), where Σ = UΛUT represents the SVD of the covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,d} and ˜Λσ(t) = diag[ λk λk+σ(t)2 ]. Furthermore, this optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. To proveTheorem 1, we first show that the Gaussian denoiser is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the linear network constraint. Then we will show that such optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. The Global Optimal Solution. Under the constraint that the diffusion denoiser is restricted to a single-layer linear network with bias: D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), (15) We get the following optimizaiton problem from Equation (3): W⋆, b⋆ = arg min W,b L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2, (16) where we omit the footnote σ(t) in Wσ(t) and bσ(t) for simplicity. Since expectation preserves convexity, the optimization problem Equation (16) is a convex optimization problem. To find the global optimum, we first eliminate b by requiring the partial derivative ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) to be 0. Since ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)((W − I)x + Wϵ + b) (17) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata ((W − I)x + b) (18) = 2 ∗ ((W − I)µ + b), (19) we have b⋆ = (I − W∗)µ. (20) 20Utilizing the expression for b, we get the following equivalent form of the optimization problem: W⋆ = arg min W L(W; σ(t)) := 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x − µ + ϵ) − (x − µ)||2 2. (21) The derivative ∇W L(W; σ(t)) is: ∇W L(W; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ ExEϵ(W(x − µ + ϵ)(x − µ + ϵ)T − (x − µ)(x − µ + ϵ)T ) (22) = 2 ∗ Ex((W − I)(x − µ)(x − µ)T + σ(t)2W) (23) = 2 ∗ W(Σ + σ(t)2I) − 2 ∗ Σ. (24) Suppose Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,n}, by setting ∇W L(W; σ(t)) to 0, we get the optimal solution: W⋆ = UΛUT U(Λ + σ(t)2I)−1UT (25) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT , (26) where ˜Λσ(t)[i, i] = λi λi+σ(t)2 and λi = Λ[i, i]. Substitute W⋆ back to Equation (20), we have: b⋆ = (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (27) Notice that the expression for W⋆ and b⋆ is exactly the Gaussian denoiser. Next, we will show this optimal solution can be achieved with gradient descent. Gradient Descent Recovers the Optimal Solution. Consider minimizing the population loss: L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2. (28) Define ˜W := [W b ], ˜x := \u0014 x 1 \u0015 and ˜ϵ = \u0014 ϵ 0 \u0015 , then we can rewrite Equation (28) as: L( ˜W; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)|| ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ) − x||2 2. (29) We can compute the gradient in terms of ˜W as: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ)(˜x + ˜ϵ)T − x(˜x + ˜ϵ)T ) (30) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x˜xT + ˜x˜ϵT + ˜ϵ˜xT + ˜ϵ˜ϵT ) − x˜xT − x˜ϵT ). (31) Since Eϵ(˜ϵ) = 0 and Eϵ(˜ϵ˜ϵT ) = \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex( ˜W(˜x˜xT + \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 ) − x˜xT ). (32) Since E(˜x˜xT ) = \u0014 E(xxT ) E(x) E(xT ) 1 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ˜W \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 − 2 \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 . (33) With learning rate η, we can write the update rule as: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 ) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 (34) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2ηA) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 , (35) where we define A := I − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 for simplicity. By recursively expanding the expression for ˜W, we have: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(0)At+1 + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 tX i=0 Ai. (36) 21Notice that there exists a η, such that every eigen value of A is smaller than 1 and greater than 0. In this case, At+1 → 0 as t → ∞. Similarly, by the property of matrix geometric series, we havePt i=0 Ai → (I − A)−1. Therefore we have: ˜W → \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ uT 1 \u0015−1 (37) = \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 , (38) where we define B := Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I for simplicity. By the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula, we have: \u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 = \u0014 (B − µµT )−1 −(B − µµT )−1µ −(1 − µT B−1µ)−1µT B−1 (1 − µT B−1µ)−1 \u0015 . (39) Therefore, we have: ˜W → h Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1−µT B−1µ −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1−µT B−1µ i , (40) from which we have W → Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ (41) b → −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1 − µT B−1µ (42) Since Ex[xxT ] = Ex[(x − µ)((x − µ)T ] + µµT , we have: W = Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 + µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ. (43) Applying Sherman-Morrison Formula, we have: (B − µµT )−1 = B−1 + B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ , (44) therefore µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ = µµT B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ − µµT B−1µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ (45) = µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ(µµT B−1 − µµT B−1) (46) = 0 (47) , which implies W → Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 (48) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT . (49) Similarly, we have: b → (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (50) Therefore, gradient descent with a properly chosen learning rate η recovers the Gaussian Denoisers when time goes to infinity. E.2 Two Extreme Cases Our empirical results indicate that the best linear approximation of Dθ is approximately equivalent to DG. According to the orthogonality principle [36], this requires Dθ to satisfy: Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I){(Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − (x − µ))(x + ϵ − µ)T } ≈0. (51) Notice that (51) does not hold for general denoisers. Two extreme cases for this to hold are: 22• Case 1: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ x for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). • Case 2: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ DG(x + ϵ; σ(t)) for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). Case 1 requires Dθ(x+ϵ; σ(t)) to be the oracle denoiser that perfectly recover the ground truth clean image, which never happens in practice except when σ(t) becomes extremely small. Instead, our empirical results suggest diffusion models in the generalization regime bias towards Case 2, where deep networks learn Dθ that approximate (not equal) to DG. This is evidenced in Figure 5(b), where diffusion models trained on larger datasets (35000 and 7000 images) produce denoising outputs similar to DG. Notice that this similarity holds even when the denoisers take pure Gaussian noise as input. The exact mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question and we leave it as future work. F More Discussion on Section 4 While in Section 4 we mainly focus on the discussion of the behavior of diffusion denoisers in the intermediate-noise regime, in this section we study the denoiser dynamics in both low and high-noise regime. We also provide additional experiment results on CIFAR-10 dataset. F.1 Behaviors in Low-noise Regime We visualize the score differences between DG and Dθ in low-noise regime in Figure 16. The left figure demonstrates that when the dataset size becomes smaller than a certain threshold, the score difference at σ = 0 remains persistently non-zero. Moreover, the right figure shows that this difference depends solely on dataset size rather than model capacity. This phenomenon arises from two key factors: (i) Dθ converges to the identity mapping at low noise levels, independent of training dataset size and model capacity, and (ii) DG approximates the identity mapping at low noise levels only when the empirical covariance matrix is full-rank, as can be seen from (6). Since the rank of the covariance matrix is upper-bounded by the training dataset size, DG differs from the identity mapping when the dataset size is smaller than the data dimension. This creates a persistent gap between DG and Dθ, with smaller datasets leading to lower rank and consequently larger score differences. These observations align with our discussion in Appendix D. F.2 Behaviors in High-noise Regime As shown in Figure 7(a), while a decreased model scale pushes Dθ in the intermediate noise region towards DG, their differences enlarges in the high noise variance regime. This phenomenon arises be- cause diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances. A shown in Figure 17, for high σ(t), Dθ converge to DG when trained with sufficient model capacity (Figure 17(b)) and training time (Figure 17(c)). This behavior is consistent irrespective of the training dataset sizes (Figure 17(a)). Convergence in the high-noise variance regime is less crucial in practice, since diffusion steps in Figure 16: Score differences for low-noise variances. The left and right figures are the zoomed-in views of Figure 6(a) and Figure 7(a) respectively. Notice that when the dataset size is smaller than the dimension of the image, the score differences are always non-zero at σ = 0. 23Denoising Outputs  for 𝜎𝑡=60 (PSNR = -29.5 dB)Effect of Model Scale (1094 training images) Effect of Training Epochs (1094 training images) Effect of Dataset Size𝒚=𝒙+𝜎𝑡∗𝝐 𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(4)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(8)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(128) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(187)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(841)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(9173)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64210) (a) (b) (c) Figure 17: Dθ converge to DG with no overfitting for high noise variances.

All models are trained on a fixed dataset of 1,094 images. this regime contribute substantially less than those in the intermediate-noise variance regime—a phenomenon we analyze further in Appendix G.5. F.3 Similarity between Diffusion Denoiers and Gaussian Denoisers In Section 4, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent in models with limited capacity and during early training stages, a finding qualitatively validated in Figure 18. Specifically, Figure 18(b) shows that larger models (channel sizes 128 and 64) tend to memorize, 24MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 19: Large dataset size prompts the Gaussian structure. Models with the same scale (channel size 64) are trained on CIFAR-10 datasets with varying sizes.

GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 20: Smaller model scale prompts the Gaussian structure. Models with varying scales are trained on a fixed CIFAR-10 datasets with 782 images. Figure(a) shows that smaller model scale leads to increased similarity between DG and Dθ in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, smaller scale leads to larger score differences in high-noise regime due to insufficient training from limited model capacity. directly retrieving training data as denoising outputs. In contrast, smaller models (channel sizes 8 and 4) exhibit behavior similar to DG, producing comparable denoising outputs. Similarly, Figure 18(c) reveals that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ outputs progressively align with those of DG. However, extended training beyond this point leads to memorization. F.4 CIFAR-10 Results The effects of model capacity and training duration on the Gaussian inductive bias, as demonstrated in Figures 19 to 21, extend to the CIFAR-10 dataset. These results confirm our findings from Section 4: the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent when model scale and training duration are limited. G Additional Experiment Results While in the main text we mainly demonstrate our findings using EDM-VE diffusion models trained on FFHQ, in this section we show our results are robust and extend to various model architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models, but it is a fundamental property of denoising autoencoders [37]. Lastly, we verify that our 25GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 21: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Models with the same scale (channel size 128) are trained on a fixed CIFAR-10 datasets with 782 images. Figure(a) shows that the similarity between DG and Dθ progressively increases during early training epochs (0-921) in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, continue training beyond this point results in divergedDG and Dθ, resulting in memorization.

Figures(a), (b) and (c) correspond to diffusion models trained on FFHQ, with EDM-VE, EDM-ADM and EDM-VP network architectures specified in [4] respectively. conclusions remain consistent when using alternative metrics such as NMSE instead of the RMSE used in the main text. G.1 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various Network Architectures We first demonstrate that diffusion models capture the Gaussian structure of the training dataset, irrespective of the deep network architectures used. As shown in Figure 22 (a), (b), and (c), although the actual diffusion models, Dθ, are parameterized with different architectures, for all noise variances except σ(t) ∈ {0.002, 80.0}, their corresponding linear models, DL, consistently converge towards the common Gaussian models, DG, determined by the training dataset. Qualitatively, as depicted in Figure 23, despite variations in network architectures, diffusion models generate nearly identical images, matching those generated from the Gaussian models. G.2 Gaussian Inductive Bias as a General Property of DAEs In previous sections, we explored the properties of diffusion models by interpreting them as collections of deep denoisers, which are equivalent to the denoising autoencoders (DAEs) [37] trained on various noise variances by minimizing the denoising score matching objective(3). Although diffusion models and DAEs are equivalent in the sense that both of them are trying to learn the score function of the 26Figure 23: Images sampled from various model. The figure shows the sampled images from diffusion models with different network architectures and those from their corresponding Gaussian models. noise-mollified data distribution [38], the training objective of diffusion models is more complex [4]: min θ Ex,ϵ,σ[λ(σ)cout(σ)2||Fθ(x + ϵ, σ) − 1 cout(σ)(x − cskip(σ)(x + ϵ)) | {z } linear combination of x and ϵ ||2 2], (52) where x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I) and σ ∼ ptrain. Notice that the training objective of diffusion models has a few distinct characteristics: • Diffusion models use a single deep network Fθ to perform denoising score matching across all noise variances while DAEs are typically trained separately for each noise level. • Diffusion models are not trained uniformly across all noise variances. Instead, during training the probability of sampling a given noise level σ is controlled by a predefined distribution ptrain and the loss is weighted by λ(σ). • Diffusion models often utilize special parameterizations (13). Therefore, the deep network Fθ is trained to predict a linear combination of the clean image x and the noise ϵ, whereas DAEs typically predict the clean image directly. Given these differences, we investigate whether the Gaussian inductive bias is unique to diffusion models or a general characteristic of DAEs. To this end, we train separate DAEs (deep denoisers) using the vanilla denoising score matching objective (3) on each of the 10 discrete noise variances specified by the EDM schedule [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002], and compare the score differences between them and the corresponding Gaussian denoisers DG. We use no special parameterization so that Dθ = Fθ; that is, the deep network directly predicts the clean image. Furthermore, the DAEs for each noise variance are trained till convergence, ensuring all noise levels are trained sufficiently. We consider the following architectural choices: • DAE-NCSN: In this setting, the network Fθ uses the NCSN architecture [3], the same as that used in the EDM-VE diffusion model. • DAE-Skip: In this setting, Fθ is a U-Net [ 39] consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization [40], leaky ReLU activation [41] and convolutional skip connections. We refer to this network as ”Skip-Net”. Compared to NCSN, which adapts the state of the art architecture designs, Skip-Net is deliberately constructed to be as simple as possible to test how architectural complexity affects the Gaussian inductive bias. • DAE-DiT: In this setting, Fθ is a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) introduced in [42]. Vision Transformers are known to lack inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance that are inherent to convolutional models [43]. Here we are interested in if this affects the Gaussian inductive bias. 27Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) (a) (b) Figure 24: Comparison between DAEs and diffusion models. Figure(a) compares the score field approximation error between Gaussian models and both (i) diffusion models (EDM vs. Gaussian) and (ii) DAEs with varying architectures. Figure(b) illustrates the generation trajectories of different models initialized from the same noise input. • DAE-Linear: In this setting we set Fθ to be a linear model with a bias term as in (8). According to Theorem 1, these models should converge to Gaussian denoisers. The quantitative results are shown in Figure 24(a). First, the DAE-linear models well approximateDG across all 10 discrete steps (RMSE smaller than 0.04), consistent with Theorem 1. Second, despite the differences between diffusion models (EDM) and DAEs, they achieve similar score approximation errors relative to DG for most noise variances, meaning that they can be similarly approximated by DG. However, diffusion models exhibit significantly larger deviations fromDG at higher noise variances (σ ∈ {42.415, 80.0}) since they utilize a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution ptrain that emphasizes training on intermediate noise levels, leading to under-training at high noise variances. Lastly, the DAEs with different architectures achieve comparable score approximation errors, and both DAEs and diffusion models generate images matching those from the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 24(b). These findings demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models or specific architectures but is a fundamental property of DAEs. G.3 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various datasets As illustrated in Figure 25, for diffusion models trained on the CIFAR-10, AFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets that are in the generalization regime, their generated samples match those produced by the corresponding Gaussian models. Additionally, their linear approximations, DL, obtained through linear distillation, align closely with the Gaussian models, DG, resulting in nearly identical generated images. These findings confirm that the Gaussian structure is prevalent across various datasets. G.4 Strong Generalization on CIFAR-10 Figure 26 demonstrates the strong generalization effect on CIFAR-10. Similar to the observations in Section 5, reducing model capacity or early stopping the training process prompts the Gaussian inductive bias, leading to generalization. G.5 Measuring Score Approximation Error with NMSE While in Section 3.1 we define the score field approximation error between denoisers D1 and D2 with RMSE ( (10)), this error can also be quantified using NMSE: Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) ||D1(x + ϵ) − D2(x + ϵ)||2 ||D1(x + ϵ)||2 . (53) As shown in Figure 27, while the trend in intermediate-noise and low-noise regimes remains unchanged, NMSE amplifies differences in the high-noise variance regime compared to RMSE. This amplified score difference between DG and Dθ does not contradict our main finding that diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers 28Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated Samples Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated SamplesLSUN-Churches AFHQ(a) (b) (c) (d) Final Generated SamplesCIFAR- 10Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) image 1image 2image 3image 4image 5 (e) (f) Figure 25: Final generated images and sampling trajectories for various models.

Figures(b), (d) and (f) demonstrate the corresponding sampling trajectories. approximately equivalent to DG in the high-noise variance regime. As discussed in Section 3.2 and appendices F.2 and G.2, this large score difference stems from inadequate training in this regime. Figure 27 (Gaussian vs. DAE) demonstrates that when DAEs are sufficiently trained at specific noise variances, they still converge to DG. Importantly, the insufficient training in the high-noise variance regime minimally affects final generation quality. Figure 25(f) shows that while the diffusion model (EDM) produces noisy trajectories at early timesteps ( σ ∈ {80.0, 42.415}), these artifacts quickly disappear in later stages, indicating that the Gaussian inductive bias is most influential in the intermediate-noise variance regime. Notably, even when Dθ are inadequately trained in the high-noise variance regime, they remain approximable by linear functions, though these functions no longer match DG. 29Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 25000, model scale 64 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 25000)Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 782) Non-overlapping datasets with size 782, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 4 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (782) Figure 26: Strong generalization on CIFAR-10 dataset.

H Discussion on Geometry-Adaptive Harmonic Bases H.1 GAHB only Partially Explain the Strong Generalization Recent work [20] observes that diffusion models trained on sufficiently large non-overlapping datasets (of the same class) generate nearly identical images. They explain this ”strong generalization” phenomenon by analyzing bias-free deep diffusion denoisers with piecewise linear input-output 30mappings: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))x (54) = X k λk(xt)uk(xt)vT k (xt)xt, (55) where λk(xt), uk(xt), and vk(xt) represent the input-dependent singular values, left and right singular vectors of the network Jacobian ∇D(xt; σ(t)). Under this framework, strong generalization occurs when two denoisers D1 and D2 have similar Jacobians: ∇D1(xt; σ(t)) ≈ ∇D2(xt; σ(t)). The authors conjecture this similarity arises from networks’ inductive bias towards learning certain optimal ∇D(xt; σ(t)) that has sparse singular values and the singular vectors of which are the geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHB)—near-optimal denoising bases that adapt to input xt. While [20] provides valuable insights, their bias-free assumption does not reflect real-world diffusion models, which inherently contain bias terms. For feed forward ReLU networks, the denoisers are piecewise affine: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))xt + bxt, (56) where bxt is the network bias that depends on both network parameterization and the noisy input xt [44]. Here, similar Jacobians alone cannot explain strong generalization, as networks may differ significantly in bxt. For more complex network architectures where even piecewise affinity fails, we consider the local linear expansion of D(xt; σ(t)): D(xt + ∆x; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))∆xt + D(xt; σ(t)), (57) which approximately holds for small perturbation ∆x. Thus, although ∇D(xt; σ(t)) characterizes D(xt; σ(t))’s local behavior around xt, it does not provide sufficient information on the global properties. Our work instead examines global behavior, demonstrating that D(xt; σ(t)) is close to DG(xt; σ(t))—the optimal linear denoiser under the Gaussian data assumption. This implies that strong generalization partially stems from networks learning similar Gaussian structures across non-overlapping datasets of the same class. Since our linear model captures global properties but not local characteristics, it complements the local analysis in [20]. H.2 GAHB Emerge only in Intermediate-Noise Regime For completeness, we study the evolution of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across various noise levels σ(t). The results are presented in Figures 28 and 29, which reveal three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [10,80]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors6 of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) well align with those of the Gaussian weights (the leading principal components of the training dataset), consistent with our finding that diffusion denoisers approximate linear Gaussian denoisers in this regime. Notice that DAEs trained sufficiently on separate noise levels (Figure 29) show stronger alignment compared to vanilla diffusion models (Figure 28), which suffer from insufficient training at high noise levels. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,10]: In this regime, GAHB emerge as singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) diverge from the principal components, becoming increasingly adaptive to the geometry of input image. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) show no clear patterns, consistent with our observation that diffusion denoisers approach the identical mapping, which has unconstrained singular vectors. Notice that the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) are the input directions that lead to the maximum variation in denoised outputs, thus revealing meaningful information on the local properties of D(xt; σ(t)) at xt. As demonstrated in Figure 30, perturbing input xt along these vectors at difference noise regimes leads to distinct effects on the final generated images: (i) in the high-noise regime where the leading singular vectors align with the principal components of the training dataset, 6We only care about leading singular vectors since the Jacobians in this regime are highly low-rank. The less well aligned singular vectors have singular values near 0. 31Generation Trajectories                     &(\"#;$(%)) (a) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  )%)(\"#) (b) )( )) )* (c) *+(\",)across Various $(%)   (d) (e) (f) *&(\",)across Various $(%)   *-(\",)across Various $(%)   Figure 28: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels.

(2022) have presented a new type of diffusion process for generative modeling based on heat dissipation, or blurring, as an alternative to isotropic Gaussian diffusion. Here, we show that blurring can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise.

Finally, we propose a generalized class of diffusion models that offers the best of both standard Gaussian denoising diffusion and inverse heat dissipation, which we call Blurring Diffusion Models. 1 I NTRODUCTION Diffusion models are becoming increasingly successful for image generation, audio synthesis and video generation. Diffusion models define a (stochastic) process that destroys a signal such as an image. In general, this process adds Gaussian noise to each dimension independently. However, data such as images clearly exhibit multi-scale properties which such a diffusion process ignores. Recently, the community is looking at new destruction processes which are referred to as determin- istic or ‘cold’ diffusion (Rissanen et al., 2022; Bansal et al., 2022). In these works, the diffusion process is either deterministic or close to deterministic. For example, in (Rissanen et al., 2022) a diffusion model that incorporates heat dissipation is proposed, which can be seen as a form of blur- ring. Blurring is a natural destruction for images, because it retains low frequencies over higher frequencies. However, there still exists a considerable gap between the visual quality of standard denoising dif- fusion models and these new deterministic diffusion models. This difference cannot be explained away by a limited computational budget: A standard diffusion model can be trained with relative little compute (about one to four GPUs) with high visual quality on a task such as unconditional CIFAR10 generation1. In contrast, the visual quality of deterministic diffusion models have been 1An example of a denoising diffusion implementation https://github.com/w86763777/pytorch-ddpm (a) Diffusion (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) (b) Heat Dissipation (Rissanen et al., 2022) (c) Blurring Diffusion Figure 1: Comparison between standard diffusion, heat dissipation and blurring diffusion. 1 arXiv:2209.05557v3  [cs.LG]  1 May 2024Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 much worse so far. In addition, fundamental questions remain around the justification of determin- istic diffusion models: Does their specification offer any guarantees about being able to model the data distribution? In this work, we aim to resolve the gap in quality between models using blurring and additive noise. We present Blurring Diffusion Models, which combine blurring (or heat dissipation) and additive Gaussian noise. We show that the given process can have Markov transitions and that the denoising process can be written with diagonal covariance in frequency space. As a result, we can use modern techniques from denoising diffusion. Our model generates samples with higher visual quality, which is evidenced by better FID scores. 2 B ACKGROUND 2.1 D IFFUSION MODELS Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) learn to gen- erate data by denoising a pre-defined destruction process which is named the diffusion process. Commonly, the diffusion process starts with a datapoint and gradually adds Gaussian noise to the datapoint. Before defining the generative process, this diffusion process needs to be defined. Fol- lowing the definition of (Kingma et al., 2021) the diffusion process can be written as: q(zt|x) = N(zt|αtx, σ2 t I), (1) where x represents the data and zt are the noisy latent variables. Since αt is monotonically decreas- ing and σt is monotonically increasing, the information from x in zt will be gradually destroyed as t increases. Assuming that the above process defined by Equation 1 is Markov, it has transition distributions for zt given zs where 0 ≤ s < t: q(zt|zs) = N(zt|αt|szs, σ2 t|sI), (2) where αt|s = αt/αs and σ2 t|s = σ2 t − α2 t|sσ2 s. A convenient property is that the grid of timesteps can be defined arbitrarily and does not depend on the specific spacing of s and t. We let T = 1 denote the last diffusion step where q(zT |x) ≈ N(zT |0, I), a standard normal distribution. Unless otherwise specified, a time step lies in the unit interval [0, 1]. The Denoising Process Another important distribution is the true denoising distribution q(zs|zt, x) given a datapoint x. Using that q(zs|zt, x) ∝ q(zt|zs)q(zs|x) one can derive that: q(zs|zt, x) = N(zs|µt→s, σ2 t→sI), (3) where σ2 t→s =   1 σ2s + α2 t|s σ2 t|s !−1 and µt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s zt + αs σ2s x ! (4) To generate data, the true denoising process is approximated by a learned denoising process p(zs|zt), where the datapoint x is replaced by a prediction from a learned model. The model distribution is then given by p(zs|zt) = q(zs|zt, ˆx(zt)), (5) where ˆx(zt) is a prediction provided by a neural network. As shown by Song et al. (2020), the true q(zs|zt) → q(zs|zt, x = E[x|zt]) as s → t, which justifies this choice of model: If the generative model takes sufficiently small steps, and if ˆx(zt) is sufficiently expressive, the model can learn the data distribution exactly. Instead of directly predictingx, diffusion models can also modelˆϵt = fθ(zt, t), where fθ is a neural net, so that: ˆx = zt/αt − σt/αtˆϵt, (6) which is inspired by the reparametrization to sample from Equation 1 which is zt = αtx + σtϵt. This parametrization is called the epsilon parametrization and empirically leads to better sample quality than predicting x directly (Ho et al., 2020). 2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Optimization As shown in (Kingma et al., 2021), a continuous-time variational lower bound on the model log likelihood log p(x) is given by the following expectation over squared reconstruction errors: L = Et∼U(0,1)Eϵt∼N(0,I)[w(t)||fθ(zt, t) − ϵt||2], (7) where zt = αtxt+σtϵt. When these terms are weighted appropriately with a particular weightw(t), this objective corresponds to a variational lowerbound on the model likelihood log p(x). However, empirically a constant weighting w(t) = 1 has been found to be superior for sample quality. 2.2 I NVERSE HEAT DISSIPATION Instead of adding increasing amounts of Gaussian noise, Inverse Heat Dissipation Models (IHDMs) use heat dissipation to destroy information (Rissanen et al., 2022). They observe that the Laplace partial differential equation for heat dissipation ∂ ∂t z(i, j, t) = ∆z(i, j, t) (8) can be solved by a diagonal matrix in the frequency domain of the cosine transform if the signal is discretized to a grid. Letting zt denote the solution to the Laplace equation at time-step t, this can be efficiently computed by: zt = Atz0 = VDtVTz0 (9) where VT denotes a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and V denotes the Inverse DCT and z0, zt should be considered vectorized over spatial dimensions to allow for matrix multiplication. The diagonal matrix Dt is the exponent of a weighting matrix for frequenciesΛ and the dissipation time t so that Dt = exp( −Λt). For the specific definition of Λ see Appendix A. In (Rissanen et al., 2022) marginal distribution of the diffusion process is defined as: q(zt|x) = N(zt|Atx, σ2I). (10) The intermediate diffusion state zt is thus constructed by adding a fixed amount of noise to an increasingly blurred data point, rather than adding an increasing amount of noise as in the DDPMs described in Section 2.1. The generative process in (Rissanen et al., 2022) approximately inverts the heat dissipation process with a learned generative model: p(zt−1|zt) = N(zt−1|fθ(zt), δ2I), (11) where the mean forzt−1 is directly learned with a neural networkfθ and has fixed scalar varianceδ2. Similar to DDPMs, the IHDM model is learned by sampling from the forward processzt ∼ q(zt|x) for a random timestep t, and then minimizing the squared reconstruction error between the model fθ(zt) and a ground truth target, which in this case is given by E(zt−1|x) = At−1x, yielding the training loss L = Et∼U(1,...,T)Ezt∼q(zt|x) \u0002 ||At−1x − fθ(zt, t)||2\u0003 . Arbitrary Dissipation Schedule There is no reason why the conceptual time-steps of the model should match perfectly with the dissipation time. Therefore, in (Rissanen et al., 2022) Dt = exp(−Λτt) is redefined where τt monotonically increases with t. The variable τt has a very similar function as αt and σt in noise diffusion: it allows for arbitrary dissipation schedules with respect to the conceptual time-steps t of the model. To avoid confusion, note that in (Rissanen et al., 2022) k is used as the conceptual time for the diffusion process, tk is the dissipation time and uk denotes the latent variables. In this paper, t is the conceptual time and zt denotes the latent variables in pixel space. Then τt is used to denote dissipation time. Open Questions Certain questions remain: (1) Can the heat dissipation process be Markov and if so what is q(zt|zs)? (2) Is the true inverse heating process also isotropic, as the generative process in Equation 11? (3) Finally, are there alternatives to predicting the mean of the previous time-step? In the following section it will turn out that: (1) Yes, the process can be Markov. As a result, de- noising equations similar to the ones for standard diffusion can be derived. (2) No, the generative process is not isotropic, although it is diagonal in the frequency domain. As a consequence, the 3Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 correct amount of noise (per-dimension) can be derived analytically instead of choosing it heuristi- cally. This also guarantees that the model p(zs|zt) can actually express the true q(zs|zt) as s → t, because it is known to tend towards q(zs|zt, x = E[x|zt]) (Song et al., 2020). (3) Yes, processes like heat dissipation can be parametrized similar to the epsilon parametrization in standard diffusion models. 3 H EAT DISSIPATION AS GAUSSIAN DIFFUSION Here we reinterpret the heat dissipation process as a form of Gaussian diffusion similar to that used in (Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019) and others. Throughout this paper, multiplication and division between two vectors is defined to be elementwise. We start with the definition of the marginal distribution from (Rissanen et al., 2022): q(zt|x) = N(zt|Atx, σ2I) (12) where At = VDtVT denotes the blurring or dissipation operation as defined in the previous sec- tion. Throughout this section we let VT denote the orthogonal DCT, which is a specific normal- ization setting of the DCT. Under the change of variables ut = VTzt we can write the diffusion process in frequency space for ut: q(ut|ux) = N(ut|dt · ux, σ2I) (13) where ux = VTx is the frequency response ofx, dt is the diagonal of Dt and vector multiplication is done elementwise. Whereas we defined Dt = exp(−Λτt) we let λ denote the diagonal of Λ so that dt = exp(−λτt). Essentially, dt multiplies higher frequencies with smaller values. Equation 13 shows that the marginal distribution of the frequencies ut is fully factorized over its scalar elements u(i) t for each dimension i. Similarly, the inverse heat dissipation modelpθ(us|ut) is also fully factorized. We can thus equivalently describe the heat dissipation process (and its inverse) in scalar form for each dimension i: q(u(i) t |u(i) 0 ) = N(u(i) t |d(i) t u(i) 0 , σ2) ⇔ u(i) t = d(i) t u(i) 0 + σϵt, with ϵt ∼ N(0, 1). (14) This equation can be recognized as a special case of the standard Gaussian diffusion process introduced in Section 2.1. Let st denote a standard diffusion process in frequency space, so s(i) t = αtu(i) 0 + σtϵt. We can see that Rissanen et al. (2022) have chosen αt = d(i) t and σ2 t = σ2. As shown by Kingma et al. (2021), from a probabilistic perspective only the ratio αt/σt matters here, not the particular choice of the individual αt, σt. This is true because all values can simply be re-scaled without changing the distributions in a meaningful way. This means that, rather than performing blurring and adding fixed noise, the heat dissipation process can be equivalently defined as a relatively standard Gaussian diffusion process, albeit in frequency space. The non-standard aspect here is that the diffusion process in (Rissanen et al., 2022) is defined in the frequency space u, and that it uses a separate noise schedule αt, σt for each of the scalar elements of u: i.e. the noise in this process is non-isotropic. That the marginal variance σ2 is shared between all scalars u(i) under their specification does not reduce its generality: the ratio αt/σ can be freely determined per dimension, and this is all that matters. Markov transition distributions An open question in the formulation of heat dissipation models by Rissanen et al. (2022) was whether or not there exists a Markov processq(ut|us) that corresponds to their chosen marginal distribution q(zt|x). Through its equivalence to Gaussian diffusion shown above, we can now answer this question affirmatively. Using the results summarized in Section 2.1, we have that this process is given by q(ut|us) = N(u|αt|sus, σ2 t|s) (15) where αt|s = αt/αs and σ2 t|s = σ2 t −α2 t|sσ2 s. Substituting in the choices of Rissanen et al. (2022), αt = dt and σ(i) t = σ, then gives αt|s = dt/ds and σ2 t|s = (1 − (dt/ds)2)σ2. (16) Note that if dt is chosen so that it contains lower values for higher frequencies, then σt|s will add more noiseon the higher frequenciesper timestep. The heat dissipation model thus destroys information more quickly for those frequencies as compared to standard diffusion. 4Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Figure 2: A blurring diffusion process with latent variable z0, . . . ,z1 is diagonal (meaning can be factorized over dimensions) in frequency space, under the change of variable ut = VTzt. This results in a corresponding diffusion process in frequency space u0, . . . ,u1. Denoising Process Using again the results from Section 2.1, we can find an analytic expression for the inverse heat dissipation process: q(us|ut, x) = N(us|µt→s, σ2 t→s), (17) where σ2 t→s =   1 σ2s + α2 t|s σ2 t|s !−1 and µt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s ut + αs σ2s ux ! . (18) Except for ux, we can again plug in the expressions derived above in terms of dt, σ2. The analysis in Section 2.1 then allows predicting ϵt using a neural network to complete the model, as is done in standard denoising diffusion models. In comparison (Rissanen et al., 2022) predict µt→s directly, which is theoretically equally general but has been found to lead to inferior sample quality. Further- more, they instead chose to use a single scalar value for σ2 t→s for all time-steps: the downside of this is that it loses the guarantee of correctness as s → t as described in Section 2.1. 4 B LURRING DIFFUSION MODELS In this section we propose Blurring Diffusion Models. Using the analysis from Section 3, we can define this model in frequency space as a Gaussian diffusion model, with different schedules for the dimensions. Blurring diffusion places more on emphasis low frequencies which are visually more important, and it may also avoid over-fitting to high frequencies. It is important how the model is parametrized and what the specific schedules for αt and σt are. Different from traditional models, the diffusion process is defined in a frequency space: q(ut|ux) = N(ut|αtux, σ2 t I) (19) and different frequencies may diffuse at a different rate, which is controlled by the values in the vec- tors αt, σt (although we will end up picking the same scalar value for all dimensions in σt). Recall that the denoising distribution is then given by q(us|ut, x) = N(us|µt→s, σ2 t→s) as specified in Equation 17. Learning and Parametrization An important reason for the performance of modern diffusion models is the parametrization. Learning µt→s directly turns out to be difficult for neural networks and instead an approximation for x is learned which is plugged into the denoising distributions, often indirectly via an epsilon parametrization (Ho et al., 2020). Studying the re-parametrization of Equation 19: ut = αtux + σtuϵ,t where ux = VTx and uϵ,t = VTϵt (20) and take that as inspiration for the way we parametrize our model: \u0010 ut − σt ˆuϵ,t \u0011 /αt = ˆux, (21) 5Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Algorithm 1Generating Samples Sample zT ∼ N(0, I) for t in {T T , . . . ,1 T } where s = t − 1/T do ut = VTz and ˆuϵ,t = VTfθ(z, t) Compute σt→s and ˆµt→s with Eq. 18, 23 Sample ϵ ∼ N(0, I) z ← V(ˆµt→s + σt→sϵ) Algorithm 2Optimizing Blurring Diffusion Sample t ∼ U(0, 1) Sample ϵ ∼ N(0, I) Minimize ||ϵ − fθ(VαtVTx + σtϵ, t)||2 which is the blurring diffusion counterpart of Equation 6 from standard diffusion models. Although it is convenient to express our diffusion and denoising processes in frequency space, neural networks have been optimized to work well in standard pixel space. It is for this reason that the neural network fθ takes as input zt = Vut and predicts ˆϵt. After prediction we can always easily transition back and forth between frequency space if needed using the DCT matrix VT and inverse DCT matrix V. This is how ˆuϵ,t = VTˆϵt is obtained. Using this parametrization for ˆx and after transforming to frequency space ˆux = VT ˆx we can compute ˆµt→s using Equation 18 where ux is replaced by the prediction ˆux to give: p(us|ut) = q(us|ut, ˆux) = N(us|ˆµt→s, σt→s) (22) for which ˆµt→s can be simplified further in terms of ˆuϵ,t instead of ˆux: ˆµt→s = σ2 t→s   αt|s σ2 t|s ut + 1 αt|sσ2s (ut − σt ˆuϵ,t) ! . (23) Optimization Following the literature (Ho et al., 2020) we optimize an unweighted squared error in pixel space: L = Et∼U(0,1)Eϵt∼N(0,I)[||fθ(zt, t) − ϵt||2], where zt = V(αtVTxt + σtVTϵt). (24) Alternatively, one can derive a variational bound objective which corresponds to a different weight- ing as explained in section 2.1. However, it is known that such objectives tend to result in inferior sample quality (Ho et al., 2020; Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021). Noise and Blurring SchedulesTo specify the blurring process precisely, the schedules forαt, σt need to be defined for t ∈ [0, 1]. For σt we choose the same value for all frequencies, so it suffices to give a schedule for a scalar value σt. The schedules are constructed by combining a typical Gaussian noise diffusion schedule (specified by scalars at, σt) with a blurring schedule (specified by the vectors dt). For the noise schedule, following (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) we choose a variance preserving cosine schedule meaning that σ2 t = 1−a2 t , where at = cos(tπ/2) for t ∈ [0, 1]. To avoid instabilities when t → 0 and t → 1, the log signal to noise ratio (log a2 t /σ2 t ) is at maximum +10 for t = 0 and at least −10 for t = 1. See (Kingma et al., 2021) for more details regarding the relation between the signal to noise ratio and at, σt. For the blurring schedule, we use the relation from (Rissanen et al., 2022) that a Gaussian blur with scale σB corresponds to dissipation with time τ = σ2 B/2. Empirically we found the blurring schedule: σB,t = σB,max sin(tπ/2)2 (25) to work well, where σB,max is a tune-able hyperparameter that corresponds to the maximum blur that will be applied to the image. This schedule in turn defines the dissipation time via τt = σ2 B,t/2. As described in Equation 23, the denoising process divides elementwise by the termαt|s = αt/αs. If one would naively use dt = exp(−λτt) for αt and equivalently for step s, then the term dt/ds could contain very small values for high frequencies. As a result, an undesired side-effect is that small errors may be amplified by many steps of the denoising process. Therefore, we modify the procedure slightly and let: dt = (1 − dmin) · exp(−λτt) + dmin, (26) where we set dmin = 0.001. This blurring transformation damps frequencies to a small value dmin and at the same time the denoising process amplifies high frequencies less aggressively. Because 6Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 (Rissanen et al., 2022) did not use the denoising process, this modification was not necessary for their model. Combining the Gaussian noise schedule ( at, σt) with the blurring schedule ( dt) we obtain: αt = at · dt and σt = 1σt, (27) where 1 is a vector of ones. See Appendix A for more details on the implementation and specific settings. 4.1 A NOTE ON THE GENERALITY In general, an orthogonal base ux = VTx that has a diagonal diffusion process q(ut|ux) = N(ut|αtux, σ2 t I) corresponds to the following process in pixel space: q(zt|x) =N(zt|Vdiag(αt)VTx, Vdiag(σ2 t )VT) where ut = VTzt, (28) where diag transforms a vector to a diagonal matrix. More generally, a diffusion process defined in any invertible basis change ux = P−1x corresponds to the following diffusion process in pixel space: q(zt|x) =N(zt|Pdiag(αt)P−1x, Pdiag(σ2 t )PT) where ut = P−1zt. (29) As such, this framework enables a larger class of diffusion models,with the guarantees of standard diffusion models. 5 R ELATED WORK Score-based diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020) have become increasingly successfully in modelling different types of data, such as images (Dhari- wal & Nichol, 2021), audio (Kong et al., 2021), and steady states of physical systems (Xu et al., 2022). Most diffusion processes are diagonal, meaning that they can be factorized over dimensions. The vast majority relies on independent additive isotropic Gaussian noise as a diffusion process. Several diffusion models use a form of super-resolution to account for the multi-scale properties in images (Ho et al., 2022; Jing et al., 2022). These methods still rely on additive isotropic Gaussian noise, but have explicit transitions between different resolutions. In other works (Serrà et al., 2022; Kawar et al., 2022) diffusion models are used to restore predefined corruptions on image or audio data, although these models do not generate data from scratch. Theis et al. (2022) discuss non- isotropic Gaussian diffusion processes in the context of lossy compression. They find that non- isotropic Gaussian diffusion, such as our blurring diffusion models, can lead to improved results if the goal is to encode data with minimal mean-squared reconstruction loss under a reconstruction model that is constrained to obey the ground truth marginal data distribution, though the benefit over standard isotropic diffusion is greater for different objectives. Recently, several works introduce other destruction processes as an alternative to Gaussian diffusion with little to no noise. Although pre-existing works invert fixed amounts of blur (Kupyn et al., 2018; Whang et al., 2022), in (Rissanen et al., 2022) blurring is directly built into the diffusion process via heat dissipation. Similarly, in (Bansal et al., 2022) several (possibly deterministic) destruction mechanisms are proposed which are referred to as ‘cold diffusion’. However, the generative pro- cesses of these approaches may not be able to properly learn the reveres process if they do not satisfy the condition discussed in section 2.1. Furthermore in (Lee et al., 2022) a process is introduced that combines blurring and noise and is variance preserving in frequency space, which may not be the ideal inductive bias for images. Concurrently, in (Daras et al., 2022) a method is introduced that can incorporate blurring with noise, although sampling is done differently. For all these approaches, there is still a considerably gap in performance compared to standard denoising diffusion. 6 E XPERIMENTS 6.1 C OMPARISON WITH DETERMINISTIC AND DENOISING DIFFUSION MODELS In this section our proposed Blurring Diffusion Models are compared to their closest competitor in literature, IHDMs (Rissanen et al., 2022), and to Cold Diffusion Models (Bansal et al., 2022). In addition, they are also compared to a denoising diffusion baseline similar to DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020) which we refer to as Denoising Diffusion. 7Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 1: Sample quality on CIFAR10 mea- sured in FID score, lower is better.

CIFAR10 The first generation task is generating im- ages when trained on the CIFAR10 dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). For this task, we run the blurring diffu- sion model and the denoising diffusion baseline both us- ing the same UNet architecture as their noise predictor fθ. Specifically, the UNet operates at resolutions32×32, 16 ×16 and 8 ×8 with 256 channels at each level. At ev- ery resolution, the UNet has 3 residual blocks associated with the down-sampling section and another 3 blocks for the up-sampling section. Furthermore, the UNet has self- attention at resolutions 16 × 16 and 8 × 8 with a single head. Although IHDMs used only 128 channels on the 32 × 32 resolutions, they use 256 channels on all other resolutions, they include the 4 × 4 resolution and use 4 blocks instead of 3 blocks. Also see Appendix A.2. To measure the visual quality of the generated samples we use the FID score measured on 50000 samples drawn from the models, after 2 million steps of training. As can be seen from these scores (Table 1), the blurring diffusion models are able to generate images with a considerable higher quality than IHDMs, as well as other similar approaches in literature. Our blurring diffusion models also outperform standard denoising diffusion models, although the difference in performance is less pronounced in that case. Random samples drawn from the model are depicted in Figure 3. Figure 4: Samples from a Blurring Diffusion model trained on LSUN churches 128× 128. LSUN Churches Secondly, we test the perfor- mance of the model when trained on LSUN Churches with a resolution of 128 × 128. Again, a UNet architecture is used for the noise predic- tion network fθ. This time the UNet operates on 64 channels for the 128 × 128 resolution, 128 chan- nels for the 64 × 64 resolution, 256 channels for the 32×32 resolution, 384 channels for the 16×16 res- olution, and 512 channels for the 8×8 resolution. At each resolution there are two sections with3 residual blocks, with self-attention on the resolutions32×32, 16 × 16, and 8 × 8. The models in (Rissanen et al., 2022) use more channels at each resolution level but only 2 residual blocks (see Appendix A.2). The visual quality is measured by computing the FID score on 10000 samples drawn from trained mod- els. From these scores (Table 2) again we see that the blurring diffusion models generate higher qual- ity images than IHDMs. Furthermore, Blurring Dif- fusion models also outperform denoising diffusion models, although again the difference in performance is smaller in that comparison. See Appendix B for more experiments. 8Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Table 3: Blurring Diffusion Models with dif- ferent maximum noise values σB,max CIFAR10 LSUN Churches (128×) 0 3.60 4.68 1 3.49 4.42 10 3.26 3.65 20 3.17 3.88 Table 4: Different maximum noise levels and schedules on CIFAR10 σB,max σB,maxsin(tπ/2)2 σB,maxsin(tπ/2) 0 3.60 3.58 1 3.49 3.37 10 3.26 4.24 20 3.17 6.54 6.2 C OMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT NOISE LEVELS AND SCHEDULES In this section we analyze the models from above, but with different settings in terms of maximum blur (σB,max) and two different noise schedule ( sin2 and sin). The models where σB,max = 0 are equivalent to a standard denoising diffusion model. For CIFAR10, the best performing model uses a blur of σB,max = 20 which has an FID of 3.17 over 3.60 when no blur is applied, as can be seen in Table 3. The difference compared to the model with σB,max = 10 is relatively small, with an FID of 3.26. For LSUN Churches, the the best performing model uses a little less blurσB,max = 10 although performance is again relatively close to the model with σB,max = 20. When comparing the sin2 schedule with a sin schedule, the visual quality measured by FID score seems to be much better for the sin2 schedule (Table 4). In fact, for higher maximum blur the sin2 schedule performs much better. Our hypothesis is that the sin schedule blurs too aggressively, whereas the graph of a sin2 adds blur more gradually at the beginning of the diffusion process near t = 0. Interesting behaviour of blurring diffusion models is that models with higher maximum blur (σB,max) converge more slowly, but when trained long enough outperform models with less blur. When comparing two blurring models withσB,max set to either1 or 20, the model withσB,max = 20 has better visual quality only after roughly 200K training steps for CIFAR10 and 1M training steps for LSUN churches. It seems that higher blur takes more time to train, but then learns to fit the data better. Note that an exception was made for the evaluation of the CIFAR10 models whereσB,max is 0 and 1, as those models show over-fitting behaviour and have better FID at 1 million steps than at 2 million steps. Regardless of this selection advantage, they are outperformed by blurring diffusion models with higher σB,max. 7 L IMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION In this paper we introduced blurring diffusion models, a class of generative models generalizing over the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) of Ho et al. (2020) and the Inverse Heat Dissipation Models (IHDM) of Rissanen et al. (2022). In doing so, we showed that blurring data, and several other such deterministic transformations with addition of fixed variance Gaussian noise, can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. This allowed us to make connections to the literature on non-isotropic diffusion models (e.g. Theis et al., 2022), which allows us to better understand the inductive bias imposed by this model class. Using our proposed model class, we were able to generate images with improved perceptual quality compared to both DDPM and IHDM baselines. A limitation of blurring diffusion models is that the use of blur has a regularizing effect: When using blur it takes longer to train a generative model to convergence. Such as regularizing effect is often beneficial, and can lead to improved sample quality as we showed in Section 6, but may not be desirable when very large quantities of training data are available. As we discuss in Section 4, the expected benefit of blurring is also dependent on our particular objective, and will differ for different ways of measuring sample quality: We briefly explored this in Section 6, but we leave a more exhaustive exploration of the tradeoffs in this model class for future work. 9Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 REFERENCES Arpit Bansal, Eitan Borgnia, Hong-Min Chu, Jie S.

OpenReview.net, 2022. 11Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 A A DDITIONAL DETAILS ON BLURRING DIFFUSION In this section we provide additional details for blurring diffusion models. In particular, we provide some pseudo-code to show the essential steps that are needed to compute the variables associated with the diffusion process. A.1 P SEUDO -CODE OF DIFFUSION AND DENOISING PROCESS Firstly, the procedure to compute the frequency scaling (dt) is given below: def get_frequency_scaling (t, min_scale =0.001): # compute dissipation time sigma_blur = sigma_blur_max * sin (t * pi / 2)^2 dissipation_time = sigma_t ^2 / 2 # compute frequencies freq = pi * linspace (0 , img_dim -1 , img_dim ) / img_dim labda = freqs [None , :, None , None ]^2 + freqs [None , None , :, None ]^2 # compute scaling for frequencies scaling = exp (- labda * dissipation_time ) * (1 - min_scale ) scaling = scaling + min_scale return scaling Note here the computation of Λ is from (Rissanen et al., 2022) and the variable ‘scaling’ refers to dt in equations. Next, we can define a wrapper function to return the required αt, σt values. def get_alpha_sigma (t): freq_scaling = get_frequency_scaling (t) a, sigma = get_noise_scaling_cosine (t) alpha = a * freq_scaling # Combine dissipation and scaling . return alpha , sigma Which also requires a function to obtain the noise parameters. We use a typical cosine schedule for which the pseudo-code is given below: def get_noise_schaling_cosine (t, logsnr_min = -10 , logsnr_max =10): limit_max = arctan ( exp ( -0.5 * logsnr_max )) limit_min = arctan ( exp ( -0.5 * logsnr_min )) - limit_max logsnr = -2 * log ( tan ( limit_min * t + limit_max )) # Transform logsnr to a, sigma . return sqrt ( sigmoid ( logsnr )) , sqrt ( sigmoid (- logsnr )) To train the model we desire samples from q(ut|ux). In the pseudo-code below, the inputs (x) and outputs (zt, ϵt) are defined in pixel space. Recall that zt = Vut = IDCT(ut) and then: def diffuse (x, t): x_freq = DCT (x) alpha , sigma = get_alpha_sigma (t) eps = random_normal_like (x) # Since we chose sigma to be a scalar , eps does not need to be # passed through a DCT / IDCT in this case . z_t = IDCT ( alpha * x_freq ) + sigma * eps return z_t , eps Given samples zt from the diffusion process one can now directly define the mean squared error loss on epsilon as defined below: 12Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 def loss (x): t = random_uniform (0 , 1) z_t , eps = diffuse (x, t) error = ( eps - neural_net (z_t , t ))^2 return mean ( error ) Finally, to sample from the model we repeatedly sample fromp(zt−1/T |zt) for the grid of timesteps t = T, T− 1/T . . . ,1/T. def denoise (z_t , t, delta =1e -8): alpha_s , sigma_s = get_alpha_sigma (t - 1 / T) alpha_t , sigma_t = get_alpha_sigma (t) # Compute helpful coefficients . alpha_ts = alpha_t / alpha_s alpha_st = 1 / alpha_ts sigma2_ts = ( sigma_t ^2 - alpha_ts ^2 * sigma_s ^2) # Denoising variance . sigma2_denoise = 1 / clip ( 1 / clip ( sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ) + 1 / clip ( sigma_t ^2 / alpha_ts ^2 - sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ), min = delta ) # The coefficients for u_t and u_eps . coeff_term1 = alpha_ts * sigma2_denoise / ( sigma2_ts + delta ) coeff_term2 = alpha_st * sigma2_denoise / clip ( sigma_s ^2 , min = delta ) # Get neural net prediction . hat_eps = neural_net (z_t , t) # Compute terms . u_t = DCT ( z_t ) term1 = IDCT ( coeff_term1 * u_t ) term2 = IDCT ( coeff_term2 * ( u_t - sigma_t * DCT ( hat_eps ))) mu_denoise = term1 + term2 # Sample from the denoising distribution . eps = random_normal_like ( mu_denoise ) return mu_denoise + IDCT ( sqrt ( sigma2_denoise ) * eps ) More efficient implementations that use less DCT calls are also possible when the denoising function is directly defined in frequency space. This is not really an issue however, because compared to the neural network the DCTs are relatively cheap. Additionally, several values are clipped to a minimum of 10−8 to avoid numerically unstable divisions. In the sampling process of standard diffusion, before using the prediction ˆϵ the variable is trans- formed to ˆx, clipped and then transformed back to ˆϵ. This procedure is known to improve visual quality scores for standard denoising diffusion, but it is not immediately clear how to apply the tech- nique in the case of blurring diffusion. For future research, finding a reliable technique to perform clipping without introducing frequency artifacts may be important. A.2 H YPERPARAMETER SETTINGS In the experiments, the neural network function ( fθ in equations) is implemented as a UNet archi- tecture, as is typical in modern diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020). For the specific architecture details see Table 5. Note that as is standard in UNet architectures, there is an downsample and up- sample path. Following the common notation, the hyperparameter ‘ResBlocks / Stage’ denotes the blocks per stage per upsample/downsample path. Thus, a level with 3 ResBlocks per stage as in total 3 + (3 + 1) = 7ResBlocks, where the (3 + 1)originates from the upsample path which always uses an additional block. In addition, the downsample / upsample blocks also apply an additional ResBlock. All models where optimized with Adam, with a learning rate of 2 · 10−4 and batch size 13Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 128 for CIFAR-10 and a learning rate of 1 · 10−4 and batch size 256 for the LSUN models. All methods are evaluated with an exponential moving average computed with a decay of 0.9999.

In Table 6 the FID score on the eval set of CIFAR10 and LSUN churches128 × 128 is presented. The best performing models match with the results in the main text on train FID. For CIFAR10, we also report the Inception Score which corresponds to the certainty of the Inception classifier. Here the results are less clear, because all models have roughly similar scores. The best performing model uses σB,max = 10 and achieves 9.59. To confirm that the loss and parametrization are important, the best CIFAR10 model (with σB,max = 20 ) is trained using a mean squared error on x − ˆx when predicting ˆx, but this only achieves 23.9 FID versus the 3.17 of the epsilon parametrization. This diminished performance is also observed for standard diffusion (Ho et al., 2020). Furthermore, as an ablation study we trained the best performing model in the frequency domain (where the UNet takes as input ut). This model only produced gray samples with some checkerboard artifacts, and had a higher loss throughout training. This indicates that learning a UNet directly in frequency space is not straightforward.

Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2208.09392v1  [cs.CV]  19 Aug 20221 Introduction Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling [Ramesh et al., 2022]. Diffusion models come in many ﬂavors, but all are built around the concept of random noise removal; one trains an image restoration/denoising network that accepts an image contaminated with Gaussian noise, and outputs a denoised image. At test time, the denoising network is used to convert pure Gaussian noise into a photo-realistic image using an update rule that alternates between applying the denoiser and adding Gaussian noise. When the right sequence of updates is applied, complex generative behavior is observed. The origins of diffusion models, and also our theoretical understanding of these models, are strongly based on the role played by Gaussian noise during training and generation. Diffusion has been understood as a random walk around the image density function using Langevin dynamics [Sohl- Dickstein et al., 2015, Song and Ermon, 2019], which requires Gaussian noise in each step. The walk begins in a high temperature (heavy noise) state, and slowly anneals into a “cold” state with little if any noise. Another line of work derives the loss for the denoising network using variational inference with a Gaussian prior [Ho et al., 2020, Song et al., 2021a, Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021]. In this work, we examine the need for Gaussian noise, or any randomness at all, for diffusion models to work in practice. We consider generalized diffusion models that live outside the conﬁnes of the theoretical frameworks from which diffusion models arose. Rather than limit ourselves to models built around Gaussian noise, we consider models built around arbitrary image transformations like blurring, downsampling, etc. We train a restoration network to invert these deformations using a simple ℓp loss. When we apply a sequence of updates at test time that alternate between the image restoration model and the image degradation operation, generative behavior emerges, and we obtain photo-realistic images. The existence of cold diffusions that require no Gaussian noise (or any randomness) during training or testing raises questions about the limits of our theoretical understanding of diffusion models. It also unlocks the door for potentially new types of generative models with very different properties than conventional diffusion seen so far. 2 Background Generative models exist for a range of modalities spanning natural language [Brown et al., 2020] and images [Brock et al., 2019, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021], and they can be extended to solve important problems such as image restoration [Kawar et al., 2021a, 2022]. While GANs [Goodfellow et al., 2014] have historically been the tool of choice for image synthesis [Brock et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2019], diffusion models [Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015] have recently become competitive if not superior for some applications [Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Nichol et al., 2021, Ramesh et al., 2021, Meng et al., 2021]. Both the Langevin dynamics and variational inference interpretations of diffusion models rely on properties of the Gaussian noise used in the training and sampling pipelines. From the score-matching generative networks perspective [Song and Ermon, 2019, Song et al., 2021b], noise in the training process is critically thought to expand the support of the low-dimensional training distribution to a set of full measure in ambient space. The noise is also thought to act as data augmentation to improve score predictions in low density regions, allowing for mode mixing in the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampling. The gradient signal in low-density regions can be further improved during sampling by injecting large magnitudes of noise in the early steps of SGLD and gradually reducing this noise in later stages. Kingma et al. [2021] propose a method to learn a noise schedule that leads to faster optimization. Using a classic statistical result, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli [2021] show the connection between removing additive Gaussian noise and the gradient of the log of the noisy signal density in determin- istic linear inverse problems. Here, we shed light on the role of noise in diffusion models through theoretical and empirical results in applications to inverse problems and image generation. Iterative neural models have been used for various inverse problems [Romano et al., 2016, Metzler et al., 2017]. Recently, diffusion models have been applied to them [Song et al., 2021b] for the 2problems of deblurring, denoising, super-resolution, and compressive sensing [Whang et al., 2021, Kawar et al., 2021b, Saharia et al., 2021, Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli, 2021]. Although not their focus, previous works on diffusion models have included experiments with deterministic image generation [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021] and in selected inverse problems [Kawar et al., 2022]. Here, we show deﬁnitively that noise is not a necessity in diffusion models, and we observe the effects of removing noise for a number of inverse problems. Despite proliﬁc work on generative models in recent years, methods to probe the properties of learned distributions and measure how closely they approximate the real training data are by no means closed ﬁelds of investigation. Indirect feature space similarity metrics such as Inception Score [Salimans et al., 2016], Mode Score [Che et al., 2016], Frechet inception distance (FID) [Heusel et al., 2017], and Kernel inception distance (KID) [Bi´nkowski et al., 2018] have been proposed and adopted to some extent, but they have notable limitations [Barratt and Sharma, 2018]. To adopt a popular frame of reference, we will use FID as the feature similarity metric for our experiments. 3 Generalized Diffusion Standard diffusion models are built around two components. First, there is an image degradation operator that contaminates images with Gaussian noise. Second, a trained restoration operator is created to perform denoising. The image generation process alternates between the application of these two operators. In this work, we consider the construction of generalized diffusions built around arbitrary degradation operations. These degradations can be randomized (as in the case of standard diffusion) or deterministic. 3.1 Model components and training Given an image x0 ∈RN, consider the degradation of x0 by operator Dwith severity t,denoted xt = D(x0,t). The output distribution D(x0,t) of the degradation should vary continuously in t, and the operator should satisfy D(x0,0) = x0. In the standard diffusion framework, Dadds Gaussian noise with variance proportional to t. In our generalized formulation, we choose Dto perform various other transformations such as blurring, masking out pixels, downsampling, and more, with severity that depends on t. We explore a range of choices for Din Section 4. We also require a restoration operator R that (approximately) inverts D. This operator has the property that R(xt,t) ≈x0. In practice, this operator is implemented via a neural network parameterized by θ. The restoration network is trained via the minimization problem min θ Ex∼X∥Rθ(D(x,t),t) −x∥, (1) where xdenotes a random image sampled from distribution Xand ∥·∥ denotes a norm, which we take to be ℓ1 in our experiments. We have so far used the subscript Rθ to emphasize the dependence of Ron θduring training, but we will omit this symbol for simplicity in the discussion below. 3.2 Sampling from the model After choosing a degradation Dand training a model Rto perform the restoration, these operators can be used in tandem to invert severe degradations by using standard methods borrowed from the diffusion literature. For small degradations (t≈0), a single application of Rcan be used to obtain a restored image in one shot. However, because Ris typically trained using a simple convex loss, it yields blurry results when used with large t. Rather, diffusion models [Song et al., 2021a, Ho et al., 2020] perform generation by iteratively applying the denoising operator and then adding noise back to the image, with the level of added noise decreasing over time. This corresponds to the standard update sequence in Algorithm 1. 3Algorithm 1 Naive Sampling Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = D(ˆx0,s −1) end for Return: x0 Algorithm 2 Improved Sampling for Cold Diffusion Input: A degraded sample xt for s = t,t −1,..., 1 do ˆx0 ←R(xs,s) xs−1 = xs −D(ˆx0,s) + D(ˆx0,s −1) end for When the restoration operator is perfect, i.e. when R(D(x0,t),t) = x0 for all t,one can easily see that Algorithm 1 produces exact iterates of the form xs = D(x0,s). But what happens for imperfect restoration op- erators? In this case, errors can cause the iterates xs to wander away from D(x0,s), and inaccurate reconstruction may occur. We ﬁnd that the standard sampling ap- proach in Algorithm 1 works well for noise-based diffusion, possibly because the restoration operator R has been trained to correct (random Gaussian) errors in its inputs. However, we ﬁnd that it yields poor results in the case of cold diffusions with smooth/differentiable degradations as demonstrated for a deblurring model in Figure 2. We propose Algorithm 2 for sampling, which we ﬁnd to be superior for inverting smooth, cold degradations. This sampler has important mathematical properties that enable it to recover high quality results. Speciﬁcally, for a class of linear degradation operations, it can be shown to produce exact reconstruc- tion (i.e. xs = D(x0,s)) even when the restoration operator Rfails to perfectly invert D. We discuss this in the following section. 3.3 Properties of Algorithm 2 Figure 2: Comparison of sampling methods for cold diffusion on the CelebA dataset. Top: Algorithm 1 produces compounding artifacts and fails to generate a new image. Bottom: Algorithm 2 succeeds in sam- pling a high quality image without noise. It is clear from inspection that both Algo- rithms 1 and 2 perfectly reconstruct the it- erate xs = D(x0,s) for all s < tif the restoration operator is a perfect inverse for the degradation operator. In this section, we analyze the stability of these algorithms to errors in the restoration operator. For small values of xand s, Algorithm 2 is extremely tolerant of error in the restoration operator R. To see why, consider a model problem with a linear degradation function of the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·efor some vector e. While this ansatz may seem rather restrictive, note that the Taylor expansion of any smooth degradation D(x,s) around x = x0,s = 0 has the form D(x,s) ≈x+ s·e+ HOT where HOT denotes higher order terms. Note that the constant/zeroth-order term in this Taylor expansion is zero because we assumed above that the degradation operator satisﬁes D(x,0) = x. For a degradation of the form (3.3) and any restoration operator R, the update in Algorithm 2 can be written xs−1 = xs −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = D(x0,s) −D(R(xs,s),s) + D(R(xs,s),s −1) = x0 + s·e−R(xs,s) −s·e+ R(xs,s) + (s−1) ·e = x0 + (s−1) ·e = D(x0,s −1) By induction, we see that the algorithm produces the value xs = D(x0,s) for all s<t, regardless of the choice of R. In other words, for any choice of R, the iteration behaves the same as it would when Ris a perfect inverse for the degradation D. By contrast, Algorithm 1 does not enjoy this behavior. In fact, when Ris not a perfect inverse for D, x0 is not even a ﬁxed point of the update rule in Algorithm 1 becausex0 ̸= D(R(x,0),0) = R(x,0). If Rdoes not perfectly invert Dwe should expect Algorithm 1 to incur errors, even for small values 4of s. Meanwhile, for small values of s, the behavior of Dapproaches its ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion and Algorithm 2 becomes immune to errors in R. We demonstrate the stability of Algorithm 2 vs Algorithm 1 on a deblurring model in Figure 2. 4 Generalized Diffusions with Various Transformations In this section, we take the ﬁrst step towards cold diffusion by reversing different degradations and hence performing conditional generation. We will extend our methods to perform unconditional (i.e. from scratch) generation in Section 5. We emprically evaluate generalized diffusion models trained on different degradations with our improved sampling Algorithm 2. We perform experiments on the vision tasks of deblurring, inpainting, super-resolution, and the unconventional task of synthetic snow removal. We perform our experiments on MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], CIFAR-10 [Krizhevsky, 2009], and CelebA [Liu et al., 2015]. In each of these tasks, we gradually remove the information from the clean image, creating a sequence of images such that D(x0,t) retains less information than D(x0,t −1). For these different tasks, we present both qualitative and quantitative results on a held-out testing dataset and demonstrate the importance of the sampling technique described in Algorithm 2. For all quantitative results in this section, the Frechet inception distance (FID) scores [Heusel et al., 2017] for degraded and reconstructed images are measured with respect to the testing data. Additional information about the quantitative results, convergence criteria, hyperparameters, and architecture of the models presented below can be found in the appendix. 4.1 Deblurring We consider a generalized diffusion based on a Gaussian blur operation (as opposed to Gaussian noise) in which an image at stepthas more blur than att−1. The forward process given the Gaussian kernels {Gs}and the image xt−1 at step t−1 can thus be written as xt = Gt ∗xt−1 = Gt ∗... ∗G1 ∗x0 = ¯Gt ∗x0 = D(x0,t), (2) where ∗denotes the convolution operator, which blurs an image using a kernel. We train a deblurring model by minimizing the loss (1), and then use Algorithm 2 to invert this blurred diffusion process for which we trained a DNN to predict the clean image ˆx0. Qualitative results are shown in Figure 3 and quantitative results in Table 1. Qualitatively, we can see that images created using the sampling process are sharper and in some cases completely different as compared to the direct reconstruction of the clean image. Quantitatively we can see that the reconstruction metrics such as RMSE and PSNR get worse when we use the sampling process, but on the other hand FID with respect to held-out test data improves. The qualitative improvements and decrease in FID show the beneﬁts of the generalized sampling routine, which brings the learned distribution closer to the true data manifold. In the case of blur operator, the sampling routine can be thought of adding frequencies at each step. This is because the sampling routine involves the term D( ˆx0,t) −D( ˆx0,t −1) which in the case of blur becomes ¯Gt ∗x0 −¯Gt−1 ∗x0. This results in a difference of Gaussians, which is a band pass ﬁlter and contains frequencies that were removed at step t. Thus, in the sampling process, we sequentially add the frequencies that were removed during the degradation process. Degraded Direct Alg.

We remove pixels using a Gaussian mask as follows: For input images of size n×nwe start with a 2D Gaussian curve of variance β,discretized into an n×narray. We normalize so the peak of the curve has value 1, and subtract the result from 1 so the center of the mask as value 0. We randomize the location of the Gaussian mask for MNIST and CIFAR-10, but keep it centered for CelebA. We denote the ﬁnal mask by zβ. Input images x0 are iteratively masked for T steps via multiplication with a sequence of masks {zβi } with increasing βi. We can control the amount of information removed at each step by tuning the βi parameter. In the language of Section 3, D(x0,t) = x0 ·∏t i=1 zβi , where the operator ·denotes entry-wise multiplication. Figure 4 presents results on test images and compares the output of the inpainting model to the original image. The reconstructed images display reconstructed features qualitatively consistent with the context provided by the unperturbed regions of the image. We quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the inpainting models on each of the datasets by comparing distributional similarity metrics before and after the reconstruction. Our results are summarized in Table 2. Note, the FID scores here are computed with respect to the held-out validation set.

This takes place, once for each values of t, until a ﬁnal resolution is reached, 4 ×4 in the case of MNIST and CIFAR-10 and 2 ×2 in the case of Celeb-A. After each down-sampling, the lower- resolution image is resized to the original image size, using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Figure 5 presents example testing data inputs for all datasets and compares the output of the super-resolution model to the original image.

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that generalized diffusion can succeed even with exotic transforms that lack the scale-space and compositional properties of blur operators. Similar to other tasks, we degrade the images by adding snow, such that the level of snow increases with step t. We provide more implementation details in Appendix. We illustrate our desnowiﬁcation results in Figure 6. We present testing examples, as well as their snowiﬁed images, from all the datasets, and compare the desnowiﬁed results with the original images. The desnowiﬁed images feature near-perfect reconstruction results for CIFAR-10 examples with lighter snow, and exhibit visually distinctive restoration for Celeb-A examples with heavy snow. We provide quantitative results in Table 4. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 6: Desnowiﬁcation models trained on the CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: de- graded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. 5 Cold Generation Diffusion models can successfully learn the underlying distribution of training data, and thus generate diverse, high quality images [Song et al., 2021a, Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021, Jolicoeur-Martineau et al., 2021, Ho et al., 2022]. We will ﬁrst discuss deterministic generation using Gaussian noise 7Table 4: Quantitative metrics for quality of image reconstruction using desnowiﬁcation models.

Finally, we provide a proof of concept that the Algorithm 2 can be extended to other degradations. 5.1 Generation using deterministic noise degradation Here we discuss image generation using noise-based degradation. We consider “deterministic” sampling in which the noise pattern is selected and frozen at the start of the generation process, and then treated as a constant. We study two ways of applying Algorithm 2 with ﬁxed noise. We ﬁrst deﬁne D(x,t) = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz, as the (deterministic) interpolation between data point xand a ﬁxed noise pattern z∈N(0,1), for increasing αt <αt−1, ∀1 ≤t≤T as in Song et al. [2021a]. Algorithm 2 can be applied in this case by ﬁxing the noise zused in the degradation operatorD(x,s). Alternatively, one can deterministically calculate the noise vector zto be used in step tof reconstruction by using the formula ˆz(xt,t) = xt −√αtR(xt,t)√1 −αt . The second method turns out to be closely related to the deterministic sampling proposed in Song et al. [2021a], with some differences in the formulation of the training objective. We discuss this relationship in detail in Appendix A.6. We present quantitative results for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using the ﬁxed noise method and the estimated noise method (using ˆz) in Table 5. 5.2 Image generation using blur The forward diffusion process in noise-based diffusion models has the advantage that the degraded image distribution at the ﬁnal step T is simply an isotropic Gaussian. One can therefore perform (unconditional) generation by ﬁrst drawing a sample from the isotropic Gaussian, and sequentially denoising it with backward diffusion. When using blur as a degradation, the fully degraded images do not form a nice closed-form distribution that we can sample from. They do, however, form a simple enough distribution that can be modeled with simple methods. Note that every image x0 degenerates to an xT that is constant (i.e., every pixel is the same color) for largeT. Furthermore, the constant value is exactly the channel-wise mean of the RGB image x0, and can be represented with a 3-vector. This 3-dimensional distribution is easily represented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). This GMM can be sampled to produce the random pixel values of a severely blurred image, which can be deblurred using cold diffusion to create a new image. Our generative model uses a blurring schedule where we progressively blur each image with a Gaussian kernel of size 27x27 over 300 steps. The standard deviation of the kernel starts at 1 and increases exponentially at the rate of 0.01. We then ﬁt a simple GMM with one component to the distribution of channel-wise means. To generate an image from scratch, we sample the channel-wise mean from the GMM, expand the 3D vector into a 128 ×128 image with three channels, and then apply Algorithm 2. Empirically, the presented pipeline generates images with high ﬁdelity but low diversity, as reﬂected quantitatively by comparing the perfect symmetry column with results from hot diffusion in Table 5. We attribute this to the perfect correlation between pixels of xT sampled from the channel-wise mean Gaussian mixture model. To break the symmetry between pixels, we add a small amount of Gaussian noise (of standard deviation 0.002) to each sampled xT. As shown in Table 5, the simple trick drastically improves the quality of generated images. We also present the qualitative results for cold diffusion using blur transformation in Figure 7, and further discuss the necessity of Algorithm 2 8for generation in Appendix A.7. Table 5: FID scores for CelebA and AFHQ datasets using hot (using noise) and cold diffusion (using blur transformation). This table shows that This table also shows that breaking the symmetry withing pixels of the same channel further improves the FID scores.

Speciﬁcally, we show preliminary results on inpainting, super-resolution, and animorphosis. Inspired by the simplicity of the degraded image distribution for the blurring routine presented in the previous section, we use degradation routines with predictable ﬁnal distributions here as well. To use the Gaussian mask transformation for generation, we modify the masking routine so the ﬁnal degraded image is completely devoid of information. One might think a natural option is to send all of the images to a completely black image xT, but this would not allow for any diversity in generation. To get around this maximally non-injective property, we instead make the mask turn all pixels to a random, solid color. This still removes all of the information from the image, but it allows us to recover different samples from the learned distribution via Algorithm 2 by starting off with different color images. More formally, a Gaussian mask Gt = ∏t i=1 zβi is created in a similar way as discussed in the Section 4.2, but instead of multiplying it directly to the image x0, we create xt as follows: xt = Gt ∗x0 + (1 −Gt) ∗c where cis an image of a randomly sampled color. For super-resolution, the routine down-samples to a resolution of 2 ×2, or 4 values in each channel. These degraded images can be represented as one-dimensional vectors, and their distribution is modeled using one Gaussian distribution. Using the same methods described for generation using 9blurring described above, we sample from this Gaussian-ﬁtted distribution of the lower-dimensional degraded image space and pass this sampled point through the generation process trained on super- resolution data to create one output. Additionally to show one can invert nearly any transformation, we include a new transformation deemed animorphosis, where we iteratively transform a human face from CelebA to an animal face from AFHQ. Though we chose CelebA and AFHQ for our experimentation, in principle such interpolation can be done for any two initial data distributions. More formally, given an image xand a random image zsampled from the AFHQ manifold, xt can be written as follows: xt = √αtx+ √ 1 −αtz Note this is essentially the same as the noising procedure, but instead of adding noise we are adding a progressively higher weighted AFHQ image. In order to sample from the learned distribution, we sample a random image of an animal and use Algorithm 2 to reverse theanimorphosis transformation. We present results for the CelebA dataset, and hence the quantitative results in terms of FID scores for inpainting, super-resolution and animorphosis are 90.14, 92.91 and 48.51 respectively. We further show some qualitative samples in Figure 8, and in Figure 1. Figure 8: Preliminary demonstration of the generative abilities of other cold diffusins on the128×128 CelebA dataset. The top row is with animorphosis models, the middle row is with inpainting models, and the bottom row exhibits super-resolution models. 6 Conclusion Existing diffusion models rely on Gaussian noise for both forward and reverse processes. In this work, we ﬁnd that the random noise can be removed entirely from the diffusion model framework, and replaced with arbitrary transforms. In doing so, our generalization of diffusion models and their sampling procedures allows us to restore images afﬂicted by deterministic degradations such as blur, inpainting and downsampling. This framework paves the way for a more diverse landscape of diffusion models beyond the Gaussian noise paradigm. The different properties of these diffusions may prove useful for a range of applications, including image generation and beyond. References Shane Barratt and Rishi Sharma.

LOGAN: latent optimisation for generative adversarial networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00953, 2019. 12A Appendix A.1 Deblurring For the deblurring experiments, we train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The training was done on the batch size of 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995 which is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For the MNIST dataset, we blur recursively 40 times, with a discrete Gaussian kernel of size 11x11 and a standard deviation 7. In the case of CIFAR-10, we recursively blur with a Gaussian kernel of ﬁxed size 11x11, but at each step t, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is given by 0.01 ∗t+ 0.35. The blur routine for CelebA dataset involves blurring images with a Gaussian kernel of 15x15 and the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel grows exponentially with time tat the rate of 0.01. Figure 9 shows an additional nine images for each of MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Figures 19 and 20 show the iterative sampling process using a deblurring model for ten example images from each dataset. We further show 400 random images to demonstrate the qualitative results in the Figure 21. Degraded Direct Alg. Original Figure 9: Additional examples from deblurring models trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. A.2 Inpainting For the inpainting transformation, models were trained on different datasets with 60,000 gradient steps. The models were trained using Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2×10−5. We use batch size 64, and the gradients are accumulated after every 2 steps. The ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. This EMA model is updated after every 10 gradient steps. For all our inpainting experiments we use a randomized Gaussian mask and T = 50 with β1 = 1 and βi+1 = βi + 0.1. To avoid potential leakage of information due to ﬂoating point computation of the Gaussian mask, we discretize the masked image before passing it through the inpainting model. This was done by rounding all pixel values to the eight most signiﬁcant digits. 13Figure 11 shows nine additional inpainting examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 10 demonstrates an example of the iterative sampling process of an inpainting model for one image in each dataset. A.3 Super-Resolution We train the super-resolution model per Section 3.1 for 700,000 iterations. We use the Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. The batch size is 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an Exponential Moving Average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. The number of time-steps depends on the size of the input image and the ﬁnal image. For MNIST and for CIFAR10, the number of time steps is 3, as it takes three steps of halving the resolution to reduce the initial image down to 4 ×4. For CelebA, the number of time steps is 6 to reduce the initial image down to 2 ×2. For CIFAR10, we apply random crop and random horizontal ﬂip for regularization. Figure 13 shows an additional nine super-resolution examples on each of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Figure 12 shows one example of the progressive increase in resolution achieved with the sampling process using a super-resolution model for each dataset. A.4 Colorization Here we provide results for the additional task of colorization. Starting with the original RGB- image x0, we realize colorization by iteratively desaturating for T steps until the ﬁnal image xT is a fully gray-scale image. We use a series of three-channel 1 ×1 convolution ﬁlters z(α) = {z1(α),z2(α),z3(α)}with the form z1(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (1 0 0) z2(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 1 0) z3(α) = α (1 3 1 3 1 3 ) + (1 −α) (0 0 1) and obtain D(x,t) = z(αt) ∗xvia a schedule deﬁned as α1,...,α t for each respective step. Notice that a gray image is obtained when xT = z(1) ∗x0. We can tune the ratio αt to control the amount of information removed in each step. For our experiment, we schedule the ratio such that for every twe have xt = z(αt) ∗... ∗z(α1) ∗x0 = z( t T) ∗x0. This schedule ensures that color information lost between steps is smaller in earlier stage of the diffusion and becomes larger as tincreases. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 50 and for CelebA we use T = 20.

We illustrate our recolorization results in Figure 14. We present testing examples, as well as their grey scale images, from all the datasets, and compare the recolorization results with the original images. The recolored images feature correct color separation between different regions, and feature various and yet semantically correct colorization of objects. Our sampling technique still yields minor differences in comparison to the direct reconstruction, although the change is not visually apparent. We attribute this to the shape restriction of colorization task, as human perception is rather insensitive to minor color change. We also provide quantitative measurement for the effectiveness of our recolorization results in terms of different similarity metrics, and summarize the results in Table 6.

A.5 Image Snow Here we provide results for the additional task of snowiﬁcation, which is a direct adaptation of the ofﬁcal implementation of ImageNet-C snowiﬁcation process [Hendrycks and Dietterich, 2019]. To determine the snow pattern of a given image x0 ∈RC×H×W, we ﬁrst construct a seed matrix SA ∈RH×W where each entry is sampled from a Gaussian distribution N(µ,σ). The upper-left corner of SA is then zoomed into another matrix SB ∈RH×W with spline interpolation. Next, we create a new matrix SC by ﬁltering each value of SB with a given threshold c1 as SC[i][j] = {0, S B[i][j] ≤c1 SB[i][j], S B[i][j] >c1 and clip each entry of SC into the range [0,1]. We then convolve SC using a motion blur kernel with standard deviation c2 to create the snow pattern Sand its up-side-down rotation S′. The direction of the motional blur kernel is randomly chosen as either vertical or horizontal. The ﬁnal snow image is 16created by again clipping each value of x0 + S+ S′into the range [0,1]. For simplicity, we abstract the process as a function h(x0,SA,c0,c1). Degraded Direct Alg.

Left to right: degraded inputs D(x0,T) , direct reconstruction R(D(x0,T)), sampled reconstruction with Algorithm 2, and original image. To create a series ofT images with increasing snowiﬁcation, we linearly interpolatec0 and c1 between [cstart 0 ,cend 0 ] and [cstart 1 ,cend 1 ] respectively, to create c0(t) and c1(t), t= 1,...,T . Then for each x0, a seed matrix Sx is sampled, the motion blur direction is randomized, and we construct each related xt by xt = h(x0,Sx,c0(t),c1(t)). Visually, c0(t) dictates the severity of the snow, while c1(t) determines how “windy\" the snowiﬁed image seems. For both CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A, we use the same Gaussian distribution with parameters µ= 0.55 and σ = 0 .3 to generate the seed matrix. For CIFAR-10, we choose cstart 0 = 1 .15, cend 0 = 0 .7, cstart 1 = 0 .05 and cend 1 = 16 , which generates a visually lighter snow. For Celeb-A, we choose cstart 0 = 1.15, cend 0 = 0.55, cstart 1 = 0.05 and cend 1 = 20, which generates a visually heavier snow. We train the models on different datasets for 700,000 gradient steps. We use Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] optimizer with learning rate 2 ×10−5. We use batch size 32, and we accumulate the gradients every 2 steps. Our ﬁnal model is an exponential moving average of the trained model with decay rate 0.995. We update the EMA model every 10 gradient steps. For CIFAR-10 we use T = 200 and for CelebA we use T = 200. We note that the seed matrix is resampled for each individual training batch, and hence the snow pattern varies across the training stage. A.6 Generation using noise : Further Details Here we will discuss in further detail on the similarity between the sampling method proposed in Algorithm 2 and the deterministic sampling in DDIM [Song et al., 2021a]. Given the image xt at step t, we have the restored clean image ˆx0 from the diffusion model. Hence given the estimated ˆx0 and xt, we can estimate the noise z(xt,t) (or ˆz) as z(xt,t) = xt −√αt ˆx0√1 −αt , Thus, the D( ˆx0,t) and D( ˆx0,t −1) can be written as D( ˆx0,t) = √αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz, D( ˆx0,t −1) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz, using which the sampling process in Algorithm 2 to estimate xt−1 can be written as, 17xt−1 = xt −D( ˆx0,t) + D( ˆx0,t −1) = xt −(√αt ˆx0 + √ 1 −αtˆz) + (√αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz) = √αt−1 ˆx0 + √ 1 −αt−1 ˆz (3) which is same as the sampling method as described in [Song et al., 2021a]. A.7 Generation using blur transformation: Further Details Figure 16: Examples of generated samples from 128×128 CelebA and AFHQ datasets using Method 2 with perfect symmetry. The Figure 16, shows the generation without breaking any symmetry within each channel are quite promising as well. Necessity of Algorithm 2: In the case of unconditional generation, we observe a marked superiority in quality of the sampled reconstruction using Algorithm 2 over any other method considered. For example, in the broken symmetry case, the FID of the directly reconstructed images is 257.69 for CelebA and 214.24 for AFHQ, which are far worse than the scores of 49.45 and 54.68 from Table 5. In Figure 17, we also give a qualitative comparison of this difference. We can also clearly see from Figure 18 that Algorithm 1, the method used in Song et al. [2021b] and Ho et al. [2020], completely fails to produce an image close to the target data distribution. 18Figure 17: Comparison of direct reconstruction with sampling using Algorithm 2 for generation with Method 2 and broken symmetry.

Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models. 1 Introduction In recent years, diffusion models [1–4] have become one of the leading generative models, powering the state-of-the-art image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion [5]. To understand the empirical success of diffusion models, several works [6–12] have focused on their sampling behavior, showing that the data distribution can be effectively estimated in the reverse sampling process, assuming that the score function is learned accurately. Meanwhile, other works [ 13–18] investigate the learning of score functions, showing that effective approximation can be achieved with score matching loss under certain assumptions. However, these theoretical insights, grounded in simplified assumptions about data distribution and neural network architectures, do not fully capture the complex dynamics of diffusion models in practical scenarios. One significant discrepancy between theory and practice is that real-world diffusion models are trained only on a finite number of data points. As argued in [19], theoretically a perfectly learned score function over the empirical data distribution can only replicate the training data. In contrast, diffusion models trained on finite samples exhibit remarkable generalizability, producing high-quality images that significantly differ from the training examples. Therefore, a good understanding of the remarkable generative power of diffusion models is still lacking. In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of generalizability in diffusion models by analyzing the inherent properties of the learned score functions. Essentially, the score functions can be interpreted as a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. These denoisers are then 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2410.24060v5  [cs.LG]  2 Dec 2024chained together to progressively denoise a randomly sampled Gaussian noise into its corresponding clean image, thus, understanding the function mappings of these diffusion denoisers is critical to demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Motivated by the linearity observed in the diffusion denoisers of effectively generalized diffusion models, we propose to elucidate their function mappings with a linear distillation approach, where the resulting linear models serve as the linear approximations of their nonlinear counterparts. Contributions of this work: Our key findings can be highlighted as follows: • Inductive bias towards Gaussian structures (Section 3). Diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close (but not equal) to the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, defined by the empirical mean and covariance of the training data. This implies the diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training data for image generation. • Model Capacity and Training Duration (Section 4) We show that this inductive bias is most pronounced when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of the training data. However, even if the model is highly overparameterized, such inductive bias still emerges during early training phases, before the model memorizes its training data. This implies that early stopping can prompt generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. • Connection between Strong Generalization and Gaussian Structure (Section 5). Lastly, we argue that the recently observed strong generalization [20] results from diffusion models learning certain common low-dimensional structural features shared across non-overlapping datasets. We show that such low-dimensional features can be partially explained through the Gaussian structure. Relationship with Prior Arts. Recent research [20–24] demonstrates that diffusion models operate in two distinct regimes: ( i) a memorization regime, where models primarily reproduce training samples and (ii) a generalization regime, where models generate high-quality, novel images that extend beyond the training data. In the generalization regime, a particularly intriguing phenomenon is that diffusion models trained on non-overlapping datasets can generate nearly identical samples [20]. While prior work [20] attributes this ”strong generalization” effect to the structural inductive bias inherent in diffusion models leading to the optimal denoising basis (geometry-adaptive harmonic basis), our research advances this understanding by demonstrating diffusion models’ inductive bias towards capturing the Gaussian structure of the training data. Our findings also corroborate with observations of earlier study [25] that the learned score functions of well-trained diffusion models closely align with the optimal score functions of a multivariate Gaussian approximation of the training data. 2 Preliminary Basics of Diffusion Models. Given a data distribution pdata(x), where x ∈ Rd, diffusion mod- els [1–4] define a series of intermediate states p(x; σ(t)) by adding Gaussian noise sampled from N(0, σ(t)2I) to the data, where σ(t) is a predefined schedule that specifies the noise level at time t ∈ [0, T], such that at the end stage the noise mollified distribution p(x; σ(T)) is indistinguishable from the pure Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, a new sample is generated by progressively denoising a random noise xT ∼ N(0, σ(T)2I) to its corresponding clean image x0. Following [4], this forward and backward diffusion process can be expressed with a probabilistic ODE: dx = −˙σ(t)σ(t)∇x log p(x; σ(t))dt. (1) In practice the score function ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) can be approximated by ∇x log p(x; σ(t)) = (Dθ(x; σ(t)) − x)/σ(t)2, (2) where Dθ(x; σ(t)) is parameterized by a deep network with parameters θ trained with the denoising score matching objective: min θ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I) \u0002 ∥Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − x∥2 2 \u0003 . (3) In the discrete setting, the reverse ODE in (1) takes the following form: xi+1 ← (1 − (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti))xi + (ti − ti+1) ˙σ(ti) σ(ti)Dθ(xi; σ(ti)), (4) 2where x0 ∼ N(0, σ2(t0)I). Notice that at each iteration i, the intermediate sample xi+1 is the sum of the scaled xi and the denoising output Dθ(xi; σ(ti)). Obviously, the final sampled image is largely determined by the denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)). If we can understand the function mapping of these diffusion denoisers, we can demystify the working mechanism of diffusion models. Optimal Diffusion Denoisers under Simplified Data Assumptions. Under certain assumptions on the data distribution pdata(x), the optimal diffusion denoisers Dθ(x; σ(t)) that minimize the score matching objective (3) can be derived analytically in closed-forms as we discuss below. • Multi-delta distribution of the training data. Suppose the training dataset contains a finite number of data points {y1, y2, ...,yN }, a natural way to model the data distribution is to represent it as a multi-delta distribution: p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi). In this case, the optimal denoiser is DM(x; σ(t)) = PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I)yi PN i=1 N(x; yi, σ(t)2I) , (5) which is essentially a softmax-weighted combination of the finite data points. As proved in [24], such diffusion denoisers DM(x; σ(t)) can only generate exact replicas of the training samples, therefore they have no generalizability. • Multivariate Gaussian distribution. Recent work [ 25] suggests modeling the data distribution pdata(x) as a multivariate Gaussian distribution p(x) = N(µ, Σ), where the mean µ and the co- variance Σ are approximated by the empirical mean µ = 1 N PN i=1 yi and the empirical covariance Σ = 1 N PN i=1(yi − µ)(yi − µ)T of the training dataset. In this case, the optimal denoiser is: DG(x; σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), (6) where Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values Λ = diag (λ1, ··· , λd) and ˜Λσ(t) = diag \u0010 λ1 λ1+σ(t)2 , ··· , λd λd+σ(t)2 \u0011 . With this linear Gaus- sian denoiser, as proved in [25], the sampling trajectory of the probabilistic ODE (1) has close form: xt = µ + dX i=1 s σ(t)2 + λi σ(T)2 + λi uT i (xT − µ)ui, (7) where ui is the ith singular vector of the empirical covariance matrix. While [ 25] demonstrate that the Gaussian scores approximate learned scores at high noise variances, we show that they are nearly the best linear approximations of learned scores across a much wider range of noise variances. Generalization vs. Memorization of Diffusion Models. As the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images [17]. While memorization can be interpreted as an overfitting of diffusion models to the training samples, the mechanisms underlying the generalization regime remain less well understood. This study aims to explore and elucidate the inductive bias that enables effective generalization in diffusion models. 3 Hidden Linear and Gaussian Structures in Diffusion Models In this section, we study the intrinsic structures of the learned score functions of diffusion models in the generalization regime. Through various experiments and theoretical investigation, we show that Diffusion models in the generalization regime have inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structures of the dataset. Based on the linearity observed in diffusion denoisers trained in the generalization regime, we propose to investigate their intrinsic properties through a linear distillation technique, with which we train a series of linear models to approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers (Section 3.1). Interestingly, these linear models closely resemble the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset (Section 3.2). This implies diffusion models have the inductive bias towards learning the Gaussian structure of the 3training dataset. We theoretically show that the observed Gaussian structure is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the constraint that the model is linear (Section 3.3). In the subsequent sections, although we mainly demonstrate our results using the FFHQ datasets, our findings are robust and extend to various architectures and datasets, as detailed in Appendix G. 3.1 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime Our study is motivated by the emerging linearity observed in diffusion models in the generalization regime. Specifically, we quantify the linearity of diffusion denoisers at various noise levelσ(t) by jointly assessing their ”Additivity” and ”Homogeneity” with a linearity score (LS) defined by the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)): LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x2; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , where x1, x2 ∼ p(x; σ(t)), and α ∈ R and β ∈ R are scalars. In practice, the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 samples. A more detailed discussion on this choice of measuring linearity is deferred to Appendix A. Figure 1: Linearity scores of diffusion denoisers. Solid and dashed lines depict the linearity scores across noise variances for models in the general- ization and memorization regimes, respectively, where α = β = 1/ √ 2. Following the EDM training configuration [4], we set the noise levels σ(t) within the contin- uous range [0.002,80]. As shown in Figure 1, as diffusion models transition from the mem- orization regime to the generalization regime (increasing the training dataset size), the corre- sponding diffusion denoisers Dθ exhibit increas- ing linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets1 as well as various training con- figurations2; see Appendix B for more details. This emerging linearity motivates us to ask the following questions: • To what extent can a diffusion model be ap- proximated by a linear model? • If diffusion models can be approximated lin- early, what are the underlying characteristics of this linear approximation? Investigating the Linear Structures via Linear Distillation. To address these questions, we investigate the hidden linear structure of diffusion denoisers through linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiserDθ(x; σ(t)) at noise levelσ(t), we approximate it with a linear function (with a bias term) such that: DL(x; σ(t)) := Wσ(t)x + bσ(t) ≈ Dθ(x; σ(t)), ∀x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), (8) where the weight Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d and bias bσ(t) ∈ Rd are learned by solving the following optimiza- tion problem with gradient descent:3 min Wσ(t),bσ(t) Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||Wσ(t)(x + ϵ) + bσ(t) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))||2 2. (9) If these linear models effectively approximate the nonlinear diffusion denoisers, analyzing their weights can elucidate the generation mechanism. While diffusion models are trained on continuous noise variance levels within [0.002,80], we examine the 10 discrete sampling steps specified by the EDM schedule [4]: [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002] . These steps are considered sufficient for studying the diffusion mappings for two reasons: (i) images generated using these 10 steps closely match those generated 1For example, FFHQ [26], CIFAR-10 [27], AFHQ [28] and LSUN-Churches [29]. 2For example, EDM-VE, EDM-VP and EDM-ADM. 3For the following, the input is the vectorized version of the noisy image and the expectation is approximated using finite samples of input-output pairs (xi + ϵi, Dθ(xi + ϵ, σ(t))) with i = 1, ..., N(see distillation details in Appendix C). 4Generation Trajectories  (                     )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) Figure 2: Score field approximation error and sampling Trajectory. The left and right figures demonstrate the score field approximation error and the sampling trajectories D(xt; σ(t) of actual diffusion model (EDM), Multi-Delta model, linear model and Gaussian model respectively. Notice that the curve corresponding to the Gaussian model almost overlaps with that of the linear model, suggesting they share similar funciton mappings. with more steps, and (ii) recent research [30] demonstrates that the diffusion denoisers trained on similar noise variances exhibit analogous function mappings, implying that denoiser behavior at discrete variances represents their behavior at nearby variances. After obtaining the linear modelsDL, we evaluate their differences with the actual nonlinear denoisers Dθ with the score field approximation error, calculated using the expectation over the root mean square error (RMSE): Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) r ∥DL(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t))∥2 2 d| {z } RMSE of a pair of randomly sampled x and ϵ , (10) where d represents the data dimension and the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean. While we present RMSE-based results in the main text, our findings remain consistent across alternative metrics, including NMSE, as detailed in Appendix G. We perform linear distillation on well trained diffusion models operating in the generalization regime. For comprehensive analysis, we also compute the score approximation error between Dθ and: (i) the optimal denoisers for the multi-delta distribution DM defined as (5), and (ii) the optimal denoisers for the multivariate Gaussian distribution DG defined as (6). As shown in Figure 2, our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [20,80]. In this regime, only coarse image structures are generated (Fig- ure 2(right)). Quantitatively, as shown in Figure 2(left), the distilled linear model DL closely approximates its nonlinear counterpart Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. Both Gaussian score DG and multi-delta score DM also achieve comparable approximation accuracy. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, only subtle, imperceptible details are added to the generated images. Here, both DL and DG effectively approximate Dθ with RMSE below 0.05. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,20]: This crucial regime, where realistic image content is primarily generated, exhibits significant nonlinearity. While DM exhibits high approximation error due to rapid convergence to training samples—a memorization effect theoretically proved in [24], both DL and DG maintain relatively lower approximation errors. Qualitatively, as shown in Figure 2(right), despite the relatively high score approximation error in the intermediate noise regime, the images generated with DL closely resemble those generated with Dθ in terms of the overall image structure and certain amount of fine details. This implies (i) the underlying linear structure within the nonlinear diffusion models plays a pivotal role in their generalization capabilities and (ii) such linear structure is effectively captured by our distilled linear models. In the next section, we will explore this linear structure by examining the linear models DL. 3.2 Inductive Bias towards Learning the Gaussian Structures Notably, the Gaussian denoisers DG exhibit behavior strikingly similar to the linear denoisers DL. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), they achieve nearly identical score approximation errors, particularly 5Correlation Matrices !0123456 ! ‖\"!(#)−$\t&'!#$2‖&/‖$7Λ!#$2‖& Figure 4: Linear model shares similar function mapping with Gaussian model.

The right figure shows the correlation matrices between the first 100 singular vectors of the linear weights and Gaussian weights. in the critical intermediate variance region. Furthermore, their sampling trajectories are remarkably similar (Figure 2(right)), producing nearly identical generated images that closely match those from the actual diffusion denoisers (Figure 3). These observations suggest that DL and DG share similar function mappings across various noise levels, leading us to hypothesize that the intrinsic linear structure underlying diffusion models corresponds to the Gaussian structure of the training data—specifically, its empirical mean and covariance. We validate this hypothesis by empirically showing that DL is close to DG through the following three complementary experiments: • Similarity in weight matrices. As illustrated in Figure 4(left), Wσ(t) progressively converge towards U ˜Λσ(t)UT throughout the linear distillation process, achieving small normalized MSE (less than 0.2) for most of the noise levels. The less satisfactory convergence behavior at σ(t) = 80.0 is due to inadequate training of the diffusion models at this particular noise level, which is minimally sampled during the training of actual diffusion models (see Appendix G.2 for more details). Figure 3: Images sampled from vari- ous Models. The figure shows the sam- ples generated using different models starting from the same initial noises. • Similarity in Score functions. Furthermore, Figure 2(left, gray line) demonstrates that DL and DG maintain small score differences (RMSE less than 0.05) across all noise levels, indicating that these denoisers exhibit similar func- tion mappings throughout the diffusion process. • Similarity in principal components. As shown in Fig- ure 4(right), for a wide noise range (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0]), the leading singular vectors of the linear weights Wσ(t) (denoted ULinear) align well withU, the singular vectors of the Gaussian weights.4 This implies that U, representing the principal components of the training data, is effectively captured by the diffusion models. In the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]), however, Dθ approximates the identity mapping, leading to ambiguous singular vectors with minimal impact on image generation. Further analy- sis of Dθ’s behavior in the low-noise regime is provided in Appendices D and F.1. Since the optimization problem (9) is convex w.r.t. Wσ(t) and bσ(t), the optimal solution DL represents the unique optimal linear approximation of Dθ. Our analyses demonstrate that this optimal linear approximation closely aligns with DG, leading to our central finding: diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias (which we term as the Gaussian inductive bias) towards learning the Gaussian structure of training data. This manifests in two main ways: ( i) In the high-noise variance regime, well-trained diffusion models learn Dθ that closely approximate the linear Gaussian denoisers DG; (ii) As noise variance decreases, although Dθ diverges from DG, DG remains nearly identical to the optimal linear approximation DL, and images generated by DG retain structural similarity to those generated by Dθ. Finally, we emphasize that the Gaussian inductive bias only emerges in the generalization regime. By contrast, in the memorization regime, Figure 5 shows that DL significantly diverges from DG, and 4For σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 80.0], the less well recovered singular vectors have singular values close to 0, whereas those corresponding to high singular values are well recovered. 6Clean Image!Noise\"∼.(/,&'#1)#=!+\" )!(\";&(')) )\"(\";&('))(70000))\"(\";&('))(35000))\"(\";&('))(1094))\"(\";&('))(68) )!(#;&(')) )\"(#;&('))(70000))\"(#;&('))(35000))\"(#;&('))(1094))\"(#;&('))(68) Denoising Outputs  for !\"=4 MemorizationGeneralization(a) (b) Figure 5: Comparison between the diffusion denoisers in memorization and generalization regimes. Figure(a) demonstrates that in the memorization regime (trained on small datasets of size 1094 and 68), DL significantly diverges from DG, and both provide substantially poorer approxima- tions of Dθ compared to the generalization regime (trained on larger datasets of size 35000 and 1094). Figure(b) qualitatively shows that the denoising outputs of Dθ closely match those of DG only in the generalization regime—a similarity that persists even when the denoisers process pure noise inputs. both DG and DL provide considerably poorer approximations of Dθ compared to the generalization regime. 3.3 Theoretical Analysis In this section, we demonstrate that imposing linear constraints on diffusion models while minimizing the denoising score matching objective (3) leads to the emergence of Gaussian structure. Theorem 1. Consider a diffusion denoiser parameterized as a single-layer linear network, defined as D(xt; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)xt + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is a linear weight matrix and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias vector. When the data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ, the optimal solution to the score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser defined in (6): DG(xt; σ(t)) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT (xt − µ) + µ, with Wσ(t) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT and bσ(t) = \u0010 I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT \u0011 µ. The detailed proof is postponed to Appendix E. This optimal solution corresponds to the classical Wiener filter [ 31], revealing that diffusion models naturally learn the Gaussian denoisers when constrained to linear architectures. To understand why highly nonlinear diffusion models operate near this linear regime, it is helpful to model the training data distribution as the multi-delta distribution p(x) = 1 N PN i=1 δ(x − yi), where {y1, y2, ...,yN } is the finite training images. Notice that this formulation better reflects practical scenarios where only a finite number of training samples are available rather than the ground truth data distribution. Importantly, it is proved in [ 25] that the optimal denoisers DM in this case is approximately equivalent to DG for high noise variance σ(t) and query points far from the finite training data. This equivalence explains the strong similarity between DG and DM in the high-noise variance regime, and consequently, why Dθ and DG exhibit high similarity in this regime—deep networks converge to the optimal denoisers for finite training datasets. However, this equivalence betweenDG and DM breaks down at lower σ(t) values. The denoising outputs of DM are convex combinations of training data points, weighted by a softmax function with temperature σ(t)2. As σ(t)2 decreases, this softmax function increasingly approximates an argmax function, effectively retrieving the training point yi closest to the input x. Learning this optimal solution requires not only sufficient model capacity to memorize the entire training dataset but also, as shown in [32], an exponentially large number of training samples. Due to these learning challenges, deep networks instead converge to local minimaDθ that, while differing fromDM, exhibit better generalization property. Our experiments reveal that these learned Dθ share similar function mappings with DG. The precise mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question for future research. 7MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 6: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structure when training dataset is large. Models with a fixed scale (channel size 128) are trained across various dataset sizes. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. ”NN” denotes the nearest neighbor in the training dataset to the images generated by the diffusion models. Notably, modeling pdata(x) as a multi-delta distribution reveals a key insight: while unconstrained optimal denoisers (5) perfectly capture the scores of the empirical distribution, they have no gen- eralizability. In contrast, Gaussian denoisers, despite having higher score approximation errors due to the linear constraint, can generate novel images that closely match those produced by the actual diffusion models. This suggests that the generative power of diffusion models stems from the imperfect learning of the score functions of the empirical distribution. 4 Conditions for the Emergence of Gaussian Structures and Generalizability In Section 3, we demonstrate that diffusion models exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers that are close to the Gaussian denoisers. In this section, we investigate the conditions under which this bias manifests. Our findings reveal that this inductive bias is linked to model generalization and is governed by (i) the model capacity relative to the dataset size and (ii) the training duration. For additional results, including experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, see Appendix F. 4.1 Gaussian Structures Emerge when Model Capacity is Relatively Small First, we find that the Gaussian inductive bias and the generalization of diffusion models are heavily influenced by the relative size of the model capacity compared to the training dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures when the model capacity is relatively small compared to the size of training dataset. This argument is supported by the following two key observations: • Increasing dataset size prompts the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed model scale. We train diffusion models using the EDM configuration [4] with a fixed channel size of 128 on datasets of varying sizes [68, 137, 1094, 8750, 35000, 70000] until FID convergence. Figure 6(left) demonstrates that the score approximation error between diffusion denoisers Dθ and Gaussian denoisers DG decreases as the training dataset size grows, particularly in the crucial intermediate noise variance regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]). This increasing similarity between Dθ and DG correlates with a transition in the models’ behavior: from a memorization regime, where generated images are replicas of training samples, to a generalization regime, where novel images exhibiting Gaussian structure5 are produced, as shown in Figure 6(b). This correlation underscores the critical role of Gaussian structure in the generalization capabilities of diffusion models. • Decreasing model capacity promotes the emergence of Gaussian structure at fixed dataset sizes. Next, we investigate the impact of model scale by training diffusion models with varying channel sizes [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], corresponding to[64k, 251k, 992k, 4M, 16M, 64M] parameters, on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. Figure 7(left) shows that in the intermediate noise variance regime 5We use the term ”exhibiting Gaussian structure” to describe images that resemble those generated by Gaussian denoisers. 8GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 7: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure when model scale is small. Models with different scales are trained on a fixed training dataset of 1094 images. The left and right figures show the score difference and the generated images respectively. GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 8: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs. Diffusion model with same scale (channel size 128) is trained using 1094 images. The left and right figures shows the score difference and the generated images respectively. (σ(t) ∈ [0.116, 20]), the discrepancy between Dθ and DG decreases with decreasing model scale, indicating that Gaussian structure emerges in low-capacity models. Figure 7(right) demonstrates that this trend corresponds to a transition from data memorization to the generation of images exhibiting Gaussian structure. Here we note that smaller models lead to larger discrepancy between Dθ and DG in the high-noise regime. This phenomenon arises because diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances, especially when model capacity is limited (see more details in Appendix F.2). These two experiments collectively suggest that the inductive bias of diffusion models is governed by the relative capacity of the model compared to the training dataset size. 4.2 Overparameterized Models Learn Gaussian Structures before Memorization In the overparameterized regime, where model capacity significantly exceeds training dataset size, diffusion models eventually memorize the training data when trained to convergence. However, examining the learning progression reveals a key insight: Diffusion models learn the Gaussian structures with generalizability before they memorize. Figure 8(a) demonstrates that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ progressively converge to DG in the intermediate noise variance regime, indicating that the diffusion model is progressively learning the Gaussian structure in the initial stages of training. Notably. By epoch 841, the diffusion model generates images strongly resembling those produced by the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 8(b). However, continued training beyond this point increases the difference between Dθ and DG as the model transitions toward memorization. This observation suggests that early stopping could be an effective strategy for promoting generalization in overparameterized diffusion models. 9Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 35000, model scale 128 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 35000) Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 1094) Non-overlapping datasets with size 1094, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 8 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (1094) Figure 9: Diffusion models in the strong generalization regime generate similar images as the Gaussian models.

Figure(b) Top: Generated images of Gausisan model; Bottom: Generated images of diffusion models in the memorization regime, with model scale 128; S1 and S2 each has 1094 non-overlapping images. Figure(c): Early stopping and reducing model capacity help transition diffusion models from memorization to generalization. 5 Connection between Strong Generalizability and Gaussian Structure A recent study [ 20] reveals an intriguing ”strong generalization” phenomenon: diffusion models trained on large, non-overlapping image datasets generate nearly identical images from the same initial noise. While this phenomenon might be attributed to deep networks’ inductive bias towards learning the ”true” continuous distribution of photographic images, we propose an alternative explanation: rather than learning the complete distribution, deep networks may capture certain low-dimensional common structural features shared across these datasets and these features can be partially explained by the Gaussian structure. To validate this hypothesis, we examine two diffusion models with channel size 128, trained on non-overlapping datasets S1 and S2 (35000 images each). Figure 9(a) shows that images generated by these models (bottom) closely match those from their corresponding Gaussian models (top), highlighting the Gaussian structure’s role in strong generalization. Comparing Figure 9(a)(top) and (b)(top), we observe that DG generates nearly identical images whether the Gaussian structure is calculated on a small dataset (1094 images) or a much larger one (35000 images). This similarity emerges because datasets of the same class can exhibit similar Gaussian structure (empirical covariance) with relatively few samples—just hundreds for FFHQ. Given the Gaussian structure’s critical role in generalization, small datasets may already contain much of the information needed for generalization, contrasting previous assertions in [20] that strong generalization requires training on datasets of substantial size (more than 105 images). However, smaller datasets increase memorization risk, as shown in Figure 9(b). To mitigate this, as discussed in Section 4, we can either reduce model capacity or implement early stopping (Figure 9(c)). Indeed, models trained on 1094 and 35000 images generate remarkably similar images, though the smaller dataset yields lower perceptual quality. This similarity further demonstrates that small datasets contain substantial generalization-relevant information closely tied to Gaussian structure. Further discussion on the connections and differences between our work and [20] are detailed in Appendix H. 6 Discussion In this study, we empirically demonstrate that diffusion models in the generalization regime have the inductive bias towards learning diffusion denoisers that are close to the corresponding linear Gaussian denoisers. Although real-world image distributions are significantly different from Gaussian, our findings imply that diffusion models have the bias towards learning and utilizing low-dimensional data structures, such as the data covariance, for image generation. However, the underlying mechanism by which the nonlinear diffusion models, trained with gradient descent, exhibit such linearity remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Moreover, the Gaussian structure only partially explains diffusion models’ generalizability. While models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, a substan- tial gap persists between the linear Gaussian denoisers and the actual nonlinear diffusion models, especially in the intermediate noise regime. As a result, images generated by Gaussian denoisers fall 10short in perceptual quality compared to those generated by the actual diffusion models especially for complex dataset such as CIFAR-10. This disparity highlights the critical role of nonlinearity in high-quality image generation, a topic we aim to investigate further in future research.

For a diffusion denoiser, Dθ(x; σ(t)), to be considered approximately linear, it must fulfill the following conditions: • Additivity: The function should satisfy Dθ(x1 + x2; σ(t)) ≈ Dθ(x1; σ(t)) + Dθ(x2; σ(t)). • Homogeneity: It should also adhere to Dθ(αx; σ(t)) ≈ αDθ(x; σ(t)). To jointly assess these properties, we propose to measure the difference betweenDθ(αx1+βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)). While the linearity score is introduced as the cosine similarity between Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) and αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βD(x2; σ(t)) in the main text: LS(t) = Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) \u0014\f\f\f\f \u001c Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) ∥Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))∥2 , αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)) ∥αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t))∥2 \u001d\f\f\f\f \u0015 , (11) it can also be defined with the normalized mean square difference (NMSE): Ex1,x2∼p(x;σ(t)) ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t)) − (αDθ(x1; σ(t)) + βDθ(x1; σ(t)))||2 ||Dθ(αx1 + βx2; σ(t))||2 , (12) where the expectation is approximated with its empirical mean over 100 randomly sampled pairs of (x1, x2). In the next section, we will demonstrate the linearity score with both metrics. Since the diffusion denoisers are trained solely on inputs x ∼ p(x; σ(t)), their behaviors on out- of-distribution inputs can be quite irregular. To produce a denoised output with meaningful image structure, it is critical that the noise component in the input x matches the correct variance σ(t)2. Therefore, our analysis of linearity is restricted to in-distribution inputs x1 and x2, which are randomly sampled images with additive Gaussian noises calibrated to noise variance σ(t)2. We also need to ensure that the values of α and β are chosen such that α2 + β2 = 1, maintaining the correct variance for the noise term in the combined input αx1 + βx2. We present the linearity scores, calculated with varying values of α and β, for diffusion models trained on diverse datasets in Figure 10. These models are trained with the EDM-VE configuration proposed in [4], which ensures the resulting models are in the generalization regime. Typically, setting α = β = 1/ √ 2 yields the lowest linearity score; however, even in this scenario, the cosine similarity remains impressively high, exceeding 0.96. This high value underscores the presence of significant linearity within diffusion denoisers. We would like to emphasize that for linearity to manifest in diffusion denoisers, it is crucial that they are well-trained, achieving a low denoising score matching loss as indicated in (3). As shown in Figure 11, the linearity notably reduces in a less well trained diffusion model (Baseline-VE) comapred to its well-trained counterpart (EDM-VE). Although both models utilize the same ’VE’ network architecture Fθ(x; σ(t)) [2], they differ in how the diffusion denoisers are parameterized: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), (13) 15where cskip is the skip connection and cout modulate the scale of the network output. With carefully tailored cskip and cout, the EDM-VE configuration achieves a lower score matching loss compared to Baseline-VE, resulting in samples with higher quality as illustrated in Figure 11(right). B Emerging Linearity of Diffusion Models In this section we provide a detailed discussion on the observation that diffusion models exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization, which is briefly described in Section 3.1. B.1 Generalization and Memorization Regimes of Diffusion Models As shown in Figure 12, as the training dataset size increases, diffusion models transition from the memorization regime—where they can only replicate its training images—to the generalization regime, where the they produce high-quality, novel images. To measure the generalization capabilities of diffusion models, it is crucial to assess their ability to generate images that are not mere replications of the training dataset. This can be quantitatively evaluated by generating a large set of images from the diffusion model and measuring the average difference between these generated images and their nearest neighbors in the training set. Specifically, let {x1, x2, ...,xk} represent k randomly sampled images from the diffusion models (we choose k = 100 in our experiments), and let Y := {y1, y2, ...,yN } denote the training dataset consisting of N images. We define the generalization score as follows: GL Score := 1 k kX i=1 ||xi − NNY (xi)||2 ||xi||2 (14) where NNY (xi) represents the nearest neighbor of the samplexk in the training datasetY , determined by the Euclidean distance on a per-pixel basis. Empirically, a GL score exceeding 0.6 indicates that the diffusion models are effectively generalizing beyond the training dataset. B.2 Diffusion Models Exhibit Linearity in the Generalization Regime As demonstrated in Figure 13(a) and (d), diffusion models transition from the memorization regime to the generalization regime as the training dataset size increases. Concurrently, as depicted in Fig- ure 13(b), (c), (e) and (f), the corresponding diffusion denoisers exhibit increasingly linearity. This phenomenon persists across diverse datasets datasets including FFHQ [26], AFHQ [28] and LSUN- Churches [29], as well as various model architectures including EDM-VE [ 3], EDM-VP [2] and EDM-ADM [34]. This emerging linearity implies that the hidden linear structure plays an important role in the generalizability of diffusion model. C Linear Distillation As discussed in Section 3.1, we propose to study the hidden linearity observed in diffusion denosiers with linear distillation. Specifically, for a given diffusion denoiser Dθ(x; σ(t)), we aim to approxi- Figure 10: Linearity scores for varying α and β.

Notice that for three dimensional images with size (c, h, w), x ∈ Rd represents their vectorized version, where d = c × w × h.

Addi- tionally, we employ the Adam optimizer [35] for updates. Additional linear distillation results are provided in Figure 14. 17FFHQ CIFAR-10(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 13: Diffusion model exhibit increasing linearity as they transition from memorization to generalization. Figure(a) and (d) demonstrate that for both FFHQ and CIFAR-10 datasets, the generalization score increases with the training dataset size, indicating progressive model generaliza- tion. Figure(b), (c), (e), and (f) show that this transition towards generalization is accompanied by increasing denoiser linearity. Specifically, Figure(b) and (e) display linearity scores calculated using cosine similarity (11), while Figure(c) and (f) show scores computed using NMSE (12). Both metrics reveal consistent trends. D Diffusion Models in Low-noise Regime are Approximately Linear Mapping It should be noted that the low score difference between DG and Dθ within the low-noise regime (σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116]) does not imply the diffusion denoisers capture the Gaussian structure, instead, the similarity arises since both of them are converging to the identity mapping as σ(t) decreases. As shown in Figure 15, within this regime, the differences between the noisy input x and their corresponding denoised outputs Dθ(x; σ(t)) quickly approach 0. This indicates that the learned denoisers Dθ progressively converge to the identity function. Additionally, from (6), it is evident that the difference between the Gaussian weights and the identity matrix diminishes as σ(t) decreases, which explains why DG can well approximate Dθ in the low noise variance regime. We hypothesize that Dθ learns the identity function because of the following two reasons: (i) within the low-noise regime, since the added noise is negligible compared to the clean image, the identity function already achieves a small denoising error, thus serving as a shortcut which is exploited by the deep network. (ii) As discussed in Appendix A, diffusion models are typically parameterized as follows: Dθ(x; σ(t)) := cskip(σ(t))x + cout(Fθ(x; σ(t))), where Fθ represents the deep network, and cskip(σ(t)) and cout(σ(t)) are adaptive parameters for the skip connection and output scaling, respectively, which adjust according to the noise variance levels. For canonical works on diffusion models [2–4, 34], as σ(t) approaches zero, cskip and cout converge to 1 and 0 respectively. Consequently, at low variance levels, the function forms of diffusion denoisers are approximatly identity mapping: Dθ(x; σ(t)) ≈ x. This convergence to identity mapping has several implications. First, the weights Wσ(t) of the distilled linear models DL approach the identity matrix at low variances, leading to ambiguous 18Algorithm 1 Linear Distillation Require: (i) the targeted diffusion denoiser Dθ(·; σ(t)), (ii) weights Wσ(t) and biases bσ(t), both initialized to zero, (iii) gradient step size η, (iv) number of training iterations K, (v) training batch size n, (vi) image dataset S. for k = 1 to K do Randomly sample a batch of training images {x1, x2, . . . ,xn} from S.

Figure(a) demonstrates the gradual symmetrization of linear weights during the distillation process. Figure(b) shows that at convergence, the singular values of the linear weights closely match those of the Gaussian weights. Figure(c) and Figure(d) display the leading singular vectors of both linear and Gaussian weights at σ(t) = 4 for FFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets, respectively, revealing a strong correlation. singular vectors. This explains the poor recovery of singular vectors for σ(t) ∈ [0.002, 0.116] shown in Figure 4. Second, the presence of the bias term in (8) makes it challenging for our linear model to learn the identity function, resulting in large errors at σ(t) = 0.002 as shown in Figure 4(a). Finally, from (4), we observe that when Dθ acts as an identity mapping, xi+1 remains unchanged from xi. This implies that sampling steps in low-variance regions minimally affect the generated image content, as confirmed in Figure 2, where image content shows negligible variation during these steps. 19Normalized MSE between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙  Cosine Similarity between 𝑫𝜽𝒙;𝜎𝑡  and  𝒙   (b)(a)  (c) (d) Figure 15: Difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x for various noise variance levels.

Figures(b) and (d) provide zoomed-in views of (a) and (c). The diffusion models were trained on the FFHQ dataset. Notice that the difference between Dθ(x; σ(t)) and x quickly converges to near zero in the low noise variance regime. The trend is consistent for various model architectures. E Theoretical Analysis E.1 Proof of Theorem 1 In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1 (Section 3.3). Our theorem is based on the following two assumptions: Assumption 1. Suppose that the diffusion denoisers are parameterized as single-layer linear net- works, defined as D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), where Wσ(t) ∈ Rd×d is the linear weight and bσ(t) ∈ Rd is the bias. Assumption 2. The data distribution pdata(x) has finite mean µ and bounded positive semidefinite covariance Σ Theorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective (3) is exactly the Gaussian denoiser: DG(x, σ(t)) = µ + U ˜Λσ(t)UT (x − µ), where Σ = UΛUT represents the SVD of the covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,d} and ˜Λσ(t) = diag[ λk λk+σ(t)2 ]. Furthermore, this optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. To proveTheorem 1, we first show that the Gaussian denoiser is the optimal solution to the denoising score matching objective under the linear network constraint. Then we will show that such optimal solution can be obtained via gradient descent with a proper learning rate. The Global Optimal Solution. Under the constraint that the diffusion denoiser is restricted to a single-layer linear network with bias: D(x; σ(t)) = Wσ(t)x + bσ(t), (15) We get the following optimizaiton problem from Equation (3): W⋆, b⋆ = arg min W,b L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2, (16) where we omit the footnote σ(t) in Wσ(t) and bσ(t) for simplicity. Since expectation preserves convexity, the optimization problem Equation (16) is a convex optimization problem. To find the global optimum, we first eliminate b by requiring the partial derivative ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) to be 0. Since ∇bL(W, b; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)((W − I)x + Wϵ + b) (17) = 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata ((W − I)x + b) (18) = 2 ∗ ((W − I)µ + b), (19) we have b⋆ = (I − W∗)µ. (20) 20Utilizing the expression for b, we get the following equivalent form of the optimization problem: W⋆ = arg min W L(W; σ(t)) := 2 ∗ Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x − µ + ϵ) − (x − µ)||2 2. (21) The derivative ∇W L(W; σ(t)) is: ∇W L(W; σ(t)) = 2 ∗ ExEϵ(W(x − µ + ϵ)(x − µ + ϵ)T − (x − µ)(x − µ + ϵ)T ) (22) = 2 ∗ Ex((W − I)(x − µ)(x − µ)T + σ(t)2W) (23) = 2 ∗ W(Σ + σ(t)2I) − 2 ∗ Σ. (24) Suppose Σ = UΛUT is the SVD of the empirical covariance matrix, with singular values λ{k=1,...,n}, by setting ∇W L(W; σ(t)) to 0, we get the optimal solution: W⋆ = UΛUT U(Λ + σ(t)2I)−1UT (25) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT , (26) where ˜Λσ(t)[i, i] = λi λi+σ(t)2 and λi = Λ[i, i]. Substitute W⋆ back to Equation (20), we have: b⋆ = (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (27) Notice that the expression for W⋆ and b⋆ is exactly the Gaussian denoiser. Next, we will show this optimal solution can be achieved with gradient descent. Gradient Descent Recovers the Optimal Solution. Consider minimizing the population loss: L(W, b; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)||W(x + ϵ) + b − x||2 2. (28) Define ˜W := [W b ], ˜x := \u0014 x 1 \u0015 and ˜ϵ = \u0014 ϵ 0 \u0015 , then we can rewrite Equation (28) as: L( ˜W; σ(t)) := Ex∼pdata Eϵ∼N(0,σ(t)2I)|| ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ) − x||2 2. (29) We can compute the gradient in terms of ˜W as: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x + ˜ϵ)(˜x + ˜ϵ)T − x(˜x + ˜ϵ)T ) (30) = 2 ∗ Ex,ϵ( ˜W(˜x˜xT + ˜x˜ϵT + ˜ϵ˜xT + ˜ϵ˜ϵT ) − x˜xT − x˜ϵT ). (31) Since Eϵ(˜ϵ) = 0 and Eϵ(˜ϵ˜ϵT ) = \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ∗ Ex( ˜W(˜x˜xT + \u0014 σ(t)2Id×d 0d×1 01×d 0 \u0015 ) − x˜xT ). (32) Since E(˜x˜xT ) = \u0014 E(xxT ) E(x) E(xT ) 1 \u0015 , we have: ∇L( ˜W) = 2 ˜W \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 − 2 \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 . (33) With learning rate η, we can write the update rule as: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 ) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 (34) = ˜W(t)(1 − 2ηA) + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 , (35) where we define A := I − 2η \u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ µT 1 \u0015 for simplicity. By recursively expanding the expression for ˜W, we have: ˜W(t + 1) = ˜W(0)At+1 + 2η \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003 tX i=0 Ai. (36) 21Notice that there exists a η, such that every eigen value of A is smaller than 1 and greater than 0. In this case, At+1 → 0 as t → ∞. Similarly, by the property of matrix geometric series, we havePt i=0 Ai → (I − A)−1. Therefore we have: ˜W → \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I µ uT 1 \u0015−1 (37) = \u0002 Ex(xT x) µ \u0003\u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 , (38) where we define B := Ex(xxT ) + σ(t)2I for simplicity. By the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula, we have: \u0014 B µ µT 1 \u0015−1 = \u0014 (B − µµT )−1 −(B − µµT )−1µ −(1 − µT B−1µ)−1µT B−1 (1 − µT B−1µ)−1 \u0015 . (39) Therefore, we have: ˜W → h Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1−µT B−1µ −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1−µT B−1µ i , (40) from which we have W → Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ (41) b → −Ex[xxT ](B − µµT )−1µ + µ 1 − µT B−1µ (42) Since Ex[xxT ] = Ex[(x − µ)((x − µ)T ] + µµT , we have: W = Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 + µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ. (43) Applying Sherman-Morrison Formula, we have: (B − µµT )−1 = B−1 + B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ , (44) therefore µµT (B − µµT )−1 − µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ = µµT B−1µµT B−1 1 − µT B−1µ − µµT B−1µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ (45) = µT B−1µ 1 − µT B−1µ(µµT B−1 − µµT B−1) (46) = 0 (47) , which implies W → Σ(Σ + σ(t)2I)−1 (48) = U ˜Λσ(t)UT . (49) Similarly, we have: b → (I − U ˜Λσ(t)UT )µ. (50) Therefore, gradient descent with a properly chosen learning rate η recovers the Gaussian Denoisers when time goes to infinity. E.2 Two Extreme Cases Our empirical results indicate that the best linear approximation of Dθ is approximately equivalent to DG. According to the orthogonality principle [36], this requires Dθ to satisfy: Ex∼pdata(x)Eϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I){(Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) − (x − µ))(x + ϵ − µ)T } ≈0. (51) Notice that (51) does not hold for general denoisers. Two extreme cases for this to hold are: 22• Case 1: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ x for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). • Case 2: Dθ(x + ϵ; σ(t)) ≈ DG(x + ϵ; σ(t)) for ∀x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I). Case 1 requires Dθ(x+ϵ; σ(t)) to be the oracle denoiser that perfectly recover the ground truth clean image, which never happens in practice except when σ(t) becomes extremely small. Instead, our empirical results suggest diffusion models in the generalization regime bias towards Case 2, where deep networks learn Dθ that approximate (not equal) to DG. This is evidenced in Figure 5(b), where diffusion models trained on larger datasets (35000 and 7000 images) produce denoising outputs similar to DG. Notice that this similarity holds even when the denoisers take pure Gaussian noise as input. The exact mechanism driving diffusion models trained with gradient descent towards this particular solution remains an open question and we leave it as future work. F More Discussion on Section 4 While in Section 4 we mainly focus on the discussion of the behavior of diffusion denoisers in the intermediate-noise regime, in this section we study the denoiser dynamics in both low and high-noise regime. We also provide additional experiment results on CIFAR-10 dataset. F.1 Behaviors in Low-noise Regime We visualize the score differences between DG and Dθ in low-noise regime in Figure 16. The left figure demonstrates that when the dataset size becomes smaller than a certain threshold, the score difference at σ = 0 remains persistently non-zero. Moreover, the right figure shows that this difference depends solely on dataset size rather than model capacity. This phenomenon arises from two key factors: (i) Dθ converges to the identity mapping at low noise levels, independent of training dataset size and model capacity, and (ii) DG approximates the identity mapping at low noise levels only when the empirical covariance matrix is full-rank, as can be seen from (6). Since the rank of the covariance matrix is upper-bounded by the training dataset size, DG differs from the identity mapping when the dataset size is smaller than the data dimension. This creates a persistent gap between DG and Dθ, with smaller datasets leading to lower rank and consequently larger score differences. These observations align with our discussion in Appendix D. F.2 Behaviors in High-noise Regime As shown in Figure 7(a), while a decreased model scale pushes Dθ in the intermediate noise region towards DG, their differences enlarges in the high noise variance regime. This phenomenon arises be- cause diffusion models employ a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution that prioritizes intermediate noise levels, resulting in insufficient training at high noise variances. A shown in Figure 17, for high σ(t), Dθ converge to DG when trained with sufficient model capacity (Figure 17(b)) and training time (Figure 17(c)). This behavior is consistent irrespective of the training dataset sizes (Figure 17(a)). Convergence in the high-noise variance regime is less crucial in practice, since diffusion steps in Figure 16: Score differences for low-noise variances. The left and right figures are the zoomed-in views of Figure 6(a) and Figure 7(a) respectively. Notice that when the dataset size is smaller than the dimension of the image, the score differences are always non-zero at σ = 0. 23Denoising Outputs  for 𝜎𝑡=60 (PSNR = -29.5 dB)Effect of Model Scale (1094 training images) Effect of Training Epochs (1094 training images) Effect of Dataset Size𝒚=𝒙+𝜎𝑡∗𝝐 𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷!(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(68)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(1094)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(35000)𝐷#(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(70000) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(4)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(8)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(128) 𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(187)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(841)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(9173)𝐷𝜽(𝒚;𝜎(𝑡))(64210) (a) (b) (c) Figure 17: Dθ converge to DG with no overfitting for high noise variances.

F.3 Similarity between Diffusion Denoiers and Gaussian Denoisers In Section 4, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent in models with limited capacity and during early training stages, a finding qualitatively validated in Figure 18. Specifically, Figure 18(b) shows that larger models (channel sizes 128 and 64) tend to memorize, 24MemorizationGeneralization (a) (b) Figure 19: Large dataset size prompts the Gaussian structure.

Figure(a) shows that smaller model scale leads to increased similarity between DG and Dθ in the intermediate noise regime (σ ∈ [0.1, 10]), resulting in structurally similar generated images as shown in figure(b). However, smaller scale leads to larger score differences in high-noise regime due to insufficient training from limited model capacity. directly retrieving training data as denoising outputs. In contrast, smaller models (channel sizes 8 and 4) exhibit behavior similar to DG, producing comparable denoising outputs. Similarly, Figure 18(c) reveals that during early training epochs (0-841), Dθ outputs progressively align with those of DG. However, extended training beyond this point leads to memorization. F.4 CIFAR-10 Results The effects of model capacity and training duration on the Gaussian inductive bias, as demonstrated in Figures 19 to 21, extend to the CIFAR-10 dataset. These results confirm our findings from Section 4: the Gaussian inductive bias is most prominent when model scale and training duration are limited. G Additional Experiment Results While in the main text we mainly demonstrate our findings using EDM-VE diffusion models trained on FFHQ, in this section we show our results are robust and extend to various model architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models, but it is a fundamental property of denoising autoencoders [37]. Lastly, we verify that our 25GeneralizationMemorization (a) (b) Figure 21: Diffusion model learns the Gaussian structure in early training epochs.

Figures(a), (b) and (c) correspond to diffusion models trained on FFHQ, with EDM-VE, EDM-ADM and EDM-VP network architectures specified in [4] respectively. conclusions remain consistent when using alternative metrics such as NMSE instead of the RMSE used in the main text. G.1 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various Network Architectures We first demonstrate that diffusion models capture the Gaussian structure of the training dataset, irrespective of the deep network architectures used. As shown in Figure 22 (a), (b), and (c), although the actual diffusion models, Dθ, are parameterized with different architectures, for all noise variances except σ(t) ∈ {0.002, 80.0}, their corresponding linear models, DL, consistently converge towards the common Gaussian models, DG, determined by the training dataset. Qualitatively, as depicted in Figure 23, despite variations in network architectures, diffusion models generate nearly identical images, matching those generated from the Gaussian models. G.2 Gaussian Inductive Bias as a General Property of DAEs In previous sections, we explored the properties of diffusion models by interpreting them as collections of deep denoisers, which are equivalent to the denoising autoencoders (DAEs) [37] trained on various noise variances by minimizing the denoising score matching objective(3). Although diffusion models and DAEs are equivalent in the sense that both of them are trying to learn the score function of the 26Figure 23: Images sampled from various model. The figure shows the sampled images from diffusion models with different network architectures and those from their corresponding Gaussian models. noise-mollified data distribution [38], the training objective of diffusion models is more complex [4]: min θ Ex,ϵ,σ[λ(σ)cout(σ)2||Fθ(x + ϵ, σ) − 1 cout(σ)(x − cskip(σ)(x + ϵ)) | {z } linear combination of x and ϵ ||2 2], (52) where x ∼ pdata, ϵ ∼ N(0, σ(t)2I) and σ ∼ ptrain. Notice that the training objective of diffusion models has a few distinct characteristics: • Diffusion models use a single deep network Fθ to perform denoising score matching across all noise variances while DAEs are typically trained separately for each noise level. • Diffusion models are not trained uniformly across all noise variances. Instead, during training the probability of sampling a given noise level σ is controlled by a predefined distribution ptrain and the loss is weighted by λ(σ). • Diffusion models often utilize special parameterizations (13). Therefore, the deep network Fθ is trained to predict a linear combination of the clean image x and the noise ϵ, whereas DAEs typically predict the clean image directly. Given these differences, we investigate whether the Gaussian inductive bias is unique to diffusion models or a general characteristic of DAEs. To this end, we train separate DAEs (deep denoisers) using the vanilla denoising score matching objective (3) on each of the 10 discrete noise variances specified by the EDM schedule [80.0, 42.415, 21.108, 9.723, 4.06, 1.501, 0.469, 0.116, 0.020, 0.002], and compare the score differences between them and the corresponding Gaussian denoisers DG. We use no special parameterization so that Dθ = Fθ; that is, the deep network directly predicts the clean image. Furthermore, the DAEs for each noise variance are trained till convergence, ensuring all noise levels are trained sufficiently. We consider the following architectural choices: • DAE-NCSN: In this setting, the network Fθ uses the NCSN architecture [3], the same as that used in the EDM-VE diffusion model. • DAE-Skip: In this setting, Fθ is a U-Net [ 39] consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization [40], leaky ReLU activation [41] and convolutional skip connections. We refer to this network as ”Skip-Net”. Compared to NCSN, which adapts the state of the art architecture designs, Skip-Net is deliberately constructed to be as simple as possible to test how architectural complexity affects the Gaussian inductive bias. • DAE-DiT: In this setting, Fθ is a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) introduced in [42]. Vision Transformers are known to lack inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance that are inherent to convolutional models [43]. Here we are interested in if this affects the Gaussian inductive bias. 27Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models )(+#;-(.)) (a) (b) Figure 24: Comparison between DAEs and diffusion models. Figure(a) compares the score field approximation error between Gaussian models and both (i) diffusion models (EDM vs. Gaussian) and (ii) DAEs with varying architectures. Figure(b) illustrates the generation trajectories of different models initialized from the same noise input. • DAE-Linear: In this setting we set Fθ to be a linear model with a bias term as in (8). According to Theorem 1, these models should converge to Gaussian denoisers. The quantitative results are shown in Figure 24(a). First, the DAE-linear models well approximateDG across all 10 discrete steps (RMSE smaller than 0.04), consistent with Theorem 1. Second, despite the differences between diffusion models (EDM) and DAEs, they achieve similar score approximation errors relative to DG for most noise variances, meaning that they can be similarly approximated by DG. However, diffusion models exhibit significantly larger deviations fromDG at higher noise variances (σ ∈ {42.415, 80.0}) since they utilize a bell-shaped noise sampling distribution ptrain that emphasizes training on intermediate noise levels, leading to under-training at high noise variances. Lastly, the DAEs with different architectures achieve comparable score approximation errors, and both DAEs and diffusion models generate images matching those from the Gaussian model, as shown in Figure 24(b). These findings demonstrate that the Gaussian inductive bias is not unique to diffusion models or specific architectures but is a fundamental property of DAEs. G.3 Gaussian Structure Emerges across Various datasets As illustrated in Figure 25, for diffusion models trained on the CIFAR-10, AFHQ and LSUN-Churches datasets that are in the generalization regime, their generated samples match those produced by the corresponding Gaussian models. Additionally, their linear approximations, DL, obtained through linear distillation, align closely with the Gaussian models, DG, resulting in nearly identical generated images. These findings confirm that the Gaussian structure is prevalent across various datasets. G.4 Strong Generalization on CIFAR-10 Figure 26 demonstrates the strong generalization effect on CIFAR-10. Similar to the observations in Section 5, reducing model capacity or early stopping the training process prompts the Gaussian inductive bias, leading to generalization. G.5 Measuring Score Approximation Error with NMSE While in Section 3.1 we define the score field approximation error between denoisers D1 and D2 with RMSE ( (10)), this error can also be quantified using NMSE: Score-Difference(t) := Ex∼pdata(x),ϵ∼N(0;σ(t)2I) ||D1(x + ϵ) − D2(x + ϵ)||2 ||D1(x + ϵ)||2 . (53) As shown in Figure 27, while the trend in intermediate-noise and low-noise regimes remains unchanged, NMSE amplifies differences in the high-noise variance regime compared to RMSE. This amplified score difference between DG and Dθ does not contradict our main finding that diffusion models in the generalization regime exhibit an inductive bias towards learning denoisers 28Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated Samples Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) Final Generated SamplesLSUN-Churches AFHQ(a) (b) (c) (d) Final Generated SamplesCIFAR- 10Generation Trajectories  (                    )  for Various Models +(-#;/(0)) image 1image 2image 3image 4image 5 (e) (f) Figure 25: Final generated images and sampling trajectories for various models.

Figures(b), (d) and (f) demonstrate the corresponding sampling trajectories. approximately equivalent to DG in the high-noise variance regime. As discussed in Section 3.2 and appendices F.2 and G.2, this large score difference stems from inadequate training in this regime. Figure 27 (Gaussian vs. DAE) demonstrates that when DAEs are sufficiently trained at specific noise variances, they still converge to DG. Importantly, the insufficient training in the high-noise variance regime minimally affects final generation quality. Figure 25(f) shows that while the diffusion model (EDM) produces noisy trajectories at early timesteps ( σ ∈ {80.0, 42.415}), these artifacts quickly disappear in later stages, indicating that the Gaussian inductive bias is most influential in the intermediate-noise variance regime. Notably, even when Dθ are inadequately trained in the high-noise variance regime, they remain approximable by linear functions, though these functions no longer match DG. 29Early Stopping Decrease Scale Non-overlapping datasets with size 25000, model scale 64 Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 25000)Generated Images from Gaussian Models (size 782) Non-overlapping datasets with size 782, model scale 128 Early Stopping at Epoch 921 Decrease the Model Scale to 4 (a) (b) (c) Strong generalizability under small dataset size (782) Figure 26: Strong generalization on CIFAR-10 dataset.

H Discussion on Geometry-Adaptive Harmonic Bases H.1 GAHB only Partially Explain the Strong Generalization Recent work [20] observes that diffusion models trained on sufficiently large non-overlapping datasets (of the same class) generate nearly identical images. They explain this ”strong generalization” phenomenon by analyzing bias-free deep diffusion denoisers with piecewise linear input-output 30mappings: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))x (54) = X k λk(xt)uk(xt)vT k (xt)xt, (55) where λk(xt), uk(xt), and vk(xt) represent the input-dependent singular values, left and right singular vectors of the network Jacobian ∇D(xt; σ(t)). Under this framework, strong generalization occurs when two denoisers D1 and D2 have similar Jacobians: ∇D1(xt; σ(t)) ≈ ∇D2(xt; σ(t)). The authors conjecture this similarity arises from networks’ inductive bias towards learning certain optimal ∇D(xt; σ(t)) that has sparse singular values and the singular vectors of which are the geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHB)—near-optimal denoising bases that adapt to input xt. While [20] provides valuable insights, their bias-free assumption does not reflect real-world diffusion models, which inherently contain bias terms. For feed forward ReLU networks, the denoisers are piecewise affine: D(xt; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))xt + bxt, (56) where bxt is the network bias that depends on both network parameterization and the noisy input xt [44]. Here, similar Jacobians alone cannot explain strong generalization, as networks may differ significantly in bxt. For more complex network architectures where even piecewise affinity fails, we consider the local linear expansion of D(xt; σ(t)): D(xt + ∆x; σ(t)) = ∇D(xt; σ(t))∆xt + D(xt; σ(t)), (57) which approximately holds for small perturbation ∆x. Thus, although ∇D(xt; σ(t)) characterizes D(xt; σ(t))’s local behavior around xt, it does not provide sufficient information on the global properties. Our work instead examines global behavior, demonstrating that D(xt; σ(t)) is close to DG(xt; σ(t))—the optimal linear denoiser under the Gaussian data assumption. This implies that strong generalization partially stems from networks learning similar Gaussian structures across non-overlapping datasets of the same class. Since our linear model captures global properties but not local characteristics, it complements the local analysis in [20]. H.2 GAHB Emerge only in Intermediate-Noise Regime For completeness, we study the evolution of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across various noise levels σ(t). The results are presented in Figures 28 and 29, which reveal three distinct regimes: • High-noise regime [10,80]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors6 of the Jacobian matrix ∇D(xt; σ(t)) well align with those of the Gaussian weights (the leading principal components of the training dataset), consistent with our finding that diffusion denoisers approximate linear Gaussian denoisers in this regime. Notice that DAEs trained sufficiently on separate noise levels (Figure 29) show stronger alignment compared to vanilla diffusion models (Figure 28), which suffer from insufficient training at high noise levels. • Intermediate-noise regime [0.1,10]: In this regime, GAHB emerge as singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) diverge from the principal components, becoming increasingly adaptive to the geometry of input image. • Low-noise regime [0.002,0.1]. In this regime, the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) show no clear patterns, consistent with our observation that diffusion denoisers approach the identical mapping, which has unconstrained singular vectors. Notice that the leading singular vectors of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) are the input directions that lead to the maximum variation in denoised outputs, thus revealing meaningful information on the local properties of D(xt; σ(t)) at xt. As demonstrated in Figure 30, perturbing input xt along these vectors at difference noise regimes leads to distinct effects on the final generated images: (i) in the high-noise regime where the leading singular vectors align with the principal components of the training dataset, 6We only care about leading singular vectors since the Jacobians in this regime are highly low-rank. The less well aligned singular vectors have singular values near 0. 31Generation Trajectories                     &(\"#;$(%)) (a) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  )%)(\"#) (b) )( )) )* (c) *+(\",)across Various $(%)   (d) (e) (f) *&(\",)across Various $(%)   *-(\",)across Various $(%)   Figure 28: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels. Figure(a) shows the generation trajectory. Figure(b) shows the correlation matrix between Jacobian singular vectors U(xt) and training dataset principal components U. Notice that the leading singular vectors of U(xt) and U well align in early timesteps but diverge in later timesteps. Figure(c) shows the first three principal components of the training dataset while figures(d-f) show the evolution of Jacobian’s first three singular vectors across noise levels. These singular vectors initially match the principal components but progressively adapt to input image geometry, before losing distinct patterns at very low noise levels. While we present only left singular vectors, right singular vectors exhibit nearly identical behavior and yield equivalent results. perturbing xt along these directions leads to canonical changes such as image class, (ii) in the intermediate-noise regime where the GAHB emerge, perturbing xt along the leading singular vectors modify image details such as colors while preserving overall image structure and(iii) in the low-noise regime where the leading singular vectors have no significant pattern, perturbing xt along these directions yield no meaningful semantic changes. These results collectively demonstrate that the singular vectors of the network Jacobian∇D(xt; σ(t)) have distinct properties at different noise regimes, with GAHB emerging specifically in the intermedi- ate regime. This characterization has significant implications for uncertainty quantification [45] and image editing [46]. 32(a)))(\"+)across Various $(%)   (b))*(\"+)across Various $(%)   (c))((\"+)across Various $(%)   (d) Correlation Matrices                       across Various  $(%)  (%((\"+) Figure 29: Evolution of ∇D(xt; σ(t)) across varying noise levels for DAEs.

At very low noise variances, perturbation has no significant effect (Figure (c)). Similar effects are observed in concurrent work [46].

Consequently, fine-tuning well pre-trained, large-scale models for specific tasks has become increasingly crucial in practice [53, 59, 55]. During the past years, the deep learning community has concentrated on how to transfer knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models with minimal computational and memory demands, a process known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) [19, 58, 53, 7, 20, 31]. The central insight of these approaches is to update as few parameters as possible while avoiding performance decline. However, the intrinsic transfer properties of diffusion models have remained largely unexplored, with scant attention paid to effectively fine-tuning from a pre-trained diffusion model. Previous studies on neural network transferability, such as those by [ 32, 56], have demonstrated that lower-level features are generally more transferable than higher-level features. In the context of diffusion models, which transform noise into data through a reverse process, it is logical to assume that the initial stages, which are responsible for shaping high-level objects, differ in transferability ∗Equal contribution Preprint. arXiv:2406.00773v2  [cs.LG]  6 Jun 2024from later stages that refine details. This differential transferability across the denoising stages presents an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of fine-tuning. In this work, we investigate the transferability within the reverse process of diffusion models. Firstly, we propose that a pre-trained model can act as a universal denoiser for lightly corrupted data, capable of recognizing and refining subtle distortions (see Figure 1). This ability leads to improved generation quality when we directly replace the fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained one under low distortion. The suboptimality observed with fine-tuned models suggests potential overfitting, mode collapse, or undesirable forgetting. Then we extend the experiments by gradually increasing the denoising steps replaced, to cover higher-level noised data, observing the boundaries of zero-shot generalization capability. This indicates that the fine-tuning objective should prioritize high-level shaping, associated with domain-specific characteristics. We term this gradual loss of adaptability the chain of forgetting, which tends to retain low-level denoising skills while forgetting high-level, domain-specific characteristics during the transfer of the pre-trained model. We further provide novel theoretical insights to reveal the principles behind the chain of forgetting. Since the chain of forgetting suggests different denoising stages lead to different forgetting preferences, it is reasonable to develop a transfer strategy that balances the degrees of forgetting and retention. Technically, based on the above motivation, we propose Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple but general fine-tuning approach for diffusion models. Diff-Tuning extends the conventional fine- tuning objectives by integrating two specific aims: 1) knowledge retention, which retains general denoising knowledge; 2) knowledge reconsolidation, which tailors high-level shaping characteristics to specific downstream domains. Diff-Tuning leverages the chain of forgetting to balance these two complementary objectives throughout the reverse process. Experimentally, Diff-Tuning achieves significant performance improvements over standard fine- tuning in two mainstream fine-tuning scenarios: conditional generation and controllable generation with ControlNet [59]. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • Motivated by the transferable features of deep neural networks, we explore the transferability of diffusion models through the reverse process and observe a chain of forgetting tendency. We provide a novel theoretical perspective to elucidate the underlying principles of this phenomenon for diffusion models. • We introduce Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple yet effective transfer learning method that integrates two key objectives: knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation. Diff- Tuning harmonizes these two complementary goals by leveraging the chain of forgetting. • As a general transfer approach, Diff-Tuning achieves significant improvements over its stan- dard fine-tuning counterparts in conditional generation across eight datasets and controllable generation using ControlNet under five distinct conditions. Notably, Diff-Tuning enhances the transferability of the current PEFT approaches, demonstrating the generality. 2 Related Work 2.1 Diffusion Models Diffusion models [ 16] and their variants [ 46, 47, 22] represent the state-of-the-art in generative modeling [12, 3], capable of progressively generating samples from random noise through a chain of denoising processes. Researchers have developed large-scale foundation diffusion models across a broad range of domains, including image synthesis [16], video generation [18], and cross-modal generation [42, 41]. Typically, training diffusion models involves learning a parametrized functionf to distinguish the noise signal from a disturbed sample, as formalized below: L(θ) =Et,x0,ϵ h\r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtx0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i (1) where x0 ∼ Xrepresents real samples, ϵ ∼ N(0, I) denotes the noise signal, and xt = √αtx0 +√1 − αtϵ is the disturbed sample at timestep t. Sampling from diffusion models following a Markov chain by iteratively denoising from xT ∼ N(0, I) to x0. Previous research on diffusion models primarily focuses on noise schedules [ 35, 22], training objectives [43, 22], efficient sampling [45], and model architectures [38]. In contrast to these existing 2Relative Gain (FID) Improve by zero-shot denoising from pre-trained knowledge Performance drops  due to domain-specific  characteristics Replaced Steps (𝑡) Disturbed  Fine-tuned  Diff-Tuning Pre-trained  Fine-tuned  Diff-Tuning Pre-trained Disturbed Figure 1: Case study of directly replacing the denoiser with the original pre-trained model on lightly disturbed data (left). The changes in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) as the denoising steps are incrementally replaced by the original pre-trained model (right). works, our method investigates the transferability of diffusion models across different denoising stages and enhances the transfer efficacy in a novel and intrinsic way. 2.2 Transfer Learning Transfer learning [37] is an important machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the perfor- mance of target tasks by leveraging knowledge from source domains. Transferring from pre-trained models, commonly known as fine-tuning, has been widely proved effective in practice, especially for the advanced large-scale models [5, 1, 12]. However, directly fine-tuning a pre-trained model can cause overfitting, mode collapse, and catastrophic forgetting [23]. Extensive prior work has focused on overcoming these challenges to ultimately enhance the utilization of knowledge from pre-trained models [2, 8, 60]. However, effective transfer of diffusion models has received scant attention. Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) With significant advancements in the development of large-scale models [ 10, 5, 1, 12], research in transfer learning has increasingly concentrated on PEFT methods that minimize the number of learnable parameters. The primary goal of PEFT is to reduce time and memory costs associated with adapting large-scale pre-trained models. Techniques such as incorporating extra adapters [19, 59, 34] and learning partial or re-parameterized parameters [58, 20, 21, 14] are employed for their effectiveness in reducing computational demands. Nevertheless, the reliance on deep model architectures and the necessity of carefully selecting optimal placements present substantial challenges. Intuitively, PEFT approaches could potentially mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving most parameters unchanged; for a detailed discussion, refer to Section 4.3. Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting Catastrophic forgetting is a long-standing challenge in the context of continual learning, lifelong learning, and transfer learning, referring to the tendency of neural networks to forget previously acquired knowledge when fine-tuning on new tasks. Recent ex- ploration in parameter regularization approaches [23, 27, 26, 8] have gained prominence. Approaches such as [ 57, 28, 51] propose the data-based regularization, which involves distilling pre-trained knowledge into a knowledge bank. However, efforts to mitigate forgetting within the framework of diffusion models remain notably scarce. 3 Method 3.1 Chain of Forgetting Compared with one-way models, diffusion models specify in a manner of multi-step denoising and step-independent training objectives. Inspired by prior studies on the transferability of deep neural features [56, 32], we first explore how the transferability of diffusion models varies along the denoising steps. Pre-trained Model Serves as a Zero-Shot Denoiser Modern large-scale models are pre-trained with a large training corpus, emerging powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities. We begin by analyzing whether the pre-trained diffusion models hold similar zero-shot denoising capabilities. In particular, we utilize a popular pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model [38] as our testbed. We fine-tune the DiT model on a downstream dataset. When the reverse process comes to the the last 10% steps, we switch and continue the remaining denoising steps with the fine-tuned model, the original 3pre-trained model, and our Diff-Tuning model respectively. We visualize a case study in Figure 1 (left) with corresponding replacement setups. Surprisingly, the results reveal that replacement by the pre-trained model achieves competitive quality, even slightly better than the fine-tuned one, indicating that the pre-trained diffusion model indeed holds the zero-shot denoising skills. On the other side, some undesirable overfitting and forgetting occur when fine-tuning diffusion models. Forgetting Trend Next, we delve deeper into investigating the boundary of generalization capabili- ties for the pre-trained model. Figure 1 (right) illustrates the performance trend when we gradually increase the percentage of denoising steps replaced from 0 to 100%. Initially, this naive replacement yields better generation when applied towards the end of the reverse process. However, as more steps are replaced, performance begins to decline due to domain mismatch. This trend suggests the fine-tuned model may overfit the downstream task and forget some of the fundamental denoising knowledge initially possessed by the pre-trained model whent is small. Conversely, ast increases, the objects desirable in the new domain are distorted by the pre-trained model, resulting in a performance drop. Based on these observations, we conceptually separate the reverse process into two stages: (1) domain-specific shaping, and (2) general noise refining. We claim that the general noise refining stage is more transferable and can be reused across various domains. In contrast, the domain-specific shaping stage requires the fine-tuned model to forget the characteristics of the original domain and relearn from the new domains. Theoretic Insights Beyond empirical observations, we provide a novel theoretical perspective of the transfer preference for the pre-trained diffusion model. Following the objectives of diffusion models, a denoiser F (an x0-reparameterization [22] of f in Eq. (1)) is to approximate the posterior expectation of real data over distribution D. This is formalized by: F(xt) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) [x0] = R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 · pD(x0)dx0 R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · pD(x0)dx0 , (2) where pD(x0) represents the distribution of real data from D, and N denotes the Gaussian distribu- tions determined by the forward process. Notably, a larger variance of Gaussian distribution indicates a more uniform distribution. Through a detailed investigation of these Gaussian distributions under varying timesteps t, we derive the following theorem. All proofs and derivations are provided in Appendix A. Theorem 1 (Chain of Forgetting) Suppose a diffusion model with lim t→0 αt = 1 and lim t→T αt = 0 over finite samples, then the ideal denoiser F satisfies 1. lim t→0 F(xt) = argmin p(x0)>0 {∥x0 − xt∥}, i.e., the closest sample in dataset. 2. lim t→T F(xt) =Ex0∼pD(x0)[x0], i.e., the mean of data distribution. Theorem 1 elucidates the mechanism behind the chain of forgetting. On one hand, when t → 0, a model optimized on a training dataset D can perform zero-shot denoising within the vicinity of the support set supp(D). As the training dataset scale expands, so does the coverage of supp(D), enabling diffusion models to act as general zero-shot denoisers for data associated with small t. On the other hand, as t → T, the model’s generalization is significantly influenced by the distribution distance dist(ED[x0], EDnew [xnew 0 ]), where Dnew denotes the dataset of the new domain. This theorem highlights the necessity for further adaptation in the new domain. 3.2 Diff-Tuning Based on the above observations and theoretical insights, we introduce Diff-Tuning, which incor- porates two complementary strategies to leverage the chain of forgetting in the reverse process: 1) knowledge retention, and 2) knowledge reconsolidation. Diff-Tuning aims to retain general denoising skills from the pre-trained model while discarding its redundant, domain-specific shaping knowl- edge. This enables the model to adapt more effectively to the specific characteristics of downstream tasks. Diff-Tuning harmonizes the retention and reconsolidation via the chain of forgetting tendency. Without loss of generality, we present Diff-Tuning under the standard DDPM objective, omitting conditions in the formulations. The general conditional generation setup will be discussed later. 4Knowledge Retention Knowledge Reconsolidation Build Knowledge(a) Diff-Tuning(b) 𝐱! 𝐱\" 𝐱\"#$ 𝐱!⋯ ⋯ Retain ⋯ ⋯ Tune Reverse ProcessNoise Data Chain of Forgetting General Noise RefiningDomain-Specific Shaping Figure 2: The conceptual illustration of the chain of forgetting (Left). The increasing forgetting tendency as t grows. (a) Build a knowledge bank for the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. (b) Diff-Tuning leverages knowledge retention and reconsolidation, via the chain of forgetting. Knowledge Retention As discussed earlier, retaining pre-trained knowledge during the latter general noising refining proves beneficial. However, the classic parameter-regularization-based approaches [23, 8, 26] mitigate forgetting uniformly across the reverse process, primarily due to the parameter-sharing design inherent in diffusion models. To address this, Diff-Tuning constructs an augmented dataset bXs = {bxs, ···} , pre-sampled from the pre-trained model. This dataset acts as a repository of the retained knowledge of the pre-trained model. We define the auxiliary training objective, Lretention, as follows: Lretention(θ) =Et,ϵ,bxs 0∼ bXs h ξ(t) \r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtbxs 0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i , (3) where ξ(t) is the retention coefficient. In accordance with the principles of the chain of forgetting, ξ(t) decreases monotonically with increasing t, promoting the retention of knowledge associated with small t values and the discarding of knowledge related to large t values. Knowledge Retention shares a similar formulation with the pre-training objective but without the reliance on the original pre-training dataset. Knowledge Reconsolidation In contrast to knowledge retention, knowledge reconsolidation fo- cuses on adapting pre-trained knowledge to new domains. The intuition behind knowledge reconsoli- dation is to diminish the conflict between forgetting and adaptation by emphasizing the tuning of knowledge associated with large t. This adaptation is formalized as follows: Ladaptaion(θ) =Et,ϵ,x0∼X h ψ(t) \r\rϵ − fθ \u0000√αtx0 + √ 1 − αtϵ, t \u0001\r\r2i , (4) where ψ(t) is the reconsolidation coefficient, a monotonic increasing function within the range [0, 1], reflecting increased emphasis on domain-specific adaptation as t increases. A frustratingly simple approach Overall, we reach Diff-Tuning, a general fine-tuning approach for effective transferring pre-trained diffusion models to downstream generations, the overall objective is as follows: min θ Lretention(θ) +Ladaptation(θ), (5) where Lretention(θ) and Ladaptation(θ) are described before, θ represents the set of tunable parameters. Notably, Diff-Tuning is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with existing PEFT methods. Further details are discussed in Section 4.3. Choices of ξ(t) and ψ(t) For clarity and simplicity, we define ξ(t) = 1− ψ(t), ensuring equal weighting for each t, following the original DDPM configuration. This complementary design excludes the influences of recent studies on the t-reweighting techniques [22, 12, 9]. From the above 5discussion, we can choose any monotonic increase function whose range falls in the [0, 1]. In this work, we scale the variable t to the interval [0, 1], and apply a simple power function groupψ(t) =tτ for practical implementation. In our experiments, we report the main results with τ = 1, and the variations of the choice are explored in Section 4.4. Conditional Generation Classifier-free guidance (CFG) [17] forms the basis for large-scale con- ditional diffusion models. To facilitate sampling with CFG, advanced diffusion models such as DiT [ 38] and Stable Diffusion [ 12] are primarily trained conditionally. CFG is formulated as ϵ = (1 +w)ϵc − wϵu, where w, ϵc, ϵu are the CFG weight, conditional output, and unconditional output. As a general approach, Diff-Tuning inherits the conditional training and sampling setup to support a wide range of transfer tasks. Due to the mismatch between the pre-training domain and downstream tasks in the conditional space, we apply knowledge retention Lretention on the un- conditional branch and knowledge reconsolidation Ladaptation on both unconditional and conditional branches. 4 Experiments To fully verify the effectiveness of Diff-Tuning, we extensively conduct experiments across two main- stream fine-tuning scenarios: 1) Class-conditional generation, which involves eight well-established fine-grained downstream datasets, and 2) Controllable generation using the recently popular Control- Net [59], which includes five distinct control conditions. 4.1 Transfer to Class-conditional Generation Setups Class-conditioned generation is a fundamental application of diffusion models. To fully evaluate transfer efficiency, we adhere to the benchmarks with a resolution of256 × 256 as used in DiffFit [53], including datasets such as Food101 [4], SUN397 [52], DF20-Mini [39], Caltech101 [13], CUB-200-2011 [49], ArtBench-10 [29], Oxford Flowers [ 36], and Stanford Cars [ 25]. Our base model, the DiT-XL-2-256x256 [38], is pre-trained on ImageNet at 256 × 256 resolution, achieving a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [15] of 2.27 2. The FID is calculated by measuring the distance between the generated images and a test set, serving as a widely used metric for evaluating generative image models’ quality. We adhere to the default generation protocol as specified in [53], generating 10K instances with 50 DDIM [45] sampling steps (FID-10K). βcfg weight is set to 1.5 for evaluation. For the implemented DiffFit baseline, we follow the optimal settings in [53], which involve enlarging the learning rate ×10 and carefully placing the scale factor to 1 to 14 blocks. For each result, we fine-tune 24K iterations with a batch size of 32 for standard fine-tuning and Diff-Tuning, and a batch size of 64 for DiffFit, on one NVIDIA A100 40G GPU. For each benchmark, we recorded the Relative Promotio of FID between Diff-Tuning and Full Fine-tuning (Diff-Tuning−Full Fine-tuning Full Fine-tuning ) to highlight the effectiveness of our method. More implementation details can be found in Appendix B. Table 1: Comparisons on 8 downstream tasks with pre-trained DiT-XL-2-256x256.

Compared with other baselines, our Diff-Tuning consistently exhibits the lowest FID across all benchmarks, outperforming the standard fine-tuning by a significant margin (relative 26.0% overpass), In contrast, some PEFT techniques do not yield improved results compared to standard fine-tuning. A detailed comparison with DiffFit is discussed in subsequent sections. 4.2 Transfer to Controllable Generation Suddenconvergencepickedthreshold Figure 3: An example of evaluating dissimilarities between conditions (the Normal condition) to infer the occurrence of sudden convergence. Setups Controlling diffusion models enables personaliza- tion, customization, or task-specific image generation. In this section, we evaluate Diff-Tuning on the popular Con- trolNet [59], a state-of-the-art controlling technique for dif- fusion models, which can be viewed as fine-tuning the sta- ble diffusion model with conditional adapters at a high level. We test Diff-Tuning under various image-based conditions provided by ControlNet 3, including Sketch [ 50], Edge [ 6], Normal Map [ 48], Depth Map [ 40], and Segmentation on the COCO [30] and ADE20k [61] datasets at a resolution of 512×512. We fine-tune ControlNet for 15k iterations for each condition except 5k for Sketch and 20k for Segmentation on ADE20k, using a batch size of 4 on one NVIDIA A100 40G GPU. For more specific training and inference parameters, refer to Appendix B. Evaluation through Sudden Convergence Steps Due to the absence of a robust quantitative metric for evaluating fine-tuning approaches with ControlNet, we propose a novel metric based on the sudden convergence steps. In the sudden convergence phenomenon, as reported in [59], ControlNet tends not to learn control conditions gradually but instead abruptly gains the capability to synthesize images according to these conditions after reaching a sudden convergence point. This phenomenon is observable in the showcases presented in Figure 4 throughout the tuning process. We propose measuring the (dis-)similarity between the original controlling conditions and the post-annotated conditions of the corresponding controlled generated samples. As depicted in Figure 3, a distinct “leap” occurs along the training process, providing a clear threshold to determine whether sudden convergence has occurred. We manually select this threshold, combined with human assessment, to identify the occurrence of sudden convergence. The detailed setup of this metric is discussed in Appendix C. Results As demonstrated in Table 2, Diff-Tuning consistently requires significantly fewer steps to reach sudden convergence across all controlling conditions compared to standard fine-tuning of ControlNet, indicating a consistent enhancement in the transfer efficiency. In Figure 4, we display showcases from the training process both with and without Diff-Tuning. It is observed that Diff- Tuning achieves sudden convergence significantly faster, enabling the generation of well-controlled samples more quickly. By comparing the images from the final converged model at the same step, it is evident that our proposed Diff-Tuning achieves superior image generation quality.

This strategy ensures that knowledge from previously learned tasks is not overwritten. In transfer learning, however, the objective shifts to adapting a pre-trained model for new, downstream tasks. This adaptation often presents unique challenges. Prior studies indicate that PEFT methods struggle to match the performance of full model fine-tuning unless modifications are carefully implemented. Such modifications include significantly increasing learning rates, sometimes by more than tenfold, and strategically placing tunable parameters within suitable blocks [20, 7, 53]. Consider the state-of-the-art method, DiffFit, which updates only the bias terms in networks, merely 0.12% of the parameters in DiT equating to approximately 0.83 million parameters. While this might seem efficient, such a small proportion of tunable parameters is enough to risk overfitting downstream tasks. Increasing the learning rate to compensate for the limited number of trainable parameters can inadvertently distort the underlying pre-trained knowledge, raising the risk of training instability and potentially causing a sudden and complete degradation of the pre-trained knowledge, as observed in studies like [53]. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) [23] is a classic parameter-regularized approach to preserve knowledge in a neural network. We calculate the L2-EWC values, which are defined as EWC = ∥θ − θ0∥2, for the tunable parameters in the evaluated approaches [27]. The EWC value quantifies how far the fine-tuned model deviates from the pre-trained model, indicating the degree of knowledge forgetting from the perspective of parameter space. Figure 5(b) reveals that DiffFit leads to EWC values that are 2.42 times larger with only 0.12% tunable parameters, indicating heavy distortion of the pre-trained knowledge. Figure 5(c) illustrates the averaged EWC over tunable parameters, showing that each tunable bias term contributes significantly more to the EWC. In contrast, Diff-Tuning achieves lower EWC values. Diff-Tuning does not explicitly focus on avoiding forgetting in the parameter space but rather harmonizes the chain of forgetting in the parameter-sharing diffusion model and only retains knowledge associated with small t rather than the entire reverse process. 8Diff-Tuning can be directly applied to current PEFT approaches, and the comparison results in Figure 5 demonstrate that Diff-Tuning can enhance the transfer capability of DiffFit and significantly improve converged performance. 4.4 Analysis and Ablation Fine-tuning Convergence Analysis To analyze converging speed, we present a concrete study on the convergence of the FID scores for standard fine-tuning, DiffFit, Diff-Tuning, and Diff-Tuning∗ (DiffFit equipped with Diff-Tuning) every 1,500 iterations in the SUN 397 dataset, as shown in Figure 6(a). Compared to standard fine-tuning and DiffFit, Diff-Tuning effectively leverages the chain of forgetting, achieving a balance between forgetting and retaining. This leads to faster convergence and superior results. Furthermore, the result of Diff-Tuning∗ indicates that PEFT methods such like DiffFit still struggle with forgetting and overfitting. These methods can benefit from Diff-Tuning. Tradeoff the Forgetting and Retraining with the Chain of Forgetting For simplicity and ease of implementation, Diff-Tuning adopts a power function, ψ(t) =t, as the default reconsolidation coeffi- cient. To explore sensitivity to hyperparameters, we conduct experiments using various coefficient functions ψ(t) =tτ with τ values from the set {0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5}, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based function ψ(t) = 1/(1 +SNR(t)) [9]. Results on the Stanford Car dataset, shown in Figure 6(c), a carefully tuned coefficient can yield slightly better results. To keep the simplicity, we keep the default setting τ = 1. Notably, when τ = 0, Diff-Tuning reduces to the standard fine-tuning. Analysis on Knowledge Retention In Diff-Tuning, knowledge is retained using pre-sampled data from pre-trained diffusion models before fine-tuning. We evaluate the impact of varying sample sizes (5K, 50K, 100K, 200K, and the entire source dataset) on the performance of the DiT model on the Stanford Car dataset, as illustrated in Figure 6(d). Notably, using the entire source dataset, which comprises 1.2M ImageNet images, results in suboptimal outcomes. This observation underscores that pre-sampled data serve as a more precise distillation of pre-trained knowledge, aligning with our goal of retraining knowledge rather than merely introducing extra training data. Ablation Study we explore the efficacy of each module within Diff-Tuning, specifically focusing on knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation. We assess Diff-Tuning against its variants where: (1) Only reconsolidation is applied, setting ξ(t) ≡ 0 and ψ(t) =t; and (2) Only retention is employed, setting ξ(t) = 1− t and ψ(t) ≡ 1. The results, illustrated in Figure 6(b) demonstrate that both knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation effectively leverage the chain of forgetting to enhance fine-tuning performance. The FID scores reported on the DF20M dataset clearly show that combining these strategies leads to more efficient learning adaptations. 14.74 13.57 13.65 12.57 6.04 5.62 5.36 5.58 5.34 5.37 5.96 5.56 5.54 5.52 5.50 5.39 (a) Convergence analysis on SUN 397 (b) Ablation study on DF20M (c) The sensitivity of 𝜏\tin 𝜓 𝑡 on Car (d) Analysis on the #samples in memory on Car 𝜓 𝑡 = 1 1 + SNR(𝑡) Standard fine-tuning Recon.

We present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple but general transfer learning approach designed for pre-trained diffusion models, leveraging the identified trend of the chain of forgetting. Diff-Tuning effectively enhances transfer performance by integrating knowledge retention and knowledge reconsolidation techniques. Experimentally, Diff-Tuning shows great generality and performance in advanced diffusion models, including conditional generation and controllable synthesis. Additionally, Diff-Tuning is compatible with existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. 9References [1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

In CVPR, 2017. 12A Proofs of Theoretical Explanation in Section 3.1 In this section we provide the formal definations and proofs for theoretical explanation of chain of forgetting. From the setup of diffusion model training and previous works [ 22], we suppose the dataset consists of finite bounded samples D = {x(1) 0 , x(2) 0 , ...,x(n) 0 }, and f is the denoiser to minimize L(θ) as in Eq. (1) under ϵ-parameterization. For convenience, we first convert the denoiser into x0-parameterization by F(xt) =xt−√1−αtf(xt)√αt and the objective becomes L = Et,x0,xt h ∥x0 − F(xt)∥2 i . (6) Ideal Denoiser in Eq. (6). An ideal denoiser F should minimize the value F(xt) for all t, xt almost surely, implying an objective for F(xt): Lt,xt (F(xt)) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) h ∥x0 − F(xt)∥2 i . (7) By taking a derivative, it holds that 0 =∇F(xt)Lt,xt (F(xt)) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt) [−2 (x0 − F(xt))] , (8) and finally, F(xt) =Ex0∼p(x0|xt)[x0] (9) = Z x0 x0 · p(x0|xt)dx0 (10) = R x0 x0 · pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 pD(xt) (11) = R x0 x0 · pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 R x0 pD(x0)p(xt|x0)dx0 (12) = R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 · pD(x0)dx0 R x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · pD(x0)dx0 (13) = P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 (14) Remark. This ideal denoiser is exactly the same one as [22] under DDPM-style definition. Case when t → 0. When t → 0, αt → 1. For simplicity suppose the closest sample to xt is unique. Let xclosest 0 = argminx0∈D∥√αtx0 − xt∥2, (15) d = min x0∈D\\{xclosest 0 } ∥√αtx0 − xt∥2 − ∥√αtxclosest 0 − xt∥2 > 0, (16) then 0 ≤ \r\r\r\r\r P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 − xclosest 0 \r\r\r\r\r (17) ≤ X x0∈D\\{xclosest} \r\r\r\r\r 1p 2π(1 − αt) exp \u0012−∥√αtx0 − xt∥2 + ∥√αtxclosest 0 − xt∥2 2(1 − αt) \u0013\r\r\r\r\r (18) ≤ X x0∈D\\{xclosest} \r\r\r\r\r 1p 2π(1 − αt) exp \u0012 − d 2(1 − αt) \u0013\r\r\r\r\r → 0 (19) as αt → 1, i.e., P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 · x0 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 → xclosest 0 . (20) 13Similarly P x0∈D N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 N \u0000 xt; √αtxclosest 0 , (1 − αt)I \u0001 → 1, (21) and thus F(xt) → xclosest 0 , which completes the proof. Notably, when there are multiple closest samples, through similar analysis it is clear that F(xt) converges to their average. Case when t → T. When t → T, αt → 0, and thus N \u0000 xt; √αtx0, (1 − αt)I \u0001 → N \u0000 xt; 0, I \u0001 , a constant for varying x0. Bringing this back to Eq. (14) and it holds that F(xt) = 1 n X x0∈D x0, (22) which completes the proof. B Implementation Details We provide the details of our experiment configuration in this section. All experiments are imple- mented by Pytorch and conducted on NVIDIA A100 40G GPUs. B.1 Benchmark Descriptions This section describes the benchmarks utilized in our experiments. B.1.1 Class-conditional Generation Tasks Food101 [4] The dataset consists of 101 food categories with a total of 101,000 images. For each class, 750 training images preserving some amount of noise and 250 manually reviewed test images are provided. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels. SUN397 [52] The SUN397 benchmark contains 108,753 images of 397 well-sampled categories from the origin Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database. The number of images varies across categories, but there are at least 100 images per category. We evaluate the methods on a random partition of the whole dataset with 76,128 training images, 10,875 validation images and 21,750 test images. DF20M [39] DF20 is a new fine-grained dataset and benchmark featuring highly accurate class labels based on the taxonomy of observations submitted to the Danish Fungal Atlas. The dataset has a well-defined class hierarchy and a rich observational metadata. It is characterized by a highly imbalanced long-tailed class distribution and a negligible error rate. Importantly, DF20 has no intersection with ImageNet, ensuring unbiased comparison of models fine-tuned from ImageNet checkpoints. Caltech101 [49] The Caltech 101 dataset comprises photos of objects within 101 distinct categories, with roughly 40 to 800 images allocated to each category. The majority of the categories have around 50 images. Each image is approximately 300×200 pixels in size. CUB-200-201 [49] CUB-200-2011 (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011) is an expansion of the CUB- 200 dataset by approximately doubling the number of images per category and adding new annotations for part locations. The dataset consists of 11,788 images divided into 200 categories. Artbench10 [29] ArtBench-10 is a class-balanced, standardized dataset comprising 60,000 high- quality images of artwork annotated with clean and precise labels. It offers several advantages over previous artwork datasets including balanced class distribution, high-quality images, and standardized data collection and pre-processing procedures. It contains 5,000 training images and 1,000 testing images per style. Oxford Flowers [ 36] The Oxford 102 Flowers Dataset contains high quality images of 102 commonly occurring flower categories in the United Kingdom. The number of images per category range between 40 and 258. This extensive dataset provides an excellent resource for various computer vision applications, especially those focused on flower recognition and classification. 14Cheese cake Fried  calamari Grilled salmonGyoza Panna cotta Food101 SUN397 Covered bridgeDamDinerJacuzziWet bar Caltech101 Dollar billHeadphoneNautilusPyramidStarﬁsh CUB-200-201 Brandt  cormorant Least  Flycatcher Great grey  shrike Tree  swallowBewick wren BaroqueImpressionism Post  impressionismRenaissanceUkiyoe Artbench10 DF20M Amanita  ceciliae Bas Russula  curtipes  Russula emetica  Pers Russula  luteotacta Rea Russula  xerampelina  Figure 7: Samples show of different datasets. Stanford Cars [25] In the Stanford Cars dataset, there are 16,185 images that display 196 distinct classes of cars. These images are divided into a training and a testing set: 8,144 images for training and 8,041 images for testing. The distribution of samples among classes is almost balanced. Each class represents a specific make, model, and year combination, e.g., the 2012 Tesla Model S or the 2012 BMW M3 coupe. B.1.2 Controllable Generation COCO [30] The MS COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. We adopt the version of 2017 where 164k images are split into 118k/5k/41k for training/validation/test. For each image, we randomly select one of its corresponding captions, and use detectors of Canny edge, (binarized) HED sketch, MIDAS depth/normal and Uniformer segmentation implemented in ControlNet to obtain the annotation control, and final construct the dataset of image-text-control pairs for training and evaluation. All controling condition has channel 1 except normal map and segmentation mask with channel 3. Ade20k [61] The Ade20k dataset is a semantic segmentation dataset containing nearly 21k/2k training/validation images annotated with pixel-wise segmentation mask of 149 categories of stuff and objects. For each image, we use the “default prompt” “a high-quality, detailed, and professional 15image” as adopted in ControlNet, and use Uniformer implemented in ControlNet to obtain the segmentation mask as the control to obtain the dataset of image-text-control pairs. B.2 Experiment Details Detailed Algorithm Process For all experiments, we first generate images of memory bank with the pre-trained model. We then construct conditioned dataset from memory bank with default condition (unconditional for class-conditional generation task and “default prompt” with generated control for controllable generation task). For each iteration, we devide a batch size of B by B/2 for knowledge retention and B/2 for knowledge reconsolidation, respectively, for fair comparision. Considering instability of weighted training loss with ξ(t) and ψ(t), we instead sample t from categorial distribution of ξ(t) and ψ(t) and calculate loss with the simple form. The pseudo-code of the overall algorithm process is shown in Algorithm 1.

To identify a simple signal indicating sudden convergence, we pre-collected a validation set of real images and compared the (dis-)similarity between their annotations and the corresponding generated controlled images. Figure 8 illustrates a noticeable “leap” during the training process, providing a clear indicator of sudden convergence. We established thresholds for quantitative evaluation based on test annotation similarity curves and combined them with qualitative human assessment to determine the number of steps as a metric for all tasks. C.1 Quantitative Metrics’ Details To efficiently and generally compare the (dis-)similarity between the original controlling conditions and the post-annotated conditions of the corresponding controlled generated samples, we employ the simplest reasonable metrics for each vision annotation, irrespective of task specificities such as label imbalance or semantic similarity. Specifically, we use Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) with Gaussian blurring for sparse classification (Edge and Sketch), mean-square error (MSE) for dense regression (Depth and Normal), and accuracy for dense classification (Segmentation). Detailed settings of the metrics and thresholds are provided in Table 4. Table 4: Detailed setting of quantitative metrics for controlled generation tasks. Edge Sketch Depth Normal Seg. (COCO) Seg.

By generating samples throughout the training process using a consistent random seed, we focus on identifying when and how these samples converge to their corresponding control conditions. As shown in Figure 9, our selected thresholds provide reasonable convergence discrimination across all six tasks, with Diff-Tuning consistently outperforming standard fine-tuning. 170 4k 8k 8.8k 9k 9.9k 12.5k 15k “Large factory smoke towers shadowed by a large building behind.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Depth 0 3k 6k 7.8k9k 10.3k 12k15k “Three young women are trying to catch a frisbee.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Normal 0 2k4k5.3k6k6.7k8k10k “A man in a wetsuit with surfboard standing on a beach.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Edge 0 1.5k 3k 3.2k 3.5k 3.8k 4.2k 5k “A flower vase is sitting on a porch stand.” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Sketch 0 3k 6k 7.8k 12k13.9k15k20k “a professional, detailed, high-quality image” StandardControlNetDiff-Tu n i n gControlNet Seg.

Red boxes refer to the occurence of “sudden conver- gence” 18Similarities Alone Are Imperfect It is important to note that our proposed similarity metric serves only to indicate the occurrence of convergence and does not accurately reflect sample quality or the degree of control, especially for converged samples. For example, Figure 10 compares generated samples from standard fine-tuning and our Diff-Tuning approach with edge controlling. The generated samples from Diff-Tuning are richer in detail but may score lower on edge similarity metrics, highlighting the limitations of similarity metrics and underscoring the necessity of human assessment. “vase with flowers”+ “a professional, detailed, high-quality image” StandardControlNet(0.82)Diff-Tu n i n gControlNet(0.76) Figure 10: Generated images using standard ControlNet (SSIM of 0.82) and Diff-Tuning ControlNet (SSIM of 0.76). Analyzing these cases, Diff-Tuning generates images with higher quality and more details hence results in a lower similarity, indicating the limitation of similarity metrics and the necessity of human assessment. D Limitations and Future Works Diff-Tuning consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods, demon- strating its efficacy across various downstream datasets and tasks. This section also discusses some limitations of Diff-Tuning and explores potential future directions to address these limitations. Necessity of a Pre-sampled Dataset Diff-Tuning involves constructing a pre-sampled augmented dataset for knowledge reconsolidation, which requires additional computational resources. As discussed in Section 4.4, the impact of the sample size indicates that even the smallest set of generated images outperforms baseline methods and the original source data, underscoring the value of this approach. Future work could focus on developing large-scale open-source generated samples and creating more sample-efficient augmented datasets. Extra Hyperparameters Diff-Tuning introduces additional hyperparameters, ξ(t) and ψ(t), as loss weighting coefficients based on the principle of the chain of forgetting. These introduce extra hyperparameter spaces. As detailed in Section 4.4, our analysis shows that simple designs for these coefficients perform well and robustly. Future research could aim to design more effective weighting coefficients to further enhance performance. 19",

In particular, they have shown excellent performance and flexibility in a wide range of image gener- ation settings, including unconditional [28, 47], class-conditional [22], and text-conditional image generation [1, 48, 55]. Consequently, improving diffusion models has garnered significant interest. The framework of diffusion models [20, 66, 71] comprises gradually corrupting the data towards a given noise distribution and its subsequent reverse process. A model is optimized by minimizing the weighted sum of denoising score-matching losses across various noise levels [20, 69] for learning the reverse process. This can be interpreted as diffusion training aiming to train a single shared model to ∗Co-first author 1,2,4,5Work done while at Riiid †Corresponding author 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023). arXiv:2306.00354v3  [cs.CV]  30 Dec 2023denoising its input across various noise levels. Therefore, diffusion training is inherently multi-task learning (MTL) in nature, where each noise level represents a distinct denoising task. However, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective remains under- explored. In particular, sharing one model between tasks may lead to competition between conflicting tasks, resulting in a phenomenon known as negative transfer [24, 25, 57, 78], leading to poorer performance compared to learning individual tasks with separate models. Negative transfer has been a critical issue in MTL research, and related works have demonstrated that the performance of multi-task models can be improved by remediatingnegative transfer [24, 25, 57, 78, 83]. Considering these, we argue that negative transfer should be investigated in diffusion models, and if present, addressing it is a potential direction for improving diffusion models. In this paper, we characterize how multi-task diffusion model is, and whether there exists negative transfer in denoising tasks. In particular, (O1) we first observe that task affinity [12, 78] between two denoising tasks is negatively correlated with the difference in noise levels, indicating that they may be less conflict as the noise levels become more similar [78]. This suggests that adjacent denoising tasks should be considered more harmonious tasks than non-adjacent tasks in terms of noise levels. Next, (O2) we observe the presence of negative transfer from diffusion model training. During sampling within a specific timestep interval, utilizing a model trained exclusively on denoising tasks within that interval generates higher-quality samples compared to a model trained on all denoising tasks simultaneously. This finding implies that simultaneously learning all denoising tasks can cause degraded denoising within a specific time interval, indicating the occurrence of negative transfer. Based on these observations, we focus on improving diffusion models by addressingnegative transfer. To achieve this, we first propose to leverage the existing multi-task learning techniques, such as dealing with issues of conflicting gradients [5, 83], differences in gradient magnitudes [42, 46, 64], and imbalanced loss scales [4, 16, 29]. However, unlike previous MTL studies that typically focused on small sets of tasks, the presence of a large number of denoising tasks (≈ thousands) in diffusion models makes it computationally expensive since MTL methods generally require calculating per-task loss or gradient in each iteration [4, 5, 16, 24, 29, 42, 46, 64, 78, 83]. To address this, we propose a strategy that first clusters the entire denoising tasks and then applies multi-task learning methods to the resulting clusters. Specifically, inspired by (O1), we formulate the interval clustering problem which groups denoising tasks by pairwise disjoint timestep intervals. Based on the interval clustering, we propose timesteps, signal-to-noise ratios, and task affinity score- based interval clustering and show that these can be clustered by dynamic programming as [2, 76, 49]. Through our strategy, we can address the issue of negative transfer in diffusion models by allowing for efficient computation of multi-task learning methods. We evaluated our proposed methods through extensive experiments on widely-recognized datasets: FFHQ [27], CelebA-HQ [26], and ImageNet [7]. For a comprehensive analysis, we employed various models, including Ablated Diffusion Model (ADM) [8], Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) [56], and Diffusion Transformer (DiT) [52]. These models represent diverse diffusion architectures spanning pixel-space, latent-space, and transformer-based paradigms. Our results underscore a significant enhancement in image generation quality, attributed to a marked reduction in negative transfer. This affirms the merits of our clustering proposition and its synergistic integration with MTL techniques. 2 Related Work Diffusion Models Diffusion models [20, 66, 71] are a family of generative models that generate samples from noise via a learned denoising process. Diffusion models beat other likelihood-based models, such as autoregressive models [62, 75], flow models [9, 10], and variational autoencoders [32] in terms of sample quality, and sometimes outperform GANs [ 14] in certain cases [8]. Moreover, pre-trained diffusion models can be easily applied to downstream image synthesis tasks such as image editing [30, 45] and plug-and-play generation [13, 15]. From these advantages, several works have applied diffusion models for various domains [3, 23, 38, 44, 54] and large-scale models [48, 56, 58]. Several studies have focused on improving diffusion models in various aspects, such as architecture [1, 8, 28, 52, 82], sampling speed [33, 60, 67], and training objectives [6, 17, 31, 70, 74]. Among these, the most closely related studies are improving training objectives, as we aim to enhance optimization between denoising tasks from the perspective of multi-task learning (MTL). Several works [31, 70, 74] 2redesign training objectives to improve likelihood estimation. However, these objectives may lead to sample quality degradation and training instability and require additional techniques such as importance sampling [70, 74] and sophisticated parameterization [ 31] to be successfully applied. On the other hand, P2 [6] proposes a weighted training objective that prioritizes denoising tasks for certain noise levels, where the model is expected to learn perceptually rich features. Similar to P2, we aim to improve the sample quality of diffusion models from an MTL perspective, and we will show that our method is also beneficial to P2. As a concurrent work, MinSNR [ 17] shares a common insight with us that diffusion training is essentially multi-task learning. However, their observation lacks a direct connection to negative transfer in terms of sample quality. They address the instability and inefficiency of multi-task learning optimization in diffusion models, mainly due to a large number of denoising tasks. In contrast, our work delves deeper into exploring negative transfer and task affinity, and we propose the application of MTL methods through task clustering to overcome the identified challenges in MinSNR. Multi-Task Learning Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is an approach that trains a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously [57]. Although sharing parameters between tasks can reduce the overall number of parameters, it may also result in a negative transfer, causing performance degradation because of conflicting tasks during training procedure [24, 25, 57, 78]. Prior works have tracked down three causes of negative transfer: (1) conflicting gradient, (2) the difference in gradient magnitude, and (3) imbalanced loss scale. First, Conflicting gradients among different tasks may negate each other, resulting in poorer updates for a subset of, or even for all tasks. PCgrad [83] and Graddrop [5] mitigate this by projecting conflicting parts of gradients and dropping elements of gradients based on the degree of conflict, respectively. Second, tasks with larger gradients may dominate tasks with smaller gradients due to differences in gradient magnitude across tasks. Different optimization schemes have been proposed to equalize gradient magnitudes, including MGDA-UB [64], IMTL-G [42], and NashMTL [46]. Similarly, imbalanced loss scales may cause tasks with smaller losses to be dominated by those with larger losses. To balance task losses, uncertainty [29], task difficulty [16], and gradient norm [4] is exploited. Adapting MTL methods and negative transfer formulation to diffusion models is challenging since these techniques are typically designed for scenarios with a small number of tasks and easily measurable individual task performance. Our goal is to address this challenge and demonstrate that observing negative transfer in diffusion models and mitigating it can improve them. 3 Preliminaries and Observation We first provide the necessary background information on diffusion models and their multi-task nature. Next, we conduct analyses that yield two important observations: (O1) task affinity between two tasks is negatively correlated with the difference in noise levels, and(O2) negative transfer indeed exists in diffusion training, i.e., the model is overburdened with different, potentially conflicting tasks. 3.1 Preliminaries Diffusion model [20, 66, 71] consists of two processes: a forward process and a reverse process. The forward process q gradually injects noise into a datapoint x0 to obtain noisy latents {x1, . . . ,xT } as: q(xt|x0) = N(xt|atx0, σ2 t I), q (xt|xs) = N(xt|αt|sxs, (σ2 t − α2 t|sσ2 s)I), 1 ≤ s < t≤ T (1) where αt, σt characterize the signal-to-noise ratio SNR(t) = α2 t /σ2 t , and αt|s = αt/αs. Here, SNR(t) decreases in t, such that by the designated final timestep t = T, q(xT ) ≈ N(0, I). The reverse process is a parameterized model trained to restore the original data from data corrupted during the forward process. The widely adopted training scheme uses a simple noise-prediction objective [8, 20, 34, 56, 59] that trains the model to predict the noise component ϵ of the latent xt = αtx0 + σϵ, ϵ ∼ N(0, I). More formally, the objective is as follows: Lsimple = Et,x0,ϵ[Lt], where Lt = ||ϵ − ϵθ(xt, t)||2 2. (2) Let us denote by Dt the denoising task at timestep t trained by minimizing the loss Lt (Eq. 2). Then, since a diffusion model jointly learns multiple denoising tasks {Dt}t=1,...,T using a single shared model ϵθ, it can be regarded as a multi-task learner. Also, we denote by D[t1,t2] the set of tasks {Dt1 , Dt1+1, . . . ,Dt2 } henceforth. 31 200 400 600 800 10001 200 400 600 800 1000  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (a) ADM (timestep t) -9.0 -6.0 -3.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 9.0 -9.0 -6.0 -3.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 9.0  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (b) ADM (log-SNR) 1 200 400 600 800 10001 200 400 600 800 1000 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (c) LDM (timestep t) -8.0 -6.0 -4.0 -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 -8.0 -6.0 -4.0 -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (d) LDM (log-SNR) Figure 1: Task affinity scores plotted against timestep and log-SNR axes in ADM and LDM.

If NT Gis negative, D[·,·]-trained model outperforms the entire denoising tasks-trained model in terms of denoising latent {xt}t∈[·,·], showing the occurrence of negative transfer. Negative transfer occurs in both ADM and LDM. 3.2 Observation By considering diffusion training as a form of multi-task learning, we can analyze how the diffusion model learns the denoising task. We experimentally analyze diffusion models with two concepts in multi-task learning: 1) Task affinity [72, 12]: measuring which combinations of denoising tasks may yield a more positive impact on performance. 2) Negative transfer [ 68, 24, 25, 57, 78, 83]: degradation in denoising tasks caused by multi-task learning. We use a lightweight ADM [8] used in [6] and LDM [56] with FFHQ 256×256 dataset [27] for analyze diffusion models trained on both pixel and latent space. (O1) Task Affinity Analysis We first analyze how the denoising tasks D[1,T] relate to each other by measuring task affinities [72, 12]. In particular, we adopt the gradient direction-based task affinity score [78]: for two given tasks Di and Dj, we calculate the pairwise cosine similarity between gradients from each task loss, i.e., ∇θLi and ∇θLj, then average the similarities across training iterations. Task affinity score assumes that cooperative (conflicting) tasks produce similar (conflicting) gradient directions, and it has been to correlate with the MTL model’s overall performance [ 78]. Although there have been attempts to divide diffusion model phases using signal-to-noise ratio [6] and a trace of covariance of training targets [81], we are the first to provide an explicit and fine-grained analysis of task affinities among denoising tasks. In Fig. 1, we visualize the task affinity scores among denoising tasks, for both ADM and LDM, with both timestep and log-SNR as axes. As can be seen in Fig. 1, task affinity between two tasks Di, Dj is high for neighboring tasks, i.e., i ≈ j, and decreases smoothly as the difference in SNRs (or timesteps) increases. This suggests that tasks sharing temporal/noise-level proximity can be cooperatively learned without significant conflict. Also, this result hints at the possibility that denoising tasks for vastly different SNRs (distant in timesteps) may potentially be conflicting. (O2) Negative Transfer Analysis Next, we show that there exist negative transfers among different denoising tasks D[1,T]. Negative transfer refers to a multi-task learner’s performance degradation due to task conflicts, and it can be identified by observing the performance gap between a multi-task learner and specific-task learners. For ease of observation, we group up tasks by intervals, based on 4the observation (O1) that more neighboring tasks in timesteps have higher task affinity. Specifically, we investigate whether the task group D[t1,t2] suffers negative impacts from the remaining tasks. To quantify the negative transfer, we follow the procedure: First, we generate samples{˜x0} using a model trained on all denoising tasks D[1,T]. Next, we repeat the same sampling procedure, except we replace the model with a model trained on D[t1,t2] for the latent {xt}t∈[t1,t2]; We denote the resulting samples by {˜x[t1,t2] 0 }. If {˜x[t1,t2] 0 } exhibits superior quality compared to {˜x0}, it indicates that the model trained solely on D[t1,t2] performs better in denoising the latent {xt}t∈[t1,t2] than the model trained on the entire denoising task. This suggests that D[t1,t2] suffers from negative transfer by learning other tasks. More formally, given a performance metric P, FID [18] in this paper, we define the negative transfer gap: NT G(D[t1,t2]) := P({˜x[t1,t2] 0 }) − P({˜x0}), (3) where NT G <0 indicates that negative transfer occurs. The relationship between the negative transfer gap in previous literature and our negative transfer gap is described in Appendix A. We visualize the negative transfers among denoising tasks for both lightweight ADM [ 6, 8] and LDM [56] in Fig. 2. The results indicate that negative transfer occurs in three out of the five considered task groups for both models. Notably, negative transfers often have a significant impact, such as a 7.56 increase in FID for ADM in the worst case. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is room for improving the performance of diffusion models by mitigating negative transfer, which motivates us to leverage well-designed MTL methods for diffusion training. 4 Methodology In Section 3.2, we make two observations: (O1) Denoising tasks with a larger difference in t and SNR(t) exhibit lower task affinity,(O2) Negative transfer occurs in diffusion training. Inspired by these observations, we aim to remediate the negative transfer in diffusion by leveraging MTL methods. Although MTL methods are reported effective when there are only a few tasks, they are impractical for diffusion models with a large number of denoising tasks since they require computing per-task gradients or loss at each iteration. In this section, to deal with challenges, we propose a strategy that first groups the denoising tasks as task clusters and then applies the multi-task learning methods by regarding each task cluster as one distinct task. 4.1 Interval Clustering Here, we first introduce a scheme that groups all denoising tasks D[1,T] into a small number of task clusters. This is a necessary step for applying well-established MTL methods, for they usually involve computationally expensive subroutines such as computing per-task gradients or loss in each training iteration. Our key idea is to enforce temporal proximity of denoising tasks within task clusters, given our observation (O1) that task affinity is higher for tasks closer in timesteps. Therefore, we assign tasks in pairwise disjoint time intervals. To obtain the disjoint time intervals, we leverage an interval clustering algorithm [ 2, 49] that op- timizes for various clustering costs. In our case, interval clustering assigns diffusion timesteps X = {1, . . . , T} to k contiguous intervals I1, . . . , Ik, with `k i=1 Ii ∩ X= X, where ` denotes disjoint union. Let Ii = [li, ri], li ≤ ri for i = 1, . . . , k, then we have l1 = 1, and ri = li+1 − 1 (i < kand rk = T). The interval clustering problem is defined as: min l1=1<l2<...<lk kX i=1 Lcluster(Ii ∩ X), (4) where Lcluster denotes the cluster cost. Generally, it is known that an interval clustering problem of n data points with k intervals can be solved via dynamic programming in O(n2kω(n)) [49], where ω(n) is the time required to calculate the one-cluster cost for Lcluster(X). If the size of each cluster is too small, it is challenging to learn the corresponding task cluster, so we add constraints on the cluster size for dynamic programming. More details regarding the dynamic programming algorithm can be found in Appendix G. It remains to design the clustering cost function Lcluster to optimize for. We present three clustering cost functions: timestep-based, SNR-based, and gradient-based. 51. Timestep-based Clustering Cost Intuitively, one simple clustering cost is based on timesteps. We use the absolute timestep difference for the clustering objective by setting Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) =Pri t=li ||ti center − t||1 1 in Eq. 4 where ti center denotes the center of interval Ii. The resulting intervals divide up the timesteps into k uniform intervals. 2. SNR-based Clustering Cost Another useful metric to characterize a denoising task is its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Indeed, it has been previously observed that a denoising task encounters perceptually different noisy inputs depending on its SNR [ 6]. Also, we already observed that denoising tasks with similar SNRs show high task affinity scores (see Section 3.2). Based on this, we use the absolute log-SNR difference for clustering cost. We define the clustering cost as Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) = Pri t=li ||log SNR(ti center) − log SNR(t)||1 1. 3. Gradient-based Clustering Cost Finally, we consider the gradient direction-based task affinity scores (see Section 3.2 for a definition) for clustering cost. Task affinity scores have been used as a metric to group cooperative tasks [78]. Based on a similar intuition, we design a clustering cost as follows: Lcluster(Ii ∩ X) = −Pri t=li TAS(ti center, t) where TAS(·) is the gradient-based task affinity score. While leveraging more fine-grained information regarding task affinities, this cost function requires computing and storing gradients throughout training. 4.2 Incorporating MTL Methods into Diffusion Model Training After dividing the denoising tasks into task clusters via interval clustering, we apply multi-task learning methods to the resulting task clusters. As mentioned in Section 2, previous multi-task learning works have tracked down the following causes for negative transfer: (1) conflicting gradient, (2) difference in gradient magnitude, and (3) imbalanced loss scale. In this work, we leverage one representative method that tackles each of the causes mentioned above, namely, (1) PCgrad [83], (2) NashMTL [46], and (3) Uncertainty Weighting [29]. For each training step in diffusion modeling, we compute the noise prediction loss Ll for the l-th data within the minibatch. As shown in Eq 2, calculating Ll involves sampling the timestep tl, in which case Ll is a loss incurred on the denoising task Dtl . We may then assign Li to the appropriate task cluster by considering the corresponding timestep. Subsequently, we may group up the losses as {LIi}i=1,...,k, where LIi is the loss for the i-th task cluster. (More details in Appendix C) 1. PCgrad [83] In each iteration, PCgrad projects the gradient of a task onto the normal plane of the gradient of another task when there is a conflict between their gradients. Specifically, PCgrad first calculates the per-interval gradient ∇θLIi. Then, if the other interval gradient ∇θLIj for i ̸= j has negative cosine similarity with ∇θLIi, it projects ∇θLIi onto the normal plane of ∇θLIj . PCgrad repeats this process with all of the other interval gradients for all interval gradients, resulting in a projected gradient per interval. Finally, model parameters are updated with the summation of projected gradients. 2. NashMTL [46] In NashMTL, the aggregation of per-task gradients is treated as a bargaining game. It aims to update model parameters with weighted summed gradients ∆θ = Pk i=i αi∇θLIi by obtaining the Nash bargaining solution to determine αi, where ∆θ is in the ball of radius ϵ centered zero, Bϵ. They define the utility function for each player as ui = ⟨∇θLIi, ∆θ⟩, then the unique Nash bargaining solution can be obtained by arg max∆θ∈Bϵ P i log(ui). By denoting G as matrix whose columns contain the gradients ∇θLIi, α ∈ Rk + is the solution to G⊺Gα = 1/α where 1/α is the element-wise reciprocal. To avoid the optimization to obtain α for each iteration, they update α once every few iterations. 3. Uncertainty Weighting (UW) [29] UW uses task-dependent (homoscedastic) uncertainty to weight task cluster losses. By utilizing observation noise parameter σi for i-th task clusters, the total loss function is P i LIi/σ2 i + log(σi). As the noise parameter for the i-th task clusters loss σi increases, the weight of LIi decreases, and vice versa. The σi is discouraged from increasing too much by regularizing with log(σi). 5 Experiments In this section, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method by addressing the negative transfer issue in diffusion training. First, we provide the comparative evaluation in Section 5.1, where 6Table 1: Quantitative comparison to vanilla training (Vanilla) on the unconditional generation.

Next, we compare previous loss weighting methods for diffusion models to UW with interval clustering in Section 5.2, verifying our superior effectiveness to existing methods. Then, we analyze the behavior of adopted MTL methods, which serve to explain the effectiveness of our method in Section 5.3. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be readily combined with more sophisticated training objectives to boost performance even further in Section 5.4. Extensive information on all our experiments can be found in Appendix E. 5.1 Comparative Evaluation Experimental Setup Here, we demonstrate that incorporating MTL methods into diffusion training improves the performance of diffusion models. For comparison, we consider unconditional and class-conditional image generation. For unconditional image generation, we used FFHQ [27] and CelebA-HQ [26] datasets, where all images were resized to 256 × 256. For class-conditional image generation experiments, we employed the ImageNet dataset [7], also resized to 256 × 256 resolution. For architecture, we adopt widely recognized architectures for image generation. Specifically, we use the lightweight ADM [6, 8] and LDM [56] for unconditional image generation, while employing DiT-S/2 [52] with classifier-free guidance [19] for class-conditional image generation. We train the model using our method: We consider every possible pair of (1) interval clustering (timestep-, SNR-, and gradient-based) and (2) MTL method (PCgrad, NashMTL, and Uncertainty Weighting (UW)), and report the results. We used k = 5 in interval clustering throughout experiments. For evaluation metrics, we use FID [ 18] and precision [ 36] for measuring sample quality, and recall [36] for assessing sample diversity and distribution coverage. IS [61] is additionally used for the evaluation metric in the class-conditional image generation setting. Finally, for sample generation, we use DDIM [67] sampler with 50 steps for unconditional generation and DDPM 250 steps for class conditional generation, and all evaluation metrics are calculated using 10k generated samples. Comparison in Unconditional Generation As seen in Table 1 our method significantly improves performance upon conventionally trained diffusion models (denoted vanilla in the table). In particular, there is an improvement in FID in all cases, and an improvement in precision scores in all but two cases, which highlights the efficacy of our method. Also, given strong results for both pixel- and latent-space models, we can reasonably infer that our method is generally applicable. We also observe the distinct characteristics of each multi-task learning method considered. Uncertainty Weighting tends to achieve higher improvements in sample quality compared to PCgrad and NashMTL. Indeed, UW achieves superior FID and Precision for ADM, while excelling in Precision for LDM. 71.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 30 40 50 60 70 80FID 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 20 30 40 50 60IS 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60Precision 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Guidance scale 0.44 0.46 0.48 0.50 0.52 0.54Recall Vanilla UW-Time UW-Grad UW-SNR Nash-Time Nash-Grad Nash-SNR PCgrad-Time PCgrad-Grad PCgrad-SNR Figure 3: Quantitative comparison to vanilla training (Vanilla) on ImageNet 256 ×256 dataset with DiT-S/2 architecture and classifier-free guidance.

Meanwhile, NashMTL scores higher in recall and lower in precision compared to other methods, suggesting it has better distribution coverage while sacrificing sample quality. Finally, PCgrad tends to show a balanced performance in terms of precision and recall. We further look into behaviors of different MTL methods in Section 5.3. Due to space constraints, we provide a comprehensive collection of generated samples in Appendix F. In summary, diffusion models trained with our method produce more realistic and high-fidelity images compared to conventionally trained diffusion models. Comparison in Class-Conditional Generation We illustrate the results of quantitative comparison on class-conditional generation in Fig. 3. The results show that our methods outperform vanilla training in FID, IS, and Precision. In particular, UW and Nash-MTL significantly boost these metrics, showing superior improvement in generation quality. These results further support the generalizability of MTL methods through the interval clustering on class-conditional generation and the transformer-based diffusion model. 5.2 Comparison to Loss Weighting Methods Since UW is a loss weighting method, validating the superiority of UW with interval clustering compared to previous loss weighting methods such as P2 [ 6] and MinSNR [ 17] highlights the effectiveness of our method. We name UW by incorporating interval clustering as Addressing Negative Transfer (ANT)-UW. We trained DiT-L/2 with MinSNR and UW with k = 5 on the ImageNet across 400K iterations, using a batch size of 256. All methods are trained by AdamW optimizer [43] with a learning rate of 1e − 4. Table 2 shows that ANT-UW dramatically outperforms MinSNR, emphasizing the effectiveness of our method. An essential note is that the computational cost of ANT-UW remains remarkably similar to vanilla training as shown in Section 5.3, ensuring that our enhanced performance does not come at the expense of computational efficiency. Additionally, we refer to the results in [50], showing that our ANT-UW outperforms P2 and MinSNR when DIT-L/2 is trained on the FFHQ dataset. 5.3 Analysis To provide a better understanding of our method, we present various analysis results here. Specifically, we compare the memory and runtime of MTL methods, analyze the behavior of MTL methods adopted, provide a convergence analysis, and assess the extent to which negative transfer has been addressed. 8I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 0.00 0.42 0.64 0.74 0.80 0.42 0.00 0.54 0.66 0.72 0.64 0.54 0.00 0.53 0.61 0.74 0.66 0.53 0.00 0.35 0.80 0.72 0.61 0.35 0.00 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad 0 1 2 3 4 Iteration ×105 10 1 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0 1 2 3 4 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 4: Behavior of multi-task learning methods across training iterations.

Compared to baselines, all methods exhibit fast convergence and achieve good final performance. Memory and Runtime Comparison We first compared the memory usage and runtime between MTL methods and vanilla training for a deeper understanding of their cost. We conducted measure- ments of memory usage and runtime with k = 5 on the FFHQ dataset using the LDM architecture and timestep-based clustering, and the results are shown in Table 3. PCgrad has a slower speed of 1.523 iterations/second compared to vanilla training, but its GPU memory usage is lower due to the partitioning of minibatch samples. Meanwhile, NashMTL has a runtime of 2.011 iterations/second. Even though NashMTL uses more GPU memory, it has a better runtime than PCgrad because it com- putes per-interval gradients occasionally. Concurrently, UW shows similar runtime and GPU memory usage as vanilla training, which is attributed to its use of weighted loss and a single backpropagation process. Behavior of MTL Methods We analyze the behavior of different multi-task learning methods during training. For PCgrad, we calculate the average number of gradient conflicts between task clusters per iteration. For UW, we visualize the weights allocated to the task cluster losses over training iterations. Finally, for NashMTL, we visualize the weights allocated to per-task-cluster gradients over training iterations. We used LDM trained on FFHQ for our experiments. Although we only report results for time-based interval clustering for conciseness, we note that MTL methods exhibit similar behavior across different clustering methods. Results obtained using other clustering methods can be found in Appendix D.1. The resulting visualizations are provided in Fig. 4. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the task pair that shows the most gradient conflicts is I1 and I5, namely, task clusters apart in timesteps. This result supports our hypothesis that temporally distant denoising tasks may be conflicting, and as seen in Section 5.1, PCgrad seems to mitigate this issue. Also, as depicted in Fig. 4b and 4b, both UW and NashMTL tend to allocate higher weights to task clusters that handle noisier inputs, namely, I4, I5. This result suggests that handling noisier inputs may be a difficult task that is underrepresented in conventional diffusion training. Faster Convergence In Fig. 5, we plot the trajectory of the FID score over training iterations, as observed while training on FFHQ. We can observe that all our methods enjoy faster convergence and better final performance compared to the conventionally trained model. Notably, for pixel space 9[1, 200] [201, 400] [401, 600] [601, 800] [801, 1000] -7.94 -4.40 -0.85 2.70 6.24 ADM NTG  (FID) Vanilla PCgrad-Time PCgrad-SNR PCgrad-Grad Nash-Time Nash-SNR Nash-Grad UW-Time UW-SNR UW-Grad [1, 200] [201, 400] [401, 600] [601, 800] [801, 1000] -0.90 -0.53 -0.15 0.22 0.60 LDM NTG (FID) Figure 6: Negative transfer gap (NTG) comparison on the FFHQ dataset. Integration of MTL methods tends to improve the negative transfer gap. Methods that fail to improve NTG in areas where the baseline records low NTG tend to achieve lesser improvements in the baseline. diffusion (ADM), UW converges extremely rapidly, while beating the vanilla method by a large margin. Overall, these results show that our method may not only make diffusion training more effective but also more efficient. Reduced Negative Transfer Gap We now demonstrate that our proposed method indeed mitigates the negative transfer gap we observed in Section 3.2. We used the same procedure introduced in Section 3.2 to calculate the negative transfer gap for all methods considered, for the FFHQ dataset. As shown in Fig. 6 our methods improve upon negative transfer gaps. Specifically, for tasks that exhibit severe negative transfer gaps in the baseline (e.g., [601, 800], [801, 1000] for ADM, and [401, 600], [601, 800] for LDM), our methods mitigate the negative transfer gap for most cases, even practically removing it in certain cases. Another interesting result to note is that models less effective in reducing negative transfer (NashMTL-SNR for LDM and PCgrad-Grad for ADM) indeed show worse FID scores, which supports our hypothesis that resolving negative transfer leads to performance gain. We also note that even the worst-performing methods still beat the vanilla model. 5.4 Combining MTL Methods with Sophisticated Training Objectives Table 4: Combining our method with P2 on the FFHQ dataset.

Specifically, we train an LDM by applying both UW and PCgrad on top of the P2 objective [6] and evaluate the performance on the FFHQ dataset. We chose UW and PCgrad based on a previous finding that combining the two methods leads to performance gain [41]. Also, we chose the gradient-based clustering method due to its effectiveness for LDM on FFHQ. As seen in Table 4, when combined with P2, our method improves the FID from 7.21 to 5.84. 6 Conclusion In this work, we studied the problem of better training diffusion models, with the distinction of reducing negative transfer between denoising tasks in a multi-task learning perspective. Our key contribution is to enable the application of existing multi-task learning techniques, such as PCgrad and NashMTL, that were challenging to implement due to the increasing computation costs associated with the number of tasks, by clustering the denoising tasks based on their various task affinity scores. Our experiments validated that the proposed method effectively mitigated negative transfer and improved image generation quality. Overall, our findings contribute to advancing diffusion models. Starting from our work, we believe that addressing and overcoming negative transfer can be the future direction to improve diffusion models. 10References [1] Yogesh Balaji, Seungjun Nah, Xun Huang, Arash Vahdat, Jiaming Song, Karsten Kreis, Miika Aittala, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, Bryan Catanzaro, et al. ediffi: Text-to-image diffusion models with an ensemble of expert denoisers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01324, 2022. 1, 2, 17 [2] Richard Bellman.

For the source task Tsrc and the target task Ttgt, the negative transfer can be defined as the phenomenon that the source task negatively transfer to the target task. Denote the model trained on both source and target task as Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) and the model only trained on the target task as Θ(Ttgt). With performance measure P for the model on Ttgt, negative transfer can be quantified by utilizing negative transfer gap (NT G): NT G(Ttgt, Tsrc) = P(Θ(Ttgt)) − P(Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc)). (5) For P, higher is better, NT G >0 indicates that negative transfer occurs, showing that additionally training on Tsrc negatively affects the learning of Ttgt. In our study of negative transfer in diffusion models, the target task involves denoising tasks within a specific timestep interval as Ttgt = D[t1,t2], while the source task comprises the remaining denoising tasks as Tsrc = D[1,T] \\ D[t1,t2]. However, since a model trained only a subset of entire denoising tasks cannot generate samples properly, we cannot utilize the sample quality metrics (e.g. FID [18]) for P to measure P(Θ(Ttgt)) in Eq. 5 for arbitrary timestep intervals. This is a different point from a typical MTL setting, where the performance of each task can be measured. Alternatively, we redefine NT Gwith the difference in sample quality resulting from denoising by different models, Θ(Ttgt) and Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc), in the [t1, t2] interval. During the sampling procedure with a model trained on entire denoising tasks, we use Θ(Ttgt) or Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) in [t1, t2]. Denote the resulting samples with Θ(Ttgt, Tsrc) as {˜x0} and the resulting samples with Θ(Ttgt) as {˜x[t1,t2] 0 }. Then, by comparing the quality of these samples as Eq. 3, we can measure how much the denoising of [t1, t2] degrades in terms of sampling quality. Furthermore, the success of multi-expert denoisers in prior studies [37, 13, 1] suggests the potential existence of negative transfer. By distinctly separating parameters for denoising tasks, they might mitigate this negative transfer, leading to enhanced performance in their generation. B Detailed Experimental Settings for Observational Study In this section, we provide the details on experimental settings in Section 3. The training details and the architectures used are the same as those in Section 5. All experiments are conducted with a single A100 GPU and with FFHQ dataset [27]. For the pixel-space diffusion model, we use the lightweight ADM as same in [ 6]. It inherits the architecture of ADM [8], but it uses fewer base channels, fewer residual blocks, and a self-attention with a single resolution. Specifically, the model uses one residual block per resolution with 128 base channels and 16×16 self-attention with 64 head channels. A linear schedule with T = 1000 is used for diffusion scheduling. We referenced the training scripts in the official code2 for implementation. For the latent-space diffusion model, we use the LDM architecture as the same settings for FFHQ experiments in [ 56]. Specifically, an LDM-4-VQ encoder and decoder are used, in which the resolution of latent vectors is reduced by four times compared to the original images and has a vector quantization layer with 8092 codewords. The denoising model has 224 base channels with multipliers for each resolution as 1, 2, 3, 4 and has two residual blocks per resolution. Self-attention with 32 head channels is used for 32, 16, and 8 resolutions. For diffusion scheduling, the linear schedule with T = 1000 is used. We conducted experiments with the official code3. In general, we utilized the pre-trained weights provided by LDM. However, if our retraining results demonstrated superior performance, we reported them. Task Affinity Analysis To measure the task affinity score between denoising tasks, we first calculate ∇θLt for t = 1, . . . , Tevery 10K iterations during training. The gradient is calculated with 1000 samples in the training dataset. Then, the pairwise cosine similarity of the gradient is computed and 2https://github.com/jychoi118/P2-weighting 3https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion 17I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000014 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000019/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad /uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000016/uni00000017 /uni0000002c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051×/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I1 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I2 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I3 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I4 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 7: Behavior of multi-task learning methods through SNR-based interval clustering across training iterations. A similar trend as in Fig. 3 is observed. their cosine similarities calculated by every 10K iterations are averaged. Finally, we can plot the average cosine similarity against the timestep axis as in Fig. 1. For plotting them against the log-SNR axis, the values of the axis were adjusted, and the empty parts were filled with linear interpolation. For ADM and LDM, the pairwise cosine similarity between gradients is calculated during 1M training iterations and 400K training iterations, respectively. Negative Transfer Analysis To calculate the negative transfer gap in Eq. 3, we need to additionally train the model on denoising tasks within specific timestep interval[t1, t2]. Since we plot five intervals [1, 200], [201, 400], [401, 600], [601, 800], and [801, 1000], we trained the model on denoising tasks for each interval. Each model is trained for 600K iterations in ADM and 300K iterations in LDM on the FFHQ dataset. For the model trained on entire denoising tasks, we used the trained model the same as in Section 5.1. ADM is trained on 1M iterations and LDM is trained on 400K iterations. All of these models are trained with the same batch size and learning rate as experiments in Section 5.1 (See Appendix E). DDIM 50-step sampler [ 67] was used for the generation. FID is calculated with Clean-FID [ 51] by setting the entire 70K FFHQ dataset as reference images. Since the official code of Clean-FID4 supports FID calculation with statistics from these reference images, we used it and reported FID with 10k generated images. C Implementation Details for MTL methods We describe how MTL methods are applied in Section 4.2. To be more self-contained, we hereby present implementation details for MTL methods. For the implementation of MTL methods, we used the official code of LibMTL [39]5. NashMTL [46] supports practical speed-up by updating gradient weights α every few iterations, not every iteration. We utilize this by updatingα every 25 training iterations. D Additional Experimental Results We present additional experimental results to supplement the empirical findings presented in Section 5. In Section D.1, we provide visualizations of the behavior of MTL methods with other clustering meth- ods that were not covered in Section 5.3. Furthermore, we examine the impact of our hyperparameter, the number of clusters k, in Section D.2. To validate the effectiveness of interval clustering compared to other clustering methods, we present additional results in Section D.3. In Section D.4, we delve deeper into comparing the performance of stronger MTL baselines such as Linear Scalarization (LS) [80, 35] and Random Loss Weighting (RLW) [40] with our proposed approach. 4https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid 5https://github.com/median-research-group/LibMTL 18I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000015/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000016 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni0000001a/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017 /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000015/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000018/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001b /uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni0000001c/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000016/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000019/uni00000017/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000017/uni0000001b/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000013 (a) Average conflict in PCgrad /uni00000013/uni00000014/uni00000015/uni00000016/uni00000017 /uni0000002c/uni00000057/uni00000048/uni00000055/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051×/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000018 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000013 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000014 /uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000015 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I1 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I2 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I3 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I4 /uni0000005a/uni00000048/uni0000004c/uni0000004a/uni0000004b/uni00000057/uni00000003I5 (b) Gradient weights of NashMTL 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Iteration ×105 100 101 102 weight I1 weight I2 weight I3 weight I4 weight I5 (c) Loss weight of UW Figure 8: Behavior of multi-task learning methods through gradient-based interval clustering across training iterations.

However, we present these results in Fig. 7 and 8, which show similar trends to the observations depicted in Fig. 4. These findings suggest valuable insights into the behavior of MTL methods, regardless of the clustering objectives. Firstly, we observed a notable increase in the occurrence of conflicting gradients as the timestep difference between tasks increased. This observation suggests that the temporal distance between denoising tasks plays a crucial role in determining the frequency of conflicting gradients. Secondly, we noted that both loss and gradient balancing methods assign higher weights to task clusters with higher levels of noise. This finding indicates that these methods allocate more importance to the noisier tasks. D.2 Analysis: The Number of Interval Clusters To understand the impacts of the number of clustersk, we conducted experiments by varyingk with 2, 5, and 8. We trained a model for timestep-based, SNR-based, and gradient-based clustering with each k, resulting in nine trained models. For MTL methods, we used combined methods with UW [29] and PCgrad [83] as in Section 5.4. All training configurations such as learning rate and training iterations are the same as in Section 5.1. We evaluate 10K generated samples from the DDIM 50-step sampler [67] for all methods with the FID score [51, 18]. Table 5 shows the results. Notably, we made an intriguing observation regarding the integration of MTL methods with only two clusters, which resulted in a noteworthy enhancement in FID scores. Additionally, we found that increasing the number of clusters, denoted ask, from 2 to 5 also exhibited a positive impact on improving FID scores. However, our findings indicated that further increasing k from 5 to 8 did not yield significant improvements and resulted in similar outcomes. From these results, we conjecture that increasing the number of clusters to greater than five has no significant effect. 19Table 7: The results of Random Loss Weighting (RLW) and Linear Scalarization (LS) on the FFHQ dataset in ADM architecture.

For grouping N-tasks in deep neural networks, the early attempt [ 72] established a two-stage procedure: (1) compute MTL performance gain for all task combinations and (2) search best groups for maximizing MTL performance gain across the groups. However, performing (1) requires huge computation since MTL performance gain should be measured for all2N −1 combinations. Therefore, they reduce computation by HOA, which utilizes MTL gains on only pairwise task combinations. Also, the HOA scheme is inherited by the following work, task affinity grouping [12], which uses their defined task affinity score instead of MTL gains. Different from these works, our interval clustering aims to group the tasks with interval constraints. Table 6: Comparison inter- val clustering and high or- der approximation-based task grouping. DDIM-50 step sam- pler is used. Clustering FID-10k HOA 9.873 Interval 9.033 For a fair comparison, we use a pairwise gradient similarity averaged across training iterations between denoising tasks for the objective of HOA-based grouping and interval clustering. In this case, the HOA- based grouping becomes cosine similarity grouping used in [ 12], and interval clustering becomes gradient-based clustering in our method. However, for HOA-based grouping, a solution of brute force searching with branch-and-bound-like algorithm [72, 12] requires computational complexity of O(2N ). It incurs enormous costs in diffusion with many denoising tasks. Therefore, we use a beam- search scheme in [68]. We set the number of clusters as 5 for both methods. We apply the combined method with UW [29] and PCgrad [83] as in Section 5.3 for the resulting clusters from both HOA-based grouping and interval clustering. We trained the model on the FFHQ dataset [27] and used LDM architecture [56]. All training configurations are the same as in Section 5.1. For evaluation metrics, we use FID and its configurations are the same as in Section 5.1. Table 6 shows the results, indicating that the interval clustering outperforms HOA-based task grouping. D.4 Comparison to Random Loss Weighting and Linear Scalarization Linear Scalarization (LS) [ 80, 35] and Random Loss Weighting (RLW) [ 40] can serve as strong baselines for MTL methods. Therefore, validating the superiority of our method compared to theirs can emphasize the necessity of applying sophisticated MTL methods such as UW, PCgrad, and NashMTL. Accordingly, we provide the results of comparative experiments for LS and RLW on the FFHQ dataset using ADM architecture in Table 7. We note that all experimental configuration is the same as in vanilla training in Section 5.1. As shown in the results, LS achieves slightly worse performance than vanilla training, which suggests that simply re-framing the diffusion training task as an MTL task and applying LS is not enough. Also, RLW achieves much worse performance compared to vanilla training. It appears that the randomness introduced by loss weighting interferes with diffusion training. These results indicate that sophisticated MTL methods are indeed responsible for significant performance gain. 20E Detailed Experimental Settings in Section 5 In this section, we describe the details of experimental settings in Section 5. For validating the effectiveness in both pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models in unconditional generation, we used ADM [8] and LDM [56] as same in our observational study (refer to details of architecture in Appendix B). E.1 Detailed Settings of Comparative Evaluation and Analysis (Section 5.1 and 5.3) A single A100 GPU is used for experiments in Section 5.1 and 5.3. Setups for Unconditional Generation We trained the models on FFHQ [27] and CelebA-HQ [26] datasets. All training was performed with AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate as 1e−4 or 2e−5, and better results were reported. For ADM, we trained 1M iteration with batch size 8 for the FFHQ dataset and trained 400K iterations with batch size 16 for the CelebA-HQ dataset. For LDM, we trained 400K iterations with batch size 30 for both FFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets. We generate 10K samples with a DDIM-50 step sampler and measure FID [18], Precision [36], and Recall [36] scores. For all evaluation metrics, we use all training data as reference data. FID is calculated with clean-FID [51], and Precision and Recall are computed with publicly available code 6. All analyses are conducted above trained models. Setups for Class-Conditional Generation We trained the DiT-S/2 [52] on ImageNet dataset [7]. All training was performed with the AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate of 1e−4 or 2e − 5, and better results were reported. As in DiT [ 52], we applied the classifier-free guidance [ 19] and trained 800K iterations with a batch size of 50. All samples are generated by a DDPM 250-step sampler. For evaluation metrics, we follow the evaluation protocol in ADM [ 8], by using their evaluation code7. We used the cosine schedule [47] for noise scheduling and SD-XL V AE [53] for our V AE. E.2 Detailed Settings of Comparison to Loss Weighting Methods (Section 5.2) We trained the DiT-L/2 [52] on ImageNet dataset [7]. All training was performed with the AdamW optimizer [43] with the learning rate of 1e−4. As in DiT [ 52], we applied the classifier-free guid- ance [19] and trained 400K iterations with a batch size of 256. All samples are generated by a DDPM 250-step sampler and classifier-guidance scale of 1.5. We used the cosine schedule [47] for noise scheduling. For experiments, we used 8 A100 GPUs. E.3 Detailed Settings of Combining MTL Methods with Sophisticated Training Objectives (Section 5.4) We trained three different models: vanilla LDM, vanilla LDM with P2 [6], and vanilla LDM with P2, PCgrad [ 83], and UW [ 29] applied simultaneously. All training configurations are the same in Section 5.1 but we use 500K iterations. We generate 50K samples for evaluation with a DDIM 200-step sampler and evaluate FID. F Qualitative Results In this section, we provide qualitative comparison results, which were omitted from the main paper due to space constraints. In Figure 9, 10, 11 and 12, we visualize the generated images by all models that are used for results in Table 1. As shown in the results, we can observe that incorporating MTL methods for diffusion training can improve the quality of generated images. One noteworthy observation is that UW [29] tends to generate higher-quality images compared to NashMTL [46] and PCGrad [83]. This finding aligns with the results observed in Table 1. Moreover, we plot the randomly selected samples from 50K generated data in Fig. 13. Despite being randomly selected, the majority of the generated images exhibit remarkable fidelity. 6https://github.com/youngjung/improved-precision-and-recall-metric-pytorch 7https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion/tree/main/evaluations 21(a) Vanila  (b) PCgrad - Timestep (c) PCgrad - SNR (d) PCgrad - Gradient (e) Nash - Timestep (f) Nash - SNR (g) Nash - Gradient (h) UW - Timestep (i) UW - SNR (j) UW - Gradient Figure 9: Qualitative comparison of ADM trained on the FFHQ dataset.

G Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Interval Clustering In this section, we introduce the algorithm for optimizing the interval cluster and the implementation details. The optimal solution of interval clustering can be found using dynamic programming for a Lcluster function [ 2, 49, 76]. The sub-problem is then defined as finding the minimum cost of clustering X1,i = {1, . . . , i} into m clusters. By saving the minimum cost of clustering X1,i = {1, . . . , i} into m clusters to the matrix D[i, m], the value in D[T, k] represents the minimum clustering costs for the original problem in Eq. 4. For some timestep m ≤ j ≤ i, D[j − 1, m− 1] must contain the minimum costs for clustering X1,j−1 into (m −1) clusters [49, 76]. This establishes the optimal substructure for dynamic programming, which leads to the recurrence equation as follows: D[i, m] = min m≤j≤i \b D[j − 1, m− 1] + Lcluster(Xj,i) \t , 1 ≤ i ≤ T, 1 ≤ m ≤ k. (6) To obtain the optimal intervalsl1, . . . , lk, we use S[i, m] to record the argmin solution of Eq. 6. Then, we backtrack the solution in O(k) time from S[T, k] by assigning lm = S[lm+1 −1, m] from m = k to m = 1 by initializing lk = S[T, k]. Interval clustering with SNR-based or gradient-based objectives can produce unbalanced sizes of each interval, which causes unbalanced allocation of task clusters due to randomly sampled timestep t. Therefore, we add constraints on the size of each cluster to avoid seriously unbalanced task clusters. To add constraints on the size of each cluster ni = |Ii| = ri − li + 1 for i = 1, ..., k, we define the lower and upper bounds of it as mI and MI with mI ≤ ni k ≤ MI. In Eq. 6, the m-th cluster (i.e., Xj,i) size nm must range from mI to MI, yielding i + 1 − MI ≤ j ≤ i + 1 − mI. Furthermore, to 22(a) Vanila  (b) PCgrad - Timestep (c) PCgrad - SNR (d) PCgrad - Gradient (e) Nash - Uniform (f) Nash - SNR (g) Nash - Gradient (h) UW - Timestep (i) UW - SNR (j) UW - Gradient Figure 11: Qualitative comparison of ADM trained on the CelebA-HQ dataset.

Finally, Eq. 6 with constraints on the size of the cluster is derived as follows: D[i, m] = min max{1+(m−1)mI,i+1−MI}≤j j≤i+1−mI \b D[j −1, m−1]+ Lcluster(Xj,i) \t , 1 ≤ i ≤ T, 1 ≤ m ≤ k. (7) Specifically, we assign ⌊ T 2k ⌋ and ⌈3T 2k ⌉ to mI and MI, respectively. H Broader Impacts Revisiting Diffusion Models through Multi-Task Learning Our work revisits diffusion model training from a Multi-Task Learning aspect. We show that negative transfer still occurs in diffusion models and addressing it with MTL methods can improve the diffusion models. Starting from our work, a better understanding of the multi-task learning characteristics in diffusion models can lead to further advancements in diffusion models. Negative Societal Impacts Generative models, including diffusion models, have the potential to impact privacy in various ways. For instance, in the context of DeepFake applications, where generative models are used to create realistic synthetic media, the training data plays a critical role in shaping the model’s behavior. When the training data is biased or contains problematic content, the generative model can inherit these biases and potentially generate harmful or misleading outputs. This highlights the importance 23Figure 13: Randomly selected images from generated images of LDM with combined methods of UW, PCgrad, and P2 on the FFHQ dataset. DDIM 250-step sampler is used. of carefully selecting and curating the training data for generative models, particularly when privacy and ethical considerations are at stake. I Limitations Our work has two limitations that can be regarded as future works. Firstly, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of negative transfer in the training of diffusion models as shown in Fig. 5. This indicates that learning entire denoising tasks still causes degradation in certain denoising tasks. By successfully addressing this degradation and enabling the model to harmoniously learn entire denoising tasks, we anticipate significant improvements in the performance of the diffusion model. Secondly, our study does not delve into the architectural design aspects of multi-task learning methods. While our focus lies on model-agnostic approaches in MTL, it is worthwhile to explore the possibilities of designing appropriate architectures within an MTL framework. Previous works in diffusion models utilize timestep and noise level as input, which can be considered as using task embeddings scheme [73]. By revisiting these aspects, the architecture of the diffusion model can be further advanced in future works. 24",

However, the best way to harness the perceptual knowledge of these generative models for visual tasks is still an open question. Specifically, it is unclear how to use the prompting interface when applying diffusion back- bones to vision tasks. We find that automatically gener- ated captions can improve text-image alignment and sig- nificantly enhance a model’s cross-attention maps, lead- ing to better perceptual performance. Our approach im- proves upon the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in diffusion- based semantic segmentation on ADE20K and the cur- rent overall SOTA for depth estimation on NYUv2. Fur- thermore, our method generalizes to the cross-domain set- ting. We use model personalization and caption mod- ifications to align our model to the target domain and find improvements over unaligned baselines. Our cross- domain object detection model, trained on Pascal VOC, achieves SOTA results on Watercolor2K. Our cross-domain segmentation method, trained on Cityscapes, achieves SOTA results on Dark Zurich-val and Nighttime Driving.

Recently, a few works have shown diffusion pre-trained backbones have a strong prior for scene understanding that allows them to perform well in advanced discriminative vision tasks, such as se- mantic segmentation [17, 53], monocular depth estimation [53], and keypoint estimation [28, 43]. We refer to these works as diffusion-based perception methods. Unlike con- trastive vision language models (e.g., CLIP) [22, 26, 31], *Equal contribution. “a dog and a bird” ”in a watercolor style” Captioner Caption Modifier + Single-domain Cross-domain Depth Estimation Segmentation Object Detection Diffusion-Pretrained Vision Model CLIP Figure 1. Text-Aligned Diffusion Perception (TADP). In TADP, image captions align the text prompts and images passed to diffusion-based vision models. In cross-domain tasks, target do- main information is incorporated into the prompt to boost perfor- mance. generative models have a causal relationship with text, in which text guides image generation. In latent diffusion models, text prompts control the denoising U-Net [36], moving the image latent in a semantically meaningful di- rection [5]. We explore this relationship and find that text-image alignment significantly improves the performance of diffusion-based perception. We then investigate text-target domain alignment in cross-domain vision tasks, finding that aligning to the target domain while training on the source domain can improve a model’s target domain performance (Fig. 1). We first study prompting for diffusion-based perceptual models and find that increasing text-image alignment im- proves semantic segmentation and depth estimation perfor- 1 arXiv:2310.00031v3  [cs.CV]  1 Apr 2024mance. We find that unaligned text prompts can introduce semantic shifts to the feature maps of the diffusion model [5] and that these shifts can make it more difficult for the task-specific head to solve the target task. Specifically, we ask whether unaligned text prompts, such as averag- ing class-specific sentence embeddings ([31, 53]), hinder performance by interfering with feature maps through the cross-attention mechanism. Through ablation experiments on Pascal VOC2012 segmentation [14] and ADE20K [55], we find that off-target and missing class names degrade im- age segmentation quality. We show automated image cap- tioning [25] achieves sufficient text-image alignment for perception. Our approach (along with latent representation scaling, see Sec. 4.1) improves performance for semantic segmentation on Pascal and ADE20k by 4.0 mIoU and 1.7 mIoU, respectively, and depth estimation on NYUv2 [42] by 0.2 RMSE (+8% relative) setting the new SOTA. Next, we focus on cross-domain adaptation: can ap- propriate image captioning help visual perception when the model is trained in one domain and tested on a dif- ferent domain? Training models on the source domain with the appropriate prompting strategy leads to excellent unsupervised cross-domain performance on several bench- marks. We evaluate our cross-domain method on Pascal VOC [13, 14] to Watercolor2k (W2K) and Comic2k (C2K) [21] for object detection and Cityscapes (CS) [9] to Dark Zurich (DZ) [39] and Nighttime (ND) Driving [10] for se- mantic segmentation. We explore varying degrees of text- target domain alignment and find that improved alignment results in better performance. We also demonstrate using two diffusion personalization methods, Textual Inversion [16] and DreamBooth [37], for better target domain align- ment and performance. We find that diffusion pre-training is sufficient to achieve SOTA (+5.8 mIoU on CS→DZ, +4.0 mIoU on CS →ND, +0.7 mIoU on VOC →W2k) or near SOTA results on all cross-domain datasets with no text- target domain alignment, and including our best text-target domain alignment method further improves +1.4 AP on Wa- tercolor2k, +2.1 AP on Comic2k, and +3.3 mIoU on Night- time Driving. Overall, our contributions are as follows: • We propose a new method using automated caption generation that significantly improves performance on several diffusion-based vision tasks through increased text-image alignment. • We systematically study how prompting affects diffusion-based vision performance, elucidating the impact of class presence, grammar in the prompt, and previously used average embeddings. • We demonstrate that diffusion-based perception effec- tively generalizes across domains, with text-target do- main alignment improving performance, which can be further boosted by model personalization. 2. Related Work 2.1. Diffusion models for single-domain vision tasks Diffusion models are trained to reverse a step-wise forward noising process. Once trained, they can generate highly re- alistic images from pure noise [32, 35, 38, 52]. To con- trol image generation, diffusion models are trained with text prompts/captions that guide the diffusion process. These prompts are passed through a text encoder to generate text embeddings that are incorporated into the reverse diffusion process via cross-attention layers. Recently, some works have explored using diffusion models for discriminative vision tasks. This can be done by either utilizing the diffusion model as a backbone for the task [17, 28, 43, 53] or through fine-tuning the diffu- sion model for a specific task and then using it to generate synthetic data for a downstream model [2, 50]. We use the diffusion model as a backbone for downstream vision tasks. VPD [53] encodes images into latent representations and passes them through one step of the Stable Diffusion model. The cross-attention maps, multi-scale features, and output latent code are concatenated and passed to a task-specific head. Text prompts influence all these maps through the cross-attention mechanism, which guides the reverse dif- fusion process. The cross-attention maps are incorporated into the multi-scale feature maps and the output latent rep- resentation. The text guides the diffusion process and can accordingly shift the latent representation in semantic di- rections [1, 5, 16, 18]. The details of how VPD uses the prompting interface are described in Sec. 3. In short, VPD uses unaligned text prompts. In our work, we show how aligning the text to the image by using a captioner can sig- nificantly improve semantic segmentation and depth esti- mation performance. 2.2. Image captioning CLIP [31] introduced a novel learning paradigm to align images with their captions. Shortly after, the LAION-5B dataset [41] was released with 5B image-text pairs; this dataset was used to train Stable Diffusion. We hypothe- size that text-image alignment is important for diffusion- pretrained vision models. However, images used in ad- vanced vision tasks (like segmentation and depth estima- tion) are not naturally paired with text captions. To obtain image-aligned captions, we use BLIP-2 [25], a model that inverts the CLIP latent space to generate captions for novel images. 2.3. Diffusion models for cross-domain vision tasks A few works explore the cross-domain setting with diffu- sion models [2, 17]. Benigmim et al. [2] use a diffusion model to generate data for a downstream unsupervised do- main adaptation (UDA) architecture. In [17], the diffusion 2backbone is frozen, and the segmentation head is trained with a consistency loss with category and scene prompts guiding the latent code towards target cross-domains. Sim- ilar to VPD, the category prompts consist of token embed- dings for all classes present in the dataset, irrespective of their presence in any specific image. The consistency loss forces the model to predict the same output mask for all the different scene prompts, helping the segmentation head be- come invariant to the scene type. Instead of using a consis- tency loss, we train the diffusion model backbone and task head on the source domain data with and without incorpo- rating the style of the target domain in the caption. We find that better alignment with the target domain (i.e., target do- main information included in the prompt) results in better cross-domain performance. 2.4. Cross-domain object detection Cross-domain object detection can be divided into multi- ple subcategories, depending on what data / labels are at train / test time available. Unsupervised domain adaptation objection detection (UDAOD) tries to improve detection performance by training on unlabeled target domain data with approaches such as self-training [11, 44], adversarial distribution alignment [54] or generating pseudo labels for self-training [23]. Cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CDWSOD) assumes the availability of image- level annotations at training time and utilizes pseudo label- ing [21, 30], alignment [51] or correspondence mining [19]. Recently, [46] used CLIP [31] for Single Domain General- ization, which aims to generalize from a single domain to multiple unseen target domains. Our text-based method de- fines a new category of cross-domain object detection that tries to adapt from a single source to an unseen target do- main by only having the broad semantic context of the target domain (e.g., foggy/night/comic/watercolor) as text input to our method. When we incorporate model personalization, our method can be considered a UDAOD method since we train a token based on unlabeled images from the target do- main. 3. Methods Stable Diffusion [35]. The text-to-image Stable Diffusion model is composed of four networks: an encoderE, a condi- tional denoising autoencoder (a U-Net in Stable Diffusion) ϵθ, a language encoder τθ (the CLIP text encoder in Stable Diffusion), and a decoder D. E and D are trained before ϵθ, such that D(E(x)) = ˜x ≈ x. Training ϵθ is composed of a pre-defined forward process and a learned reverse pro- cess. The reverse process is learned using LAION-400M [40], a dataset of 400 million images (x ∈ X) and captions (y ∈ Y ). In the forward process, an image x is encoded into a latent z0 = E(x), and t steps of a forward noise pro- cess are executed to generate a noised latent zt. Then, to learn the reverse process, the latent zt is passed to the de- noising autoencoder ϵθ, along with the time-step t and the image caption’s representation C = τθ(y). τθ adds infor- mation about y to ϵθ using a cross-attention mechanism, in which the query is derived from the image, and the key and value are transformations of the caption representation. The model ϵθ is trained to predict the noise added to the latent in step t of the forward process: LLDM := EE(x),y,ϵ∼N(0,1),t h ∥ϵ−ϵθ(zt, t, τθ(y))∥2 2 i , (1) where t ∈ {0, ..., T}. During generation, a pure noise la- tent zT and a user-specified prompt are passed through the denoising autoencoder ϵθ for T steps and decoded D(z0) to generate an image guided by the text prompt. Diffusion for Feature Extraction. Diffusion backbones have been used for downstream vision tasks in several re- cent works [17, 28, 43, 53]. Due to its public availabil- ity and performance in perception tasks, we use a modi- fied version (see Sec. 4.1) of the feature extraction method in VPD. An image latent z0 = E(x) and a conditioning C are passed through the last step of the denoising process ϵθ(z0, 0, C). The cross-attention maps A and the multi-scale feature maps F of the U-Net are concatenated V = A ⊕ F and passed to a task-specific head H to generate a predic- tion ˆp = H(V ). The backbone ϵθ and head H are trained with a task-specific loss LH(ˆp, p). Average EOS Tokens. To generate C, previous meth- ods [17, 53] rely on a method from CLIP [31] to use aver- aged text embeddings as representations for the classes in a dataset. A list of 80 sentence templates for each class of in- terest (such as “a <adjective> photo of a <class name>”) are passed through the CLIP text encoder. We use B to de- note the set of class names in a dataset. For a specific class (b ∈ B), the CLIP text encoder returns an 80 × N × D tensor, where N is the maximum number of tokens over all the templates, and D is 768 (the dimension of each token embedding). Shorter sentences are padded with EOS to- kens to fill out the maximum number of tokens. The first EOS token from each sentence template is averaged and used as the representative embedding for the class such that C ∈ R|B|×768. This method is used in [17, 53], we denote it as Cavg and use it as a baseline. For semantic segmen- tation, all of the class embeddings, irrespective of presence in the image, are passed to the cross-attention layers. Only the class embedding of the room type is passed to the cross- attention layers for depth estimation. 3.1. Text-Aligned Diffusion Perception (TADP) Our work proposes a novel method for prompting diffusion- pretrained perception models. Specifically, we explore dif- ferent prompting methods G to generate C. In the single- domain setting, we show the effectiveness of a method 3Denoising U-Net Depth  Estimation Domain adaptation Text-image alignment  Text-domain alignment Multi-scale Feature Maps EOS class token [dog, bird, car, airplane, ...] BLIP “a photo of a dog and a parrot” Oracle “dog bird” Textual Inversion / DreamBooth “in a <token> style” simple “in a watercolor style” null “ ” Cross-attention CLIP Prompt Image  Encoder Task- speciﬁc Decoder Semantic Segmentation Object Detection LS Figure 2. Overview of TADP.We test several prompting strategies and evaluate their impact on downstream vision task performance. Our method concatenates the cross-attention and multi-scale feature maps before passing them to the vision-specific decoder. In the blue box, we show three single-domain captioning strategies with differing levels of text-image alignment. We propose using BLIP [25] captioning to improve image-text alignment. We extend our analysis to the cross-domain setting (yellow box), exploring whether aligning the source domain text captions to the target domain may impact model performance by appending caption modifiers to image captions generated in the source domain and find model personalization modifiers (Textual Inversion/Dreambooth) work best. that uses BLIP-2 [25], an image captioning algorithm, to generate a caption as the conditioning for the model: G(x) = ˜y → C. We then extend our method to the cross- domain setting by incorporating target domain information to C = C + M(P)s, where M is a caption modifier that takes target domain information P as input and outputs a caption modification M(P)s and a model modification M(P)ϵθ . In Sec. 4, we analyze the text-image interface of the diffusion model by varying the captioner G and cap- tion modifier M in a systematic manner for three differ- ent vision tasks: semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation. Our method and experi- ments are presented in Fig. 2. Following [53], we train our ADE20k segmentation and NYUv2 depth estimation mod- els with fast and regular schedules. On ADE20k, we train using 4k steps (fast), 8k steps (fast), and 80k steps (normal). For NYUv2 depth, we train on a 1-epoch (fast) schedule and a 25-epoch (normal) schedule. For implementation details, refer to Appendix D. 4. Results 4.1. Latent scaling Before exploring image-text alignment, we apply latent scaling to encoded images (Appendix G of Rombach et al. [35]). This normalizes the image latents to have a standard normal distribution. The scaling factor is fixed at 0.18215. We find that latent scaling improves performance usingCavg for segmentation and depth estimation (Fig. 3). Specifically, latent scaling improves ∼0.8% mIoU on Pascal, ∼0.3% mIoU on ADE20K, and a relative∼5.5% RMSE on NYUv2 Depth (Fig. 3).

We scrutinize the use of average EOS tokens for C (see Sec. 3). While average EOS tokens are sensible when measuring cosine similarities in the CLIP latent space, it is unsuitable in diffusion models, where the text guides the diffusion process through cross-attention. In our qualitative analysis, we find that average EOS tokens degrade the cross-attention maps (Fig. 4). Instead, we ex- plore using CLIP to embed each class name independently and use the tokens corresponding to the actual word (not the EOS token) and pass this as input to the cross-attention layer: GClassEmbs(B) =concat(CLIP(b)|b ∈ B) → CClassEmbs (2) 4no LS w/LS80.0 82.5 85.0 Pascal VOC2012  mIoU % ( ) no LS w/LS50.0 52.5 55.0 ADE20K  mIoU % ( ) no LS w/LS0.20 0.25 0.30 NYUv2  RMSE ( ) 0 20 4086 87 88 0 20 40 BLIP min words 54.0 54.5 55.0 0 20 400.220 0.225 0.230 Figure 3. Effects of Latent Scaling (LS) and BLIP caption min- imum length. We report mIoU for Pascal, mIoU for ADE20K, and RMSE for NYUv2 depth (right). (Top) Latent scaling im- proves performance on Pascal ∼0.8 mIoU (higher is better), ∼0.3 mIoU, and ∼5.5% relative RMSE (lower is better). (Bottom) We see a similar effect for BLIP minimum token length, with longer captions performing better, improving ∼0.8 mIoU on Pas- cal, ∼0.9 mIoU on ADE20K, and ∼0.6% relative RMSE. Second, we explore a generic prompt, a string of class names separated by spaces: GClassNames(B) ={‘ ’ + b|b ∈ B} → CClassNames (3) These prompts are similar to the ones used for averaged EOS tokens Cavg w.r.t. overall text-image alignment but instead use the token corresponding to the word represent- ing the class name. We evaluate these variations on Pascal VOC2012 segmentation. We find that CClassNames improves performance by 1.0 mIoU, but CClassEmbs reduces perfor- mance by 0.3 mIoU (see Tab. 1). We perform more in-depth analyses of the effect of text-image alignment on the dif- fusion model’s cross-attention maps and image generation properties in Appendix A. TADP. To align the diffusion model text input to the im- age, we use BLIP-2 [25] to generate captions for every im- age in our single-domain datasets (Pascal, ADE20K, and NYUv2). GTADP(x) =BLIP-2(x) → CTADP(x) (4) BLIP-2 is trained to produce image-aligned text captions and is designed around the CLIP latent space. How- ever, other vision-language algorithms that produce cap- tions could also be used. We find that these text captions improve performance in all datasets and tasks (Tabs. 1, 2, 3). Performance improves on Pascal segmentation by ∼4% mIoU, ADE20K by ∼1.4% mIoU, and NYUv2 Depth by a relative RMSE improvement of 4%. We see stronger effects on the fast schedules for ADE20K with an improvement of ∼5 mIoU at (4k), ∼2.4 mIoU (8K). On NYUv2 Depth, we see a smaller gain on the fast schedule∼2.4%. All numbers are reported relative to VPD with latent scaling.

A minimum caption length of 40 tokens performs the best.We also explore adding a text-adapter (TA) to TADP, but find no significant gain. See Table 1 for a notation key. We perform some ablations to analyze what aspects of the captions are important. We explore the minimum token number hyperparameter for BLIP-2 to explore if longer cap- tions can produce more useful feature maps for the down- stream task. We try a minimum token number of 0, 20, and 40 tokens (denoted as CTADP-N) and find small but consis- tent gains with longer captions, resulting on average 0.75% relative gain for 40 tokens vs. 0 tokens (Fig. 3).

We compare the cross-attention maps for four types of prompting: oracle, BLIP, Average EOS tokens, and class names as space-separated strings. The cross-attention maps for different heads at all different scales are upsampled to 64x64 and averaged. When comparing Average Template EOS and Class Names, we see (qualitatively) averaging degrades the quality of the cross-attention maps. Furthermore, we find that class names that are not present in the image can have highly localized attention maps (e.g., ‘bottle’). Further analysis of the cross-attention maps is available in Sec. A, where we explore image-to-image generation, copy-paste image modifications, and more. caption is necessary for the performance gains we observe. We use NLTK [4] to filter for the nouns in the captions. In the CTADP(NO)-20 nouns-only caption setting, we achieve 86.4% mIoU, similar to 86.2% mIoU withCTADP-20 (Tab. 1), suggesting nouns are sufficient. Oracle. This insight about nouns leads us to ask if an oracle caption, in which all the object class names in an image are provided as a caption, can improve performance further. We define B(x) as the set of class names present in image x. GOracle(x) ={‘ ’ + b|b ∈ B(x)} → COracle(x) (5) While this is not a realistic setting, it serves as an approx- imate upper bound on performance for our method on the segmentation task. We find a large improvement in per- formance in segmentation, achieving 89% mIoU on Pascal and 72.2% mIoU on ADE20K. For depth estimation, multi- class segmentation masks are only provided for a smaller subset of the images, so we cannot generate a comparable oracle. We perform ablations on the oracle captions to eval- uate the model’s sensitivity to alignment. For ADE20K, on the 4k iteration schedule, we modify the oracle captions by randomly adding and removing classes such that the re- call and precision are at 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (independently) (Tab. S2). We find that both precision and recall have an effect, but recall is significantly more important. When re- call is lower (0.50), improving precision has minimal im- pact ( <1% mIoU). However, precision has progressively larger impacts as recall increases to 0.75 and 1.00 ( ∼3% mIoU and ∼7% mIoU). In contrast, recall has large impacts at every precision level: 0.5 - ( ∼6% mIoU), 0.75 - ( ∼9% mIoU), and 1.00 - ( ∼13% mIoU). BLIP-2 captioning per- forms similarly to a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.5 (Tab. 2). Additional analyses w.r.t. precision, recall, and object sizes can be found in Appendix B. 4.3. Cross-domain alignment Next, we ask if text-image alignment can benefit cross- domain tasks. In cross-domain, we train a model on a source domain and test it on a different target domain. There are two aspects of alignment in the cross-domain setting: the first is also present in single-domain, which is image- text alignment; the second is unique to the cross-domain setting, which is text-target domain alignment.

Our method sets a new SOTA for DarkZurich and Nighttime Driving. is challenging because there is a large domain shift between the source and target domain. Our intuition is that while the model has no information on the target domain from the training images, an appropriate text prompt may carry some general information about the target domain. Our cross- domain experiments focus on the text-target domain align- ment and useGTADP for image-text alignment (following our insights from the single-domain setting). Training. Our experiments in this setting are designed in the following manner: we train a diffusion model on the source domain captions CTADP(x). With these source domain captions, we experiment with four different cap- tion modifications (each increasing in alignment to the tar- get domain), a null Mnull(P) caption modification where Mnull(P)s = ∅ = Mnull(P)ϵθ = ∅, a simple Msimple(P) caption modifier whereMsimple(P)s is a hand-crafted string describing the style of the target domain appended to the end and Msimple(P)ϵθ = ∅, a Textual Inversion [16] MTI(P) caption modifier where the output MTI(P)s is a learned Textual Inversion token <*> and MTI(P)ϵθ = ∅, and a DreamBooth [37] MDB(P) caption modifier where MDB(P)s is a learned DreamBooth token <SKS> and MDB(P)ϵθ is a DreamBoothed diffusion backbone. We also include two additional control experiments. In the first, Mud(P) an unrelated target domain style is appended to the end of the string. In the second, Mnd(P) a nearby but a different target domain style is appended to the caption. MTI(P) and MDB(P) require more information than the other methods, such thatP represents a subset of unlabelled images from the target domain. Testing. When testing the trained models on the tar- get domain images, we want to use the same caption- ing modification for the test images as in the training setup.

For example, GTADP(x) might produce the caption “a watercolor paint- ing of a dog and a bird” for an image from the Water- color2K dataset. Using the Msimple(P) captioning modi- fication on this prompt would introduce redundant informa- tion and would not match the caption format used during training. In order to remove target domain information and get a plain caption that can be modified in the same man- ner as in the training data, we use GPT-3.5 [6] to remove all mentions of the target domain shift. For example, after using GPT-3.5 to remove mentions of the watercolor style in the above sentence, we are left with “an image of a bird and a dog”. With these GPT-3.5 cleaned captions, we can match the caption modifications used during training when evaluating test images. This caption-cleaning strategy lets us control how target domain information is included in the test image captions, ensuring that test captions are in the same domain as train captions. Evaluation. We evaluate cross-domain transfer on sev- eral datasets. We train our model on Pascal VOC [13, 14] object detection and evaluate on Watercolor2K (W2K) [21] and Comic2K (C2K) [21]. We also train our model on the Cityscapes [9] dataset and evaluate on the Nighttime Driv- ing (ND) [10] and Dark Zurich-val (DZ-val) [39] datasets. We show results in Tabs. 4, 5. In the following sections, we also report the average performance of each method on the cross-domain segmentation datasets (average mIoU) and the cross-domain object detection datasets (average AP). 7Null caption modifier. The null captions have no tar- get domain information. In this setting, the model is trained with captions with no target domain information and tested with GPT-3.5 cleaned target domain captions. We find diffusion pre-training to be extraordinarily powerful on its own, with just plain captions (no target domain informa- tion); the model already achieves SOTA on VOC →W2K with 72.1 AP50, SOTA on CD →DZ-val with 42.8 mIoU and SOTA on CD →ND with 60.8 mIoU. Our model per- forms better than the current SOTA [44] on VOC →W2K and worse on VOC→C2K (highlighted in yellow in Tab. 5). However, [44] uses a large extra training dataset from the target (comic) domain, so we highlight in bold our results in Tab. 5 to show they outperform all other methods that use only images in C2K as examples from the target do- main. Furthermore, these results are with a lightweight FPN [24] head, in contrast to other competitive methods like Re- fign [7], which uses a heavier decoder head. These captions achieve 50.5 average mIoU and 36.6 average AP. Simple caption modifier. We then add target domain in- formation to our captions by prepending the target domain’s semantic shift to the generic captions. These caption modi- fiers are hand-crafted. For example, “a dog and a bird” be- comes “a X style painting of a dog and a bird” (where X is watercolor for W2K and comic for C2K) and “a dark night photo of a dog and a bird” for DZ. These captions achieve 48.0 average mIoU and 37.7 average AP. Textual Inversion caption modifier. Textual inversion [16] is a method that learns a target concept (an object or style) from a set of images and encodes it into a new to- ken. We learn a novel token from target domain image sam- ples to further increase image-text alignment (for details, see Sec. D.1). In this setting, the sentence template be- comes “a <token> style painting of a dog and a bird”. We find that, on average, Textual Inversion captions perform the best, achieving 51.1 average mIoU and 38.2 average AP. DreamBooth caption modifier. DreamBooth-ing [37] aims to achieve the same goal as textual inversion. Along with learning a new token, the stable-diffusion backbone it- self is fine-tuned with a set of target domain images (for de- tails, see Sec. D.1). We swap the stable diffusion backbone with the DreamBooth-ed backbone before training. We use the same template as in textual inversion. These captions achieve 49.7 average mIoU and 38.1 average AP. Ablations. We ablate our target domain alignment strat- egy by introducing unrelated and nearby target-domain style modifications. For example, this would be “a dash- cam photo of a dog and a bird” (unrelated) and “aconstruc- tivism painting of a dog and a bird” (nearby) for the W2K and C2K datasets. “A watercolor painting of a car on the street” (unrelated) and “a foggy photo of a car on the street” for the ND and DZ-val datasets. We find these off-target domains reduce performance on all datasets. 5. Discussion We present a method for image-text alignment that is gen- eral, fully automated, and can be applied to any diffusion- based perception model. To achieve this, we systematically explore the impact of text-image alignment on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection. We investigate whether similar principles apply in the cross- domain setting and find that alignment towards the target domain during training improves downstream cross-domain performance. We find that EOS token averaging for prompting does not work as effectively as strings for the objects in the im- age. Our oracle ablation experiments show that our diffu- sion pre-trained segmentation model is particularly sensi- tive to missing classes (reduced recall) and less sensitive to off-target classes (reduced precision), and both have a neg- ative impact. Our results show that aligning text prompts to the image is important in identifying/generating good multi- scale feature maps for the downstream segmentation head. This implies that the multi-scale features and latent repre- sentations do not naturally identify semantic concepts with- out the guidance of the text in diffusion models. Moreover, proper latent scaling is crucial for downstream vision tasks. Lastly, we show how using a captioner, which has the ben- efit of being open vocabulary, high precision, and down- stream task agnostic, to prompt the diffusion pre-trained segmentation model automatically improves performance significantly over providing all possible class names. We also find that diffusion models can be used effec- tively for cross-domain tasks. Our model, without any captions, already surpasses several SOTA results in cross- domain tasks due to the diffusion backbone’s generaliz- ability. We find that good target domain alignment can help with cross-domain performance for some domains, and misalignment leads to worse performance. Capturing in- formation about target domain styles in words alone can be difficult. For these cases, we show that model per- sonalization through Textual Inversion or Dreambooth can bridge the gap without requiring labeled data. Future work could explore how to expand our framework to generalize to multiple unseen domains. Future work may also explore closed vocabulary captioners that are more task-specific to get closer to oracle-level performance. Acknowledgements.

Cross-attention analysis Qualitative image-to-image variation analysis. We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the effect of off-target class names added to the prompt. In Fig. S1, we use the stable diffusion image to image (img2img) variation pipeline (with the original Stable Diffusion 1.5 weights) to qualitatively analyze the effects of prompts with off-target classes. The img2img variation pipeline encodes a real image into a latent representation, adds a user-specified amount of noise to the latent representation, and de-noises it (according to a user-specified prompt) to generate a variation on the original image. The amount of noise added is dictated by a strength ratio indicating how much variation should occur. A higher ratio results in more added noise and more denoising steps, allowing a relatively higher impact of the new text prompt on the image. We find that CClassNames (see caption for details) results in variations that incorporate the off-target classes. This effect is most clear looking across the panels left to right in which objects belonging to off-target classes (an airplane and a train) become more prominent. These qualitative results imply that this prompt modifies the latent representation to incorporate information about off-target classes, potentially making the downstream task more difficult. In contrast, using the BLIP prompt changes the image, but the semantics (position of objects, classes present) of the image variation are significantly closer to the original. These results suggest a mechanism for how off-target classes may impact our vision models. We quantitatively measure this effect using a fully trained Oracle model in the following section. Copy-Paste Experiment. An interesting property in Fig. 4 is that the word bottle has strong cross-attention over the neck of the bird. We hypothesize that diffusion models seek to find the nearest match for each token since they are trained to generate images that correspond to the prompt. We test this hypothesis on a base image of a dog and a bird. We first visualize the cross-attention maps for a set of object labels. We find that the words bottle, cat, and horse have a strong cross-attention to the bird, dog, and dog, respectively. We paste a bottle, cat, and horse into the base image to see if the diffusion model will localize the “correct” objects if they are present. In Fig. S2, we show that the cross-attention maps prefer to localize the “correct” object, suggesting our hypothesis is correct. Averaged EOS Tokens: Averaging vs. EOS? Averaged EOS Tokens create diffuse attention maps that empirically harm performance. What is the actual cause of the decrease in performance? Is it averaging, or is it the usage of many EOS tokens? We replace the averaged EOS tokens with single prompt EOS tokens and find that the attention maps are still diffuse. This indicates that the usage of EOS tokens is the primary cause of the diffuse attention maps and not the averaging. Quantitative effect of CClassNames on Oracle model. To quantify the impact of the off-target classes on the downstream vision task, we measure the averaged pixel-wise scores (normalized via Softmax) per class when passing the CClassNames to the Oracle segmentation model for Pascal VOC 2012 (Fig. S4). We compare this to the original oracle prompt. We find that including the off-target prompts significantly increases the probability of a pixel being misclassified as one of the semantically nearby off-target classes. For example, if the original image contains a cow, including the words dog and sheep, it significantly raises the probability of misclassifying the pixels belonging to the cow as pixels belonging to a dog or a sheep. These results indicate that the task-specific head picks up the effect of off-target classes and is incorporated into the output. 15 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Class   Names BLIP De-noising steps Figure S1.

Averaging vs. EOS. In [53], for each class name, the EOS token from 80 prompts (containing the class name) was averaged together. The averaged EOS tokens for each class were concatenated together and passed to the diffusion model as text input. We explore if averaging drives the diffuse nature of the cross-attention maps. We replace the 80 prompt templates with a single prompt template: “a photo of a {class name}” and visualize the cross-attention maps. In the top row, we show the averaged template EOS tokens. In the bottom row, we show the single template EOS tokens. airplanebicycle birdboatbottle buscar catchaircow dining table doghorse motorcycle person potted plant sheepsofatrain television Activation airplane bicycle bird boat bottle bus car cat chair cow dining table dog horse motorcycle person potted plant sheep sofa train television T arget 0.93 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.76 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.87 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.88 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.94 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.94 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.75 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.90 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.80 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.90 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.90 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.88 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.89 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.70 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.92 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.80 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.91 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.80 airplanebicycle birdboatbottle buscar catchaircow dining table doghorse motorcycle person potted plant sheepsofatrain television Activation airplane bicycle bird boat bottle bus car cat chair cow dining table dog horse motorcycle person potted plant sheep sofa train television T arget 0.85 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.61 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.40 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.01 0.15 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.10 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.06 0.03 0.02 0.49 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.07 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.72 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.65 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.68 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.17 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.59 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.64 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.03 0.22 0.02 0.17 0.21 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.65 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.79 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.09 0.01 0.08 0.53 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.04 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.62 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.86 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.05 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.42 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.03 0.15 0.02 0.21 0.09 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.22 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.16 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.51 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.07 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.65 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.76 Figure S4.

Implementation Details To isolate the effects of our text-image alignment method, we ensure our model setup precisely follows prior work. Following VPD [53], we jointly train the task-specific head and the diffusion backbone. The learning rate of the backbone is set to 1/10 the learning rate of the head to preserve the benefits of pre-training better. We describe the different tasks by describing H and LH. We use an FPN [24] head with a cross-entropy loss for segmentation. We use the same convolutional head used in VPD for monocular depth estimation with a Scale-Invariant loss [12]. For object detection, we use a Faster-RCNN head with the standard Faster-RCNN loss [34] 1. Further details of the training setup can be found in Tab. S3 and Tab. S4. In our single-domain tables, we include our reproduction of VPD, denoted with a (R). We compute our relative gains with our reproduced numbers, with the same seed for all experiments.

      "title": "DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models for Adversarial Robustness",
      "abstract": "Diffusion models have been recently employed to improve certified robustness\nthrough the process of denoising. However, the theoretical understanding of why\ndiffusion models are able to improve the certified robustness is still lacking,\npreventing from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by\nanalyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the\nconditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper\nunderstanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve\nthe certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an\n(adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the\nreverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get\nmultiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier,\nfollowed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction.\nThis design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical\nanalysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically,\nwhen the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under\nthe reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the\nlatter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return\nthe corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest\ndensity point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we\nidentify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's\nreverse process.

However, the theoretical understanding of why diffusion models are able to improve the certiﬁed robustness is still lacking, pre- venting from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by analyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the conditions under which they can enhance certiﬁed robustness. This deeper understanding al- lows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve the certiﬁed robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classiﬁer). Given an (adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the reverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get multiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classiﬁer, followed by majority voting of in- ferred labels to make the ﬁnal prediction. This design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical analysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Speciﬁcally, when the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under the reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the latter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return the corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sam- ple, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model’s reverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex sets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identiﬁed in previous works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certiﬁed robustness. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness ofDensePure by evaluat- ing its certiﬁed robustness given a standard model via randomized smoothing. We show that DensePure is consistently better than existing methods on ImageNet, with 7% improvement on average. 1 I NTRODUCTION Diffusion models have been shown to be a powerful image generation tool (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021b) owing to their iterative diffusion and denoising processes. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on sample quality (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021; Vahdat et al., 2021) as well as effective mode coverage (Song et al., 2021a). A diffusion model usually consists of two processes: (i) a forward diffusion process that converts data to noise by gradually adding noise to the input, and (ii) a reverse generative process that starts from noise and generates data by denoising one step at a time (Song et al., 2021b). Given the natural denoising property of diffusion models, empirical studies have leveraged them to perform adversarial puriﬁcation (Nie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Carlini et al., 2022). For instance, Nie et al. (2022) introduce a diffusion model based puriﬁcation model DiffPure. They empirically show that by carefully choosing the amount of Gaussian noises added during the diffusion process, adversarial perturbations can be removed while preserving the true label semantics. Despite the signiﬁcant empirical results, there is no provable guarantee of the achieved robustness. Carlini et al. ∗the ﬁrst four authors contributed equally 1 arXiv:2211.00322v1  [cs.LG]  1 Nov 2022DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness (2022) instantiate the randomized smoothing approach with the diffusion model to offer a provable guarantee of model robustness against L2-norm bounded adversarial example. However, they do not provide a theoretical understanding of why and how the diffusion models contribute to such nontrivial certiﬁed robustness. Our Approach. We theoretically analyze the fundamental properties of diffusion models to under- stand why and how it enhances certiﬁed robustness. This deeper understanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure to improve the certiﬁed robustness of any given classiﬁer by more effec- tively using the diffusion model. An illustration of theDensePure framework is provided in Figure 1, where it consists of a pretrained diffusion model and a pretrained classiﬁer. DensePure in- corporates two steps: (i) using the reverse process of the diffusion model to obtain a sample of the posterior data distribution conditioned on the adversarial input; and (ii) repeating the reverse process multiple times with different random seeds to approximate the label of high density region in the conditional distribution via a majority vote. In particular, given an adversarial input, we repeatedly feed it into the reverse process of the diffusion model to get multiple reversed examples and feed them into the classiﬁer to get their labels. We then apply the majority vote on the set of labels to get the ﬁnal predicted label. DensePure is inspired by our theoretical analysis, where we show that the diffusion model reverse process provides a conditional distribution of the reversed sample given an adversarial input, and sampling from this conditional distribution enhances the certiﬁed robustness. Speciﬁcally, we prove that when the data density of clean samples is high, it is a sufﬁcient condition for the conditional density of the reversed samples to be also high. Therefore, in DensePure, samples from the condi- tional distribution can recover the ground-truth labels with a high probability. For the convenience of understanding and rigorous analysis, we use the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the deterministic reversed sample for the classiﬁer prediction. We show that the robust region for a given sample under the diffusion model’s reverse process is the union of multiple convex sets, each surrounding a region around the ground-truth label. Compared with the robust region of previous work (Cohen et al., 2019), which only focuses on the neighborhood ofone region with the ground-truth label, such union of multiple convex sets has the potential to provide a much larger robust region. Moreover, the characterization implies that the size of robust regions is affected by the relative density and the distance between data regions with the ground-truth label and those with other labels. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets under different settings to evaluate the certiﬁable robustness of DensePure. In particular, we follow the setting from Carlini et al. (2022) and rely on randomized smoothing to certify robustness to adversarial perturbations bounded in the L2-norm. We show that DensePure achieves the new state-of-the-art certiﬁed robustness on the clean model without tuning any model parameters (off-the-shelf). On ImageNet, it achieves a consistently higher certiﬁed accuracy than the existing methods among everyσat every radius ϵ, 7% improvement on average. Figure 1: Pipeline of DensePure. Technical Contributions. In this paper, we take the ﬁrst step towards understanding the sufﬁcient conditions of adversarial puriﬁcation with diffusion models. We make contributions on both theo- retical and empirical fronts: (1) We prove that under constrained data density property, an adversarial example can be recovered back to the original clean sample with high probability via the reverse pro- cess of a diffusion model. (2) In theory, we characterized the robust region for each point by further taking the highest density point in the conditional distribution generated by the reverse process as the reversed sample. (3) In practice, we proposed DensePure, which is a state-of-art adversarial puriﬁcation pipeline directly leveraging the reverse process of a pre-trained diffusion model and la- 2DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness bel majority vote. (4) We demonstrated comparable performance of DensePure on CIFAR-10 and state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet. 2 P RELIMINARIES AND BACKGROUNDS Continuous-Time Diffusion Model. The diffusion model has two components: the diffusion pro- cess followed by the reverse process. Given an input random variable x0 ∼p, the diffusion pro- cess adds isotropic Gaussian noises to the data so that the diffused random variable at time t is xt = √αt(x0 + ϵt), s.t., ϵt ∼N(0,σ2 tI), and σ2 t = (1 −αt)/αt, and we denote xt ∼pt. The forward diffusion process can also be deﬁned by the stochastic differential equation dx= h(x,t)dt+ g(t)dw, (SDE) where x0 ∼p, h : Rd ×R ↦→Rd is the drift coefﬁcient, g : R ↦→R is the diffusion coefﬁcient, and w(t) ∈Rn is the standard Wiener process. Under mild conditions B.1, the reverse process exists and removes the added noise by solving the reverse-time SDE (Anderson, 1982) dˆx= [h(ˆx,t) −g(t)2▽ˆxlog pt(ˆx)]dt+ g(t)dw, (reverse-SDE) where dtis an inﬁnitesimal reverse time step, and w(t) is a reverse-time standard Wiener process. In our context, we use the conventions of VP-SDE (Song et al., 2021b) where h(x; t) := −1 2 γ(t)x and g(t) := √ γ(t) with γ(t) positive and continuous over [0,1], such that x(t) = √αtx(0) +√1 −αtϵwhere αt = e− ∫ t 0 γ(s)ds and ϵ∼N(0,I). We use {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] to denote the diffusion process and the reverse process generated by SDE and reverse-SDE respectively, which follow the same distribution. Discrete-Time Diffusion Model (or DDPM (Ho et al., 2020)). DDPM constructs a discrete Markov chain {x0,x1,··· ,xi,··· ,xN}as the forward process for the training data x0 ∼p, such that P(xi|xi−1) = N(xi; √1 −βixi−1,βiI), where 0 <β1 <β2 <··· <βN <1 are predeﬁned noise scales such that xN approximates the Gaussian white noise. Denote αi = ∏N i=1(1 −βi), we have P(xi|x0) = N(xi; √αix0,(1 −αi)I), i.e., xt(x0,ϵ) = √αix0 + (1 −αi)ϵ,ϵ∼N(0,I). The reverse process of DDPM learns a reverse direction variational Markov chain pθ(xi−1|xi) = N(xi−1; µθ(xi,i),Σθ(xi,i)). Ho et al. (2020) deﬁnes ϵθ as a function approximator to predict ϵfrom xi such that µθ(xi,i) = 1√1−βi ( xi − βi√1−αi ϵθ(xi,i) ) . Then the reverse time samples are generated by ˆxi−1 = 1√1−βi ( ˆxi − βi√1−αi ϵθ∗(ˆxi,i) ) + √βiϵ,ϵ ∼N (000,I), and the optimal parameters θ∗are obtained by solving θ∗:= arg minθEx0,ϵ [ ||ϵ−ϵθ(√αix0 + (1 −αi),i)||2 2 ] . Randomized Smoothing. Randomized smoothing is used to certify the robustness of a given classiﬁer against L2-norm based perturbation. It transfers the classiﬁer f to a smooth version g(x) = arg maxcPϵ∼N(0,σ2I)(f(x+ ϵ) = c), where g is the smooth classiﬁer and σ is a hyper- parameter of the smooth classiﬁer g, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Cohen et al. (2019) shows that g(x) induces the certiﬁable robustness for xunder the L2-norm with radius R, where R = σ 2 ( Φ−1(pA) −Φ−1(pB) ) ; pA and pB are probability of the most probable class and “runner-up” class respectively;Φ is the inverse of the standard Gaussian CDF. ThepA and pB can be estimated with arbitrarily high conﬁdence via Monte Carlo method (Cohen et al., 2019). 3 T HEORETICAL ANALYSIS In this section, we theoretically analyze why and how the diffusion model can enhance the robustness of a given classiﬁer. We will analyze directly on SDE and reverse-SDE as they generate the same stochastic processes {xt}t∈[0,T] and the literature works establish an approximation on reverse- SDE (Song et al., 2021b; Ho et al., 2020). We ﬁrst show that given a diffusion model, solving reverse-SDE will generate a conditional distribu- tion based on the scaled adversarial sample, which will have high density on data region with high data density and near to the adversarial sample in Theorem 3.1. See detailed conditions in B.1. 3DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Theorem 3.1. Under conditions B.1, solving equation reverse-SDE starting from timetand sample xa,t = √αtxa will generate a reversed random variable ˆx0 with density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) ∝ p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)n exp ( −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t ) , where pis the data distribution, σ2 t = 1−αt αt is the variance of Gaussian noise added at time tin the diffusion process. Proof. (sketch) Under conditions B.1, we know {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] follow the same distri- bution, and then the rest proof follows Bayes’ Rule. Please see the full proofs of this and the following theorems in Appendix B.2. Remark 1. Note that P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) >0 if and only if p(x) >0, thus the generated reverse sample will be on the data region where we train classiﬁers. In Theorem 3.1, the conditional density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) is high only if both p(x) and the Gaussian term have high values, i.e., xhas high data density and is close to the adversarial sample xa. The latter condition is reasonable since adversarial perturbations are typically bounded due to budget constraints. Then, the above argument implies that a reversed sample will have the ground- truth label with a high probability if data region with the ground-truth label has high enough data density. For the convenience of theoretical analysis and understanding, we take the point with high- est conditional density P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) as the reversed sample, deﬁned as P(xa; t) := arg maxxP(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t). P(xa; t) is a representative of the high density data region in the conditional distribution and P(·; t) is a deterministic puriﬁcation model. In the following, we characterize the robust region for data region with ground-truth label under P(·; t). The robust re- gion and the robust radius for a general deterministic puriﬁcation model given a classiﬁer are deﬁned below. Deﬁnition 3.2 (Robust Region and Robust Radius) . Given a classiﬁer f and a point x0, let G(x0) := {x : f(x) = f(x0)}be the data region where samples have the same label as x0. Then given a deterministic puriﬁcation model P(·; ψ) with parameter ψ, we deﬁne the robust re- gion of G(x0) under Pand f as Df P(G(x0); ψ) := {x: f(P(x; ψ)) = f(x0)}, i.e., the set of x such that puriﬁed sample P(x; ψ) has the same label as x0 under f. Further, we deﬁne the robust radius of x0 as rf P(x0; ψ) := max { r: x0 + ru∈Df P(x0; ψ) , ∀||u||2 ≤1 } , i.e., the radius of maximum inclined ball of Df P(x0; ψ) centered around x0. We will omit Pand f when it is clear from the context and write D(G(x0); ψ) and r(x0; ψ) instead. Remark 2. In Deﬁnition 3.2, the robust region (resp. radius) is deﬁned for each class (resp. point). When using the point with highest P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) as the reversed sample, ψ:= t. Now given a sample x0 with ground-truth label, we are ready to characterize the robust region D(G(x0); ψ) under puriﬁcation model P(·; t) and classiﬁer f. Intuitively, if the adversarial sample xa is near to x0 (in Euclidean distance), xa keeps the same label semantics of x0 and so as the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t), which implies that f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0). However, the condition that xa is near to x0 is sufﬁcient but not necessary since we can still achieve f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0) if xa is near to any sample ˜x0 with f(P(˜xa; ψ)) = f(x0). In the following, we will show that the robust region D(G(x0); ψ) is the union of the convex robust sub-regions surrounding every ˜x0 with the same label as x0. The following theorem characterizes the convex robust sub-region and robust region respectively. Theorem 3.3. Under conditions B.1 and classiﬁer f, let x0 be the sample with ground-truth label and xa be the adversarial sample, then (i) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if xa falls into the following convex set, Dsub (x0; t) := ⋂ {x′ 0:f(x′ 0)̸=f(x0)} { xa : (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + ||x′ 0 −x0||2 2 2 } , and further, (ii) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if and only if xa falls into the following set, D(G(x0); t) := ⋃ ˜x0:f(˜x0)=f(x0) Dsub (˜x0; t). In other words, D(G(x0); t) is the robust region for data regionG(x0) under P(·; t) and f. 4DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Proof. (sketch) (i). Each convex half-space deﬁned by the inequality corresponds to a x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0) where xa within satisﬁes P(ˆx0 = x0|ˆxt = xa,t) >P(ˆx0 = x′ 0 |ˆxt = xxxa,t). This implies that P(xa; t) ̸= x′ 0 and f(P(xa; ψ)) = f(x0). The convexity is due to that the intersection of convex sets is convex. (ii). The “if” follows directly from (i). The “only if” holds because if xa /∈ D(G(x0); t), then exists ˜x1 such that f(˜x1) ̸= f(x0) and P(ˆx0 = ˜x1|ˆxt = xa,t) > P(ˆx0 = ˜x0|ˆxt = xa,t) ,∀˜x0 s.t. f(˜x0) = f(x0), and thus f(P(xa; ψ)) ̸= f(x0). Remark 3. Theorem 3.3 implies that when data region G(x0) has higher data density and larger distances to data regions with other labels, it tends to have larger robust region and points in data region tends to have larger radius. In the literature, people focus more on the robust radius (lower bound) r(G(x0); t) (Cohen et al., 2019; Carlini et al., 2022), which can be obtained by ﬁnding the maximum inclined ball inside D(G(x0); t) centering x0. Note that although Dsub (x0; t) is convex, D(G(x0); t) is generally not. Therefore, ﬁnding r(G(x0); t) is a non-convex optimization problem. In particular, it can be formulated into a disjunctive optimization problem with integer indicator variables, which is typi- cally NP-hard to solve. One alternative could be ﬁnding the maximum inclined ball in Dsub (x0; t), which can be formulated into a convex optimization problem whose optimal value provides a lower bound for r(G(x0); t). However, D(G(x0); t) has the potential to provide much larger robustness radius because it might connect different convex robust sub-regions into one, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: An illustration of the robust region D(x0; t) = ⋃3 i=1 Dsub(xi; t), where x0,x1,x2 are samples with ground-truth label andx3 is a sample with another label.xa = x0+ϵais an adversarial sample such that P(xa; t) = x1 ̸= x0 and thus the classiﬁcation is correct but xa is not reversed back to x0. rsub(x0) <r(x0) shows our claim that the union leads to a larger robust radius. In practice, we cannot guarantee to establish an exact reverse process like reverse-SDE but instead try to establish an approximate reverse process to mimic the exact one. As long as the approximate reverse process is close enough to the exact reverse process, they will generate close enough con- ditional distributions based on the adversarial sample. Then the density and locations of the data regions in two conditional distributions will not differ much and so is the robust region for each data region. We take the score-based diffusion model in Song et al. (2021b) for an example and demonstrate Theorem 3.4 to bound the KL-divergnece between conditional distributions generated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model. Ho et al. (2020) showed that using variational inference to ﬁt DDPM is equivalent to optimizing an objective resembling score-based diffusion model with a speciﬁc weighting scheme, so the results can be extended to DDPM. Theorem 3.4. Under score-based diffusion model Song et al. (2021b) and conditions B.1, we have DKL(P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t)) = JSM(θ,t; λ(·)), where {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] are stochastic processes generated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model respectively, JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) := 1 2 ∫t 0 Epτ(x) [ λ(τ) ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ,sθ(x,τ) is the score function to approximate ∇x log pτ(x), and λ : R →R is any weighting scheme used in the training score-based diffusion models. Proof. (sketch) Let µtand νtbe the path measure for reverse processes{ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] respectively based on the xa,t. Under conditions B.1, µt and νt are uniquely deﬁned and the KL- divergence can be computed via the Girsanov theorem Oksendal (2013). 5DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Remark 4. Theorem 3.4 shows that if the training loss is smaller, the conditional distributions gen- erated by reverse-SDE and score-based diffusion model are closer, and are the same if the training loss is zero. 4 DENSE PURE Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we introduceDensePure and show how to calculate its certiﬁed robustness radius via the randomized smoothing algorithm. Framework. Our framework, DensePure, consists of two components: (1) an off-the-shelf diffu- sion model with reverse process rev and (2) an off-the-shelf base classiﬁer f. The pipeline of DensePure is shown in Figure 1. Given an input x, we feed it into the reverse pro- cess rev of the diffusion model to get the reversed samplerev(x) and then repeat the above process K times to get K reversed samples {rev(x)1,··· ,rev(x)K}. We feed the above K reversed samples into the classiﬁer to get the corresponding prediction {f(rev(x)1),··· ,f(rev(x)K)} and then apply the majority vote, termed MV, on these predictions to get the ﬁnal predicted la- bel ˆy= MV({f(rev(x)1),··· ,f(rev(x)K)}) = arg maxc ∑K i=1 111{f(rev(x)i) = c}. Certiﬁed Robustness of DensePure with Randomized Smoothing. In this paragraph, we will illustrate the algorithm to calculate certiﬁed robustness ofDensePure via RS, which offers robustness guarantees for a model under a L2-norm ball. In particular, we follow the similar setting of Carlini et al. (2022) which uses a DDPM-based diffu- sion model. The overall algorithm contains three steps: (1) Our framework estimates n, the number of steps used for the reverse process of DDPM-based diffusion model. Since Randomized Smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) adds Gaussian noise ϵ, where ϵ∼N (0,σ2I), to data input xto get the randomized data input, xrs = x+ ϵ, we map between the noise required by the randomized example xrs and the noise required by the diffused data xn (i.e., xn ∼N (xn; √αnx0,(1 −αn)I)) with nstep diffusion processing so that αn = 1 1+σ2 . In this way, we can compute the corresponding timestep n, where n = arg mins{|αs − 1 1+σ2 || s ∈ {1,2,··· ,N}}. (2). Given the above calculated timestep n, we scale xrs with √αn to obtain the scaled randomized smoothing sample √αnxrs. Then we feed √αnxrs into the reverse process of the diffusion model by K-times to get the reversed sample set {ˆx1 0,ˆx2 0,··· ,ˆxi 0,··· ,ˆxK 0 }. (3). We feed the obtained reversed sample set into a standard off-the-shelf classiﬁer f to get the corresponding predicted labels {f(ˆx1 0),f(ˆx2 0),...,f (ˆxi 0),...,f (ˆxK 0 )}, and apply majority vote, denoted MV(···), on these predicted labels to get the ﬁnal label for xrs. Fast Sampling. To calculate the reversed sample, the standard reverse process of DDPM-based models require repeatedly applying a “single-step” operation ntimes to get the reversed sample ˆx0 (i.e., ˆx0 = Reverse(···Reverse(···Reverse(Reverse(√αnxrs; n); n−1); ··· ; i); ···1)   nsteps ). Here ˆxi−1 = Reverse(ˆxi; i) is equivalent to sample ˆxi−1 from N(ˆxi−1; µθ(ˆxi,i),Σθ(ˆxi,i)), where µθ(ˆxi,i) = 1√1−βi ( ˆxi − βi√1−αi ϵθ(ˆxi,i) ) and Σθ := exp(vlog βi + (1 −v) log ˜βi). Here vis a parameter learned by DDPM and ˜βi = 1−αi−1 1−αi . To reduce the time complexity, we use the uniform sub-sampling strategy from Nichol & Dhari- wal (2021). We uniformly sample a subsequence with size b from the original N-step the re- verse process. Note that Carlini et al. (2022) set b = 1 for the “one-shot” sampling, in this way, ˆx0 = 1√αn (xn−√1 −αnϵθ(√αnxrs,n)) is a deterministic value so that the reverse process does not obtain a posterior data distribution conditioned on the input. Instead, we can tune the num- ber of the sub-sampled DDPM steps to be larger than one ( b >1) to sample from a posterior data distribution conditioned on the input.

The lines represent the certiﬁed accuracy with different L2 perturbation bound with different Gaussian noise σ∈{0.25,0.50,1.00}. 5 E XPERIMENTS In this section, we useDensePure to evaluate certiﬁed robustness on two standard datasets, CIFAR- 10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Experimental settings We follow the experimental setting from Carlini et al. (2022). Speciﬁcally, for CIFAR-10, we use the 50-M unconditional improved diffusion model from Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) as the diffusion model. We select ViT-B/16 model Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) pretrained on ImageNet-21k and ﬁnetuned on CIFAR-10 as the classiﬁer, which could achieve 97.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10. For ImageNet, we use the unconditional 256 ×256 guided diffusion model from Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) as the diffusion model and pretrained BEiT large model (Bao et al., 2021) trained on ImageNet-21k as the classiﬁer, which could achieve 88.6% top-1 accuracy on validation set of ImageNet-1k. We select three different noise levels σ ∈{0.25,0.5,1.0}for certiﬁcation. For the parameters of DensePure , we set K = 40 and b= 10 except the results in ablation study. The details about the baselines are in the appendix. 5.1 M AIN RESULTS We compare our results with other baselines. The results are shown in Table 1. For CIFAR-10, comparing with the models which are carefully trained with randomized smoothing techniques in an end-to-end manner (i.e., w/o off-the-shelf classiﬁer), we observe that our method with the standard off-the-shelf classiﬁer outperforms them at smaller ϵ = {0.25,0.5}on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets while achieves comparable performance at largerϵ= {0.75,1.0}. Comparing with the non-diffusion model based methods with off-the-shelf classiﬁer (i.e., De- noised (Salman et al., 2020) and Lee (Lee, 2021)), both our method and Carlini et al. (2022) are signiﬁcantly better than them. These results verify the non-trivial adversarial robustness improve- 7DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Figure 4: Ablation study on ImageNet. The left image shows the certiﬁed accuracy among different vote numbers with different radius ϵ ∈{0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75}. Each line in the ﬁgure represents the certiﬁed accuracy of our method among different vote numbers K with Gaussian noise σ = 0.25. The right image shows the certiﬁed accuracy with different fast sampling steps b. Each line in the ﬁgure shows the certiﬁed accuracy among different L2 adversarial perturbation bound. ments introduced from the diffusion model. For ImageNet, our method is consistently better than all priors with a large margin. Since both Carlini et al. (2022) and DensePure use the diffusion model, to better understand the importance of our design, that approximates the label of the high density region in the conditional distribution, we compare DensePure with Carlini et al. (2022) in a more ﬁne-grained manner. We show detailed certiﬁed robustness of the model among differentσat different radius for CIFAR- 10 in Figure 3-left and for ImageNet in Figure 3-right. We also present our results of certiﬁed accu- racy at different ϵin Appendix D.3. From these results, we ﬁnd that our method is still consistently better at mostϵ(except ϵ= 0) among differentσ. The performance margin between ours and Carlini et al. (2022) will become even larger with a large ϵ. These results further indicate that although the diffusion model improves model robustness, leveraging the posterior data distribution conditioned on the input instance (like DensePure ) via reverse process instead of using single sample ((Carlini et al., 2022)) is the key for better robustness. Additionally, we use the off-the-shelf classiﬁers, which are the VIT-based architectures trained a larger dataset. In the later ablation study section, we select the CNN-based architecture wide-ResNet trained on standard dataset from scratch. Our method still achieves non-trivial robustness. 5.2 A BLATION STUDY Voting samples (K) We ﬁrst show how K affects the certiﬁed accuracy. For efﬁciency, we select b= 10. We conduct experiments for both datasets. We show the certiﬁed accuracy among differentr at σ= 0.25 in Figure 4. The results for σ= 0.5,1.0 and CIFAR-10 are shown in the Appendix D.4. Comparing with the baseline (Carlini et al., 2022), we ﬁnd that a larger majority vote number leads to a better certiﬁed accuracy. It veriﬁes that DensePure indeed beneﬁts the adversarial robustness and making a good approximation of the label with high density region requires a large number of voting samples. We ﬁnd that our certiﬁed accuracy will almost converge at r = 40. Thus, we set r= 40 for our experiments. The results with other σshow the similar tendency. Fast sampling steps ( b) To investigate the role of b, we conduct additional experiments with b ∈ {2,5}at σ= 0.25. The results on ImageNet are shown in Figure 4 and results for σ= 0.5,1.0 and CIFAR-10 are shown in the Appendix D.5. By observing results with majority vote, we ﬁnd that a larger bcan lead to a better certiﬁed accuracy since a larger bgenerates images with higher quality. By observing results without majority vote, the results show opposite conclusions where a larger b leads to a lower certiﬁed accuracy, which contradicts to our intuition. We guess the potential reason is that though more sampling steps can normally lead to better image recovery quality, it also brings more randomness, increasing the probability that the reversed image locates into a data region with the wrong label. These results further verify that majority vote is necessary for a better performance. Different architectures One advantage of DensePure is to use the off-the-shelf classiﬁer so that it can plug in any classiﬁer. We choose Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures: Wide-ResNet28-10 (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) for CIFAR-10 with95.1% accuracy and Wide- 8DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Certiﬁed Accuracy atϵ(%)Datasets Methods Model 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 Model 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 CIFAR-10 Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) ViT-B/1693.0 76.0 57.0 47.0 WRN28-10 86.0 66.0 55.0 37.0Ours ViT-B/16 92.082.0 69.0 56.0 WRN28-1090.0 77.0 63.0 50.0 ImageNet Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) BEiT 77.0 76.0 71.0 60.0WRN50-2 73.0 67.0 57.0 48.0Ours BEiT 80.0 78.0 76.0 71.0 WRN50-281.0 72.0 66.0 61.0 Table 2: Certiﬁed accuracy of our method among different classiﬁer.

WideRes- Net is trained on ImageNet-1k for ImageNet and trained on CIFAR-10 from scratch for CIFAR-10. ResNet50-2 for ImageNet with 81.5% top-1 accuracy, atσ= 0.25. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure E in Appendix D.6. Results for more model architectures and σ of ImageNet are also shown in Appendix D.6. We show that our method can enhance the certiﬁed robustness of any given classiﬁer trained on the original data distribution. Noticeably, although the performance of CNN- based classiﬁer is lower than Transformer-based classiﬁer, DensePure with CNN-based model as the classiﬁer can outperform Carlini et al. (2022) with ViT-based model as the classiﬁer (except ϵ= 0 for CIFAR-10). 6 R ELATED WORK Using an off-the-shelf generative model to purify adversarial perturbations has become an important direction in adversarial defense. Previous works have developed various puriﬁcation methods based on different generative models, such as GANs (Samangouei et al., 2018), autoregressive generative models (Song et al., 2018), and energy-based models (Du & Mordatch, 2019; Grathwohl et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2021). More recently, as diffusion models (or score-based models) achieve better generation quality than other generative models (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), many works consider using diffusion models for adversarial puriﬁcation (Nie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022) Although they have found good empirical results in defending against existing adversarial attacks (Nie et al., 2022), there is no provable guarantee about the robustness about such methods. On the other hand, certiﬁed defenses provide guarantees of robustness (Mirman et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019; Lecuyer et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2020; Horv´ath et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018a;b; Salman et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2021). They provide a lower bounder of model accuracy under constrained perturbations. Among them, approaches Lecuyer et al. (2019); Cohen et al. (2019); Salman et al. (2019a); Jeong & Shin (2020); Zhai et al. (2020); Horv´ath et al. (2021); Jeong et al. (2021); Salman et al. (2020); Lee (2021); Carlini et al. (2022) based on randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) show the great scalability and achieve promising performance on large network and dataset. The most similar work to us is Carlini et al. (2022), which uses diffusion models combined with standard classiﬁers for certiﬁed defense. They view diffusion model as blackbox without having a theoretical under- standing of why and how the diffusion models contribute to such nontrivial certiﬁed robustness. 7 C ONCLUSION In this work, we theoretically prove that the diffusion model could purify adversarial examples back to the corresponding clean sample with high probability, as long as the data density of the cor- responding clean samples is high enough. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the conditional distribution of the reversed samples given the adversarial input, generated by the diffusion model reverse process. Using the highest density point in the conditional distribution as the deterministic reversed sample, we identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model re- verse process, which is potentially much larger than previous methods. Our analysis inspires us to propose an effective pipeline DensePure, for adversarial robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the effectiveness of DensePure by evaluating the certiﬁed robustness via the randomized smoothing algorithm. Note that DensePure is an off-the-shelf pipeline that does not require training a smooth classiﬁer. Our results show that DensePure achieves the new SOTA cer- tiﬁed robustness for perturbation with L2-norm. We hope that our work sheds light on an in-depth understanding of the diffusion model for adversarial robustness. 9DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Limitations. The time complexity of DensePure is high since it requires repeating the reverse process multiple times. In this paper, we use fast sampling to reduce the time complexity and show that the setting ( b = 2 and K = 10) can achieve nontrivial certiﬁed accuracy. We leave the more advanced fast sampling strategy as the future direction. ETHICS STATEMENT Our work can positively impact the society by improving the robustness and security of AI systems. We have not involved human subjects or data set releases; instead, we carefully follow the provided licenses of existing data and models for developing and evaluating our method.

Under conditions B.1, solving equation reverse-SDE starting from time tand point xa,t = √αtxa will generate a reversed random variable ˆx0 with conditional distribution P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) ∝p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t where σ2 t = 1−αt αt is the variance of the Gaussian noise added at timestamp t in the diffusion process SDE. Proof. Under the assumption, we know {xt}t∈[0,1] and {ˆxt}t∈[0,1] follow the same distribution, which means P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) = P(ˆx0 = x,ˆxt = xa,t) P(ˆxt = xa,t) = P(x0 = x,xt = xa,t) P(xt = xa,t) = P(x0 = x) P(xt = xa,t|x0 = x) P(xt = xa,t) ∝P(x0 = x) 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t = p(x) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x−xa||2 2 2σ2 t where the third equation is due to the chain rule of probability and the last equation is a result of the diffusion process. Theorem 3.3. Under conditions B.1 and classiﬁer f, let x0 be the sample with ground-truth label and xa be the adversarial sample, then (i) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if xa falls into the following convex set, Dsub (x0; t) := ⋂ {x′ 0:f(x′ 0)̸=f(x0)} { xa : (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + ||x′ 0 −x0||2 2 2 } , and further, (ii) the puriﬁed sample P(xa; t) will have the ground-truth label if and only if xa falls into the following set, D(G(x0); t) := ⋃ ˜x0:f(˜x0)=f(x0) Dsub (˜x0; t). In other words, D(G(x0); t) is the robust region for data regionG(x0) under P(·; t) and f. Proof. We start with part (i). 14DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness The main idea is to prove that a point x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0) should have lower density than x0 in the conditional distribution in Theorem 3.1 so thatP(xa; t) cannot be x′ 0. In other words, we should have P(ˆx0 = x0|ˆxt = xa,t) >P(ˆx0 = x′ 0 |ˆxt = xxxa,t) . By Theorem 3.1, this is equivalent to p(x0) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x0−xa||2 2 2σ2 t >p(x′ 0) · 1√ (2πσ2 t)ne −||x′ 0−xa||2 2 2σ2 t ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( ||x0 −xa||2 2 −||x′ 0 −xa||2 2 ) ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( ||x0 −xa||2 2 −||x′ 0 −x0 + x0 −xa||2 2 ) ⇔log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) > 1 2σ2 t ( 2(xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) −∥x′ 0 −x0∥2 2 ) . Re-organizing the above inequality, we obtain (xa −x0)⊤(x′ 0 −x0) <σ2 t log (p(x0) p(x′ 0) ) + 1 2||x′ 0 −x0||2 2. Note that the order of xa is at most one in every term of the above inequality, so the inequality actually deﬁnes a half-space in Rn for every (x0,x′ 0) pair. Further, we have to satisfy the inequality for every x′ 0 such that f(x′ 0) ̸= f(x0), therefore, by intersecting over all such half-spaces, we obtain a convex Dsub (x0; t). Then we prove part (ii). On the one hand, if xa ∈D (G(x0); t), then there exists one ˜x0 such that f(˜x0) = f(x0) and xa ∈Dsub (˜x0; t). By part (i), ˜x0 has higher probability than all other points with different la- bels from x0 in the conditional distribution P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t) characterized by Theorem 3.1. Therefore, P(xa; t) should have the same label as x0. On the other hand, if xa /∈D (G(x0); t), then there is a point ˜x1 with different label from x0 such that for any ˜x0 with the same label as x0, P(ˆx0 = ˜x1|ˆxt = xa,t) > P(ˆx0 = ˜x0|ˆxt = xa,t). In other words, P(xa; t) would have different label from x0. Theorem 3.4. Under score-based diffusion model Song et al. (2021b) and conditions B.1, we can bound DKL(P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t)) = JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) where {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] are stochastic processes generated by reverse-SDE and score- based diffusion model respectively, JSM(θ,t; λ(·)) := 1 2 ∫ t 0 Epτ(x) [ λ(τ) ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ, sθ(x,τ) is the score function to approximate∇x log pτ(x), and λ: R →R is any weighting scheme used in the training score-based diffusion models. Proof. Similar to proof of (Song et al., 2021a, Theorem 1), let µt and νt be the path measure for reverse processes {ˆxτ}τ∈[0,t] and {xθ τ}τ∈[0,t] respectively based on the scaled adversarial sample xa,t. Under conditions B.1, the KL-divergence can be computed via the Girsanov theorem Oksendal 15DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness (2013): DKL ( P(ˆx0 = x|ˆxt = xa,t)∥P(xθ 0 = x|xθ t = xa,t) ) = −Eµt [ log dνt dµt ] (i) = Eµt [∫ t 0 g(τ) (∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)) dwτ + 1 2 ∫ t 0 g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 dτ ] = Eµt [1 2 ∫ t 0 g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 dτ ] = 1 2 ∫ τ 0 Epτ(x) [ g(τ)2 ∥∇x log pτ(x) −sθ(x,τ)∥2 2 ] dτ = JSM ( θ,t; g(·)2) where (i) is due to Girsanov Theorem and (ii) is due to the martingale property of Itˆo integrals.

In order to reduce the time complexity, we follow the method used in (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) and sample a subsequence Sb with bvalues (i.e., Sb = {n,⌊n−n b⌋,··· ,1}    b , where Sb j is the j-th element in Sb and Sb j = ⌊n−jn b ⌋,∀j < band Sb b = 1) from the original schedule S (i.e., S = {n,n −1,··· ,1}   n , where Sj = jis the j-th element in S). Within this context, we adapt the original αschedule αS = {α1,··· ,αi,··· ,αn}used for single- step to the new schedule αSb = {αSb 1 ,··· ,αSb j ,··· ,αSb b }(i.e., αSb i = αSb i = αS⌊n−in b ⌋ is the i-th element in αSb ). We calculate the corresponding βSb = {βSb 1 ,βSb 2 ,··· ,βSb i ,··· ,βSb b }and ˜βSb = {˜βSb 1 ,˜βSb 2 ,··· ,˜βSb i ,··· ,˜βSb b }schedules, where βSb i = βSb i = 1 − αSb i αSb i−1 , ˜βSb i = ˜βSb i = 1−αSb i−1 1−αSb i βSb i . With these new schedules, we can use b times reverse steps to calculate 16DensePure: Understanding Diffusion Models Towards Adversarial Robustness Certiﬁed Accuracy atϵ(%) Methods Noise 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 σ= 0.25 88.0 73.8 56.2 41.6 0.0 Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022)σ= 0.5 74.2 62.0 50.4 40.2 31.0 σ= 1.0 49.4 41.4 34.2 27.8 21.8 σ= 0.25 87.6(-0.4) 76.6(+2.8) 64.6(+8.4) 50.4(+8.8) 0.0(+0.0) Ours σ= 0.5 73.6(-0.6) 65.4(+3.4) 55.6(+5.2) 46.0(+5.8) 37.4(+6.4) σ= 1.0 55.0(+5.6) 47.8(+6.4) 40.8(+6.6) 33.0(+5.2) 28.2(+6.4) Table A: Certiﬁed accuracy compared with Carlini et al.

D M ORE EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS D.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS We select three different noise levels σ ∈ {0.25,0.5,1.0}for certiﬁcation. For the parameters of DensePure , The sampling numbers when computing the certiﬁed radius are n = 100000 for CIFAR-10 andn= 10000 for ImageNet. We evaluate the certiﬁed robustness on 500 samples subset of CIFAR-10 testset and 500 samples subset of ImageNet validation set. we set K = 40 and b= 10 except the results in ablation study. The details about the baselines are in the appendix. D.2 B ASELINES . We select randomized smoothing based methods including PixelDP (Lecuyer et al., 2019), RS (Co- hen et al., 2019), SmoothAdv (Salman et al., 2019a), Consistency (Jeong & Shin, 2020), MACER (Zhai et al., 2020), Boosting (Horv ´ath et al., 2021) , SmoothMix (Jeong et al., 2021), Denoised (Salman et al., 2020), Lee (Lee, 2021), Carlini (Carlini et al., 2022) as our baselines. Among them, PixelDP, RS, SmoothAdv, Consistency, MACER, and SmoothMix require training a smooth clas- siﬁer for a better certiﬁcation performance while the others do not. Salman et al. and Lee use the off-the-shelf classiﬁer but without using the diffusion model. The most similar one compared with us is Carlini et al., which also uses both the off-the-shelf diffusion model and classiﬁer. The above two settings mainly refer to Carlini et al. (2022), which makes us easier to compared with their results. D.3 M AIN RESULTS FOR CERTIFIED ACCURACY We compare with Carlini et al. (2022) in a more ﬁne-grained version.

While attempts to train improved classifiers with synthetic data have proved challenging, Azizi et al. [2] impressively demonstrated that extending the training dataset with synthetic images generated using Imagen [38] — with appropriate sampling parameters (e.g. prompt and guidance strength) — could indeed improve Imagenet classification. In a similar experiment with Stable Diffusion (SD) [ 37], Sariyildiz et al. [41] studied classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic images (i.e. no real images) and discovered improvements when training on a subset of 100 Imagenet classes. The success of generative data augmentation depends crucially on sample quality [36], so these findings irrefutably highlight the superior generative abilities of diffusion models. Despite these impressive findings, widespread adoption of diffusion models for synthetic data augmentation is constrained by high computational cost of diffusion sampling, which requires multiple steps of reverse diffusion to ensure sufficient sample quality. Furthermore, both SD and Imagen are trained on upstream datasets much larger than Imagenet and some of these improvements could also be attributed to the quality and scale of the upstream dataset [18]. For example, Bansal and Grover [4] find no advantage in synthetic examples generated from a diffusion model trained solely on Imagenet. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2306.09192v2  [cs.CV]  29 May 2024Together, these limitations motivate us to explore a diffusion-based augmentation technique that is not only computationally efficient but can also enhance classifier training without relying on extra data. To that end, we consider the following questions: 1. Can we leverage a diffusion model trained with no extra data? 2. Can we train improved classifiers with a single step of reverse diffusion? In the context of reverse diffusion sampling, the intermediate output obtained after one reverse diffusion (i.e., denoising) step is commonly interpreted as an approximation of the final image by previous works and has been utilised to define the guidance function at each step of guided reverse- diffusion (e.g., [3, 9, 10]). Similarly, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS) [ 5] applies denoised smoothing [39], a certified adversarial defense for pretrained classifiers, using one reverse diffusion step. In contrast to previous work, we use the output from a single reverse diffusion step as an augmentation to train classifiers (i.e., not just at inference time) as we describe next. Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation Considering a diffusion model defined such that time t = 0 refers to the data distribution and time t = T refers to isotropic Gaussian noise, we propose to generate augmentations of train examples by first applying a Gaussian perturbation (i.e., forward- diffusion to a random time t ∈ [0, T]) and then crucially, applying a single diffusion denoising step (i.e., one-step reverse diffusion). That is, we treat these diffused-and-denoised examples as augmentations of the original train image and refer to this technique as DiffAug. A one-step diffusion denoised example derived from a Gaussian perturbed train example can also be interpreted as an intermediate sample in some reverse diffusion sequence that starts with pure noise and ends at the train example. Interpreted this way, our classifier can be viewed as having been trained on partially- synthesized images whose ostensible quality varies from unrecognizable (DiffAug using t ≈ T) to excellent (DiffAug using t ≈ 0). This is surprising because, while Ravuri and Vinyals [36] find that expanding the train dataset even with a small fraction of (lower quality) synthetic examples can lead to noticeable drops in classification accuracy, we find that classifier accuracy over test examples does not degrade despite being explicitly trained with partially synthesized train images. Instead, we show that diffusion-denoised examples offer a regularization effect when training classifiers that leads to improved classifier robustness without sacrificing clean test accuracy and without requiring additional data. Our contributions in this work are as follows: (a) DiffAug We propose DiffAug, a simple, efficient and effective diffusion-based augmentation technique. We provide a qualitative and analytical discussion on the unique regularization effect — complementary to other leading and classic augmentation methods — introduced by DiffAug. (b) Robust Classification. Using both ResNet-50 and ViT architectures, we evaluate the models in terms of their robustness to covariate shifts, adversarial examples (i.e., certified accuracy under Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)[5]) and out-of-distribution detection. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble (DE) We extend DiffAug to test-time and introduce DE, a simple test-time image augmentation/adaptation technique to improve robustness to covariate shift that is not only competitive with DDA [17], the state-of-the-art image adaptation method but also 10x faster. (d) Perceptual Gradient Alignment. Motivated by the success of DDS and evidence of perceptually aligned gradients (PAGs) in robust classifiers, we qualitatively analyse the classifier gradients and discover the perceptual alignment described in previous works. We then theoretically analyse the gradients through the score function to explain this perceptual alignment. (e) Improved Classifier-Guided Diffusion. Finally, we build on (d) to improve gradient quality in guidance classifiers and demonstrate improvements in terms of: (i) generalization, (ii) perceptual gradient alignment and (iii) image generation performance. 2 Background The stochastic diffusion framework [43] consists of two key components: 1) the forward-diffusion (i.e., data to noise) stochastic process, and 2) a learnable score-function that can then be used for the reverse-diffusion (i.e., noise to data) stochastic process. The forward diffusion stochastic process {xt}t∈[0,T] starts at data, x0, and ends at noise, xT . We let pt(x) denote the probability density of x at time t such that p0(x) is the data distribution, and pT (x) 2denotes the noise distribution. The diffusion is defined with a stochastic-differential-equation (SDE): dx = f(x, t) dt + g(t) dw, (1) where w denotes a standard Wiener process, f(x, t) is a drift coefficient, and g(t) is a diffusion coefficient. The drift and diffusion coefficients are usually specified manually such that the solution to the SDE with initial value x0 is a time-varying Gaussian distribution pt(x|x0) whose mean µ(x0, t) and standard deviation σ(t) can be exactly computed. To sample from p0(x) starting with samples from pT (x), we solve the reverse diffusion SDE [1]: dx = [f(x, t) − g(t)2∇x log pt(x)] dt + g(t) d¯ w, (2) where d¯ wis a standard Wiener process when time flows from T to 0, and dt is an infinitesimal negative timestep. In practice, the score function ∇x log pt(x) is estimated by a neural network sθ(x, t), parameterized by θ, trained using a score-matching loss [43]. Denoised Examples. Given (x0, y) ∼ p0 and x ∼ pt(x|x0) = N(x | µ(x0, t), σ2(t)I), we can compute the denoised image ˆxt using the pretrained score network sθ as: ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t) (3) Intuitively, ˆxt is an expectation over all possible images mt = µ(x0, t) that are likely to have been perturbed with N(0, σ2(t)I) to generate x and the denoised example ˆxt can be written as ˆxt = E[mt|x] = Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt (4) We note that the mean does not change with diffusion time t in variance-exploding SDEs while the mean decays to zero with diffusion time for variance-preserving SDEs (DDPMs). 3 DiffAug: Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation 𝐱! 𝐱\"!𝐱\"\" Figure 1: DiffAug Augmentations. The leftmost col- umn shows four original training examples (x0); to the right of that, we display 8 random augmentations ( ˆxt) for each image between t = 350and t = 700in steps of size 50. Augmentations generated for t <350 are closer to the input image while the augmentations for t >700 are farther from the input image. We observe that the diffusion denoised augmentations with larger values of t do not preserve the class label introducing noise in the training procedure. However, we find that this does not lead to empirical degradation of classification accuracy but instead contributes to improved robustness. Also, see Fig. 6 in appendix for a toy 2d example. In this section, we describe Diffuse-and-Denoise Augmentation (DiffAug, in short) and then pro- vide an analytical and qualitative discussion on the role of denoised examples in training clas- sifiers. While we are not aware of any previous study on training classifiers with denoised ex- amples, Diffusion-denoised smoothing (DDS) [5], DiffPure [33] and Diffusion Driven Adap- tation (DDA) [ 17] are test-time applications of — single-step (DDS) and multi-step (Diff- Pure/DDA) — denoised examples to promote robustness in pretrained classifiers. As implied by its name, DiffAug consists of two key steps: (i) Diffuse: first, we diffuse a train example x0 to a uniformly sampled time t ∼ U(0, T) and generate x ∼ pt(x|x0); (ii) Denoise: then, we denoise x using a single ap- plication of trained score network sθ as shown in Eq. 3 to generate ˆxt. We assume that the class label does not change upon augmentation (see discussion below) and train the classifier to minimize the following cross-entropy loss: L = Et,x0 [−log pϕ(y|ˆxt)] (5) where, t ∼ U(0, T), (x0, y) ∼ p0(x), and pϕ denotes the classifier parameterized by ϕ. In this work, we show the effectiveness of DiffAug as a standalone augmentation technique, as well as the further compounding effect of combining it with robustness-enhancing techniques such as Augmix and DeepAugment, showing that DiffAug is achieving a robustness not captured by the other approaches. When combining DiffAug with such novel augmentation techniques, we simply include Eq. 5 as an additional optimization objective instead of stacking augmentations (for example, we can alternatively apply DiffAug to images augmented with Augmix/DeepAugment or vice-versa). Also, our preliminary analysis on stacking augmentations showed limited gains over simply training the network to classify independently augmented samples likely because training on independent augmentations implicitly generalizes to stacked augmentations. 3Qualitative Analysis and Manifold Theory. When generating augmentations, it is important to ensure that the resulting augmentations lie on the image manifold. Recent studies [ 9, 34] on theoretical properties of denoised examples suggest that denoised examples can be considered to be on the data manifold under certain assumptions lending theoretical support to the idea of using denoised examples as augmentations. We can interpret training on denoised examples as a type of Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) since the denoised examples can be considered to lie in the vicinal distribution of training samples. Previous works have shown that VRM improves generalization: for example, Chapelle et al. [8] use Gaussian perturbed examples (x) as the vicinal distribution while MixUp [52] uses a convex sum of two random inputs (and their labels) as the vicinal distribution. From Eq. 4, we can observe that a denoised example is a convex sum over mt and we can interpret ˆxt as being vicinal to examples mt that have a non-trivial likelihood, pt(mt|x), of generating x. The distribution pt(mt|x) is concentrated around examples perceptually similar to µ(x0, t) when x is closer to x0 (i.e., smaller σ(t)) and becomes more entropic as the noise scale increases: we can qualitatively observe this in Fig. 1. Diffusion denoised augmentations generated from larger σ(t) can introduce label-noise into the training since the class-labels may not be preserved upon augmentation – for example, some of the diffusion denoised augmentations of the dog in Fig. 1 resemble architectural buildings. Augmenta- tions that alter the true class-label are said to cause manifold intrusion [20] leading to underfitting and lower classification accuracies. In particular, accurate predictions on class-altered augmented examples would be incorrectly penalised causing the classifier to output less confident predictions on all inputs (i.e., underfitting). Interestingly, however, diffusion denoised augmentations that alter the true-class label are also of lower sample quality. The correlation between label noise and sample qual- ity allows the model to selectively lower its prediction confidence when classifying denoised samples generated from larger perturbations applied to x0 (we empirically confirm this in Section 4). In other words, the classifier learns to observe important details in ˆxt to determine the optimal prediction estimating the class-membership probabilities of x0. On the other hand, any augmentation that alters class-label by preserving the sample quality can impede the classifier training since the classifier cannot rely on visual cues to selectively lower its confidence (for an example, see Fig. 7 in appendix). Therefore, we do not consider multi-step denoising techniques to generate augmentations — despite their potential to improve sample quality — since this would effectively decorrelate label-noise and sample-quality necessitating additional safeguards — e.g., we would then need to determine the maximum diffusion time we could use for augmentation without altering the class-label or scale down the loss terms corresponding to samples generated from larger σ(t) — that are out of scope of this work. Test-time Augmentation with DiffAug. Test-time Augmentation (TTA) [28] is a technique to improve classifier prediction using several augmented copies of a single test example. A simple yet successful TTA technique is to just average the model predictions for each augmentation of a test sample. We extend DiffAug to generate test-time augmentations of a test-example wherein we apply DiffAug using different values of diffusion times t and utilize the average predictions across all the augmentations to classify the test example x0: p(y|x0) = 1 |S| X t∈S pϕ(y|ˆxt) (6) where, S denotes the set of diffusion times considered. We refer to this as DiffAug Ensemble (DE). A forward diffusion step followed by diffusion denoising can be interpreted as projecting a test-example with unknown distribution shift into the source distribution and forms the basis of DDA, a diffusion-based image adaptation technique. Different from DE, DDA uses a novel multi-step denoising technique to transform the diffused test example into the source distribution. Since DE uses single-step denoised examples of forward diffused samples, we observe significant improvement in terms of running time while either improving over or remaining on par with DDA. 4 Experiments I: Classifier Robustness In this section, we evaluate classifiers trained with DiffAug in terms of their standard classification accuracy as well as their robustness to distribution shifts and adversarial examples. We primarily conduct our experiments on Imagenet-1k and use the unconditional 256 ×256 Improved-DDPM [13, 32] diffusion model to generate the augmentations. We apply DiffAug to train the popular ResNet-50 (RN-50) backbone as well as the recent Vision-Transformer (ViT) model (ViT-B-16, in 4Table 1: Top-1 Accuracy (%) on Imagenet-C (severity=5) and Imagenet-Test. We summarize the results for each combination of Train-augmentations and evaluation modes. The average (avg) accuracies for each classifier and evaluation mode is shown.

In addition to extending the default augmentations used to train RN-50/ViT with DiffAug, we also combine our method with the following effective robustness-enhancing augmentations: (i) AugMix (AM), (ii) DeepAugment (DA) and (iii) DeepAugment+AugMix (DAM). While we train the RN-50 from scratch, we follow DeIT-III recipe[46] for training ViTs and apply DiffAug in the second training stage; when combining with AM/DA/DAM, we finetune the official checkpoint for 10 epochs. More details are included in Appendix B.1. In the following, we will evaluate the classifier robustness to (i) covariate shifts, (ii) adversarial examples and (iii) out-of-distribution examples. Covariate Shifts To evaluate the classifiers trained with/without DiffAug in terms of their robustness to covariate-shifts, we consider the following evaluation modes: (a) DDA: A diffusion-based test-time image-adaptation technique to transform the test image into the source distribution. (b) DDA-SE: We consider the original test example as well as the DDA-adapted test-example by averaging the classifier predictions following the self-ensemble (SE) strategy proposed in [17]. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble (DE): We use a set of test-time DiffAug augmentations to classify a test example as described in Eq. (6). Following DDA, we determine the following range of diffusion times S = {0, 50, . . . ,450}. In other words, we generate 9 DiffAug augmentations for each test example. (d) Default: In the default mode, we directly evaluate the model on the test examples. We evaluate the classifiers on Imagenet-C, a dataset of 15 synthetic corruptions applied to Imagenet- test and summarize the results across all evaluation modes in Table 1. We summarize our observations as follows: (i) DiffAug introduces consistent improvements Classifiers trained with DiffAug consistently improve over their counterparts trained without these augmentations across all evaluation modes. The average relative improvements across all corruptions range from 5.3% to 28.7% in the default evaluation mode (see Table 5 in Appendix). On clean examples, we observe that DiffAug helps minimize the gap between default evaluation mode and other evaluation modes while effectively preserving the default accuracy. (ii) DE improves over DDA On average, DiffAug Ensemble (DE) yields improved detection rate as compared to direct evaluation on DDA images. Furthermore, DiffAug-trained classifiers evaluated using DE improve on average over their counterparts (trained without DiffAug) evaluated using DDA-SE. This experiment interestingly reveals that a set of one-step diffusion denoised images (DE) can achieve improvements comparable to multi-step diffusion denoised images (DDA) at a substantially faster (∼ 10x) wallclock time (see Table 7 in Appendix). We also evaluate the classifiers on Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S and include the results in the Appendix (Table 6). Although DiffAug training yields slight improvements over Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S 5in default evaluation, we observe that DE introduces some notable improvements over all other evaluation modes.

Test examples whose labels do not overlap with the labels of the train distribution are referred to as out-of-distribution examples. To evaluate the classifiers in terms of their OOD-detection rates, we use the Imagenet near-OOD detection task defined in the OpenOOD benchmark, which also includes an implementation of recent OOD de- tection algorithms such as ASH[14], ReAct[45], Scale[49] and MSP[22]. For context, while the torchvision ResNet-50 checkpoint is most commonly used to evaluate new OOD detection algorithms, AugMix provides the best OOD detection amongst the existing robustness-enhancing augmentation techniques and AugMix/ASH is placed 3rd amongst 73 methods on the OpenOOD leaderboard (ordered by near-OOD performance). Yet in Table 2 we observe that DiffAug introduces further improvement on the challenging near-OOD detection task across all considered OOD algorithms. 0 200 400 600 800 t 0 2 4 6Entropy (nats) Maximum Entropy DA +DiffAug AM +DiffAug DAM +DiffAug Figure 2: Average prediction entropy on DiffAug sam- ples vs diffusion time measured with Imagenet-Test. We observe that the models trained with DiffAug correctly yield predictions with higher entropies (lower confi- dence) for images containing imperceptible details (i.e. larger t). Surprisingly, the classifiers trained without DiffAug do not also assign random-uniform label distri- bution for diffusion denoised images at t = 999, which have no class-related information by construction. Also, see Fig. 9. Comparing our results to the leaderboard, we ob- serve AugMix+DiffAug/Scale achieves an AU- ROC of 84.81 outperforming the second best method (84.01 AUROC) and comparable to the top AUROC of 84.87. DiffAug training teaches the network to selectively lower its prediction confidence (higher prediction entropy) based on the image content (Fig. 2) and we hypothesize that this leads to improved OOD detection rates. We include the detailed OOD detection results in Appendix B.4. Interestingly, the combination of augmentations that improve robustness on covariate shifts may not necessarily lead to im- proved OOD detection rates: for example, Aug- Mix+DeepAugment improves over both Aug- Mix and DeepAugment on covariate shift but achieves lower OOD detection rates than either. On the other hand, we observe that combining with DiffAug enhances both OOD detection as well as robustness to covariate shift. Certified Adversarial Accuracy. Denoised smoothing [39] is a certified defense for pre- trained classifiers inspired from Randomized smoothing [11] wherein noisy copies of a test image are first denoised and then used as classifier input to estimate both the class-label and robust radius for each example. Using the same diffusion model as ours, DDS[5] already achieves state-of-the-art certified Imagenet accuracies with a pretrained 305M-parameter BeIT-L. Here, we evaluate the improvement in certified accuracy when applying DDS to a model trained with DiffAug and include the results in Appendix B.3. We speculate that finetuning the BeIT-L model with DiffAug should lead to similar improvements but skip this experiment since it is computationally expensive. Figure 3: PAG example using ViT+DiffAug. We diffuse the Imagenet example (left) to t = 300and visualise the min-max normalized classifier gradients (right). For easy viewing, we apply contrast maximization. More examples are shown below. Perceptually Aligned Gradients and Robustness Classifier gradients (∇z log pϕ(y|z) where z is an image) which are semantically aligned with human perception are said to be perceptually aligned gradients (PAG) [16]. While input-gradients of a typical image classifier are usually unin- telligible, gradients obtained from adversarially robust classifiers trained using randomized smoothing [26] or adversarial training [15, 40, 48] are perceptually-aligned. Motivated by the state-of-the-art certified adver- sarial accuracy achieved by DDS, we analyse the classifier gradients of one-step diffusion denoised examples — i.e., we analyse∇x log pϕ(y|ˆxt) where x = pt(x|x0) and ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t). We visualise the gra- dients in Fig. 3 and interestingly discover the same perceptual alignment 6of gradients discussed in previous works (we compare with gradients of classifiers trained with randomized smoothing later). To theoretically analyse this effect, we first decompose the input-gradient using chain rule as: d log pϕ(y|ˆxt) dx = d log pϕ(y|ˆxt) dˆxt dˆxt dx (7) Empirically, we find that the perceptual alignment is introduced due to transformation by dˆxt dx and analyse it further: Theorem 4.1. Consider a forward-diffusion SDE defined as in Eq. 1 such that pt(x|x0) = N(x | mt, σ2(t)I) where mt = µ(x0, t). If x ∼ pt(x) and ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t), for opti- mal parameters θ, the derivative of ˆxt w.r.t. x is proportional to the covariance matrix of the conditional distribution p(mt|x). See proof in Appendix B.7. ∂ˆxt ∂x = J = 1 σ2(t)Cov[mt|x] This theorem shows us that the multiplication by ∂ˆxt ∂x in Eq (7) is in fact a transformation by the covariance matrix Cov[mt|x]. Multiplying a vector by Cov[mt|x] stretches the vector along the principal directions of the conditional distribution p(mt|x). Intuitively, since the conditional distribution p(mt|x) corresponds to the distribution of candidate denoised images, the principal directions of variation are perceptually aligned (to demonstrate, we apply SVD to J and visualise the principal components in Appendix B.8) and hence stretching the gradient along these directions will yield perceptually aligned gradients. We note that our derivation complements Proposition 1 in Chung et al. [9] which proves certain properties (e.g., J = J⊤) of this derivative. In practice, however, the score-function is parameterized by unconstrained, flexible neural architectures that do not have exactly symmetric jacobian matrices J. For more details on techniques to enforce conservative properties of score-functions, we refer the reader to Chao et al. [7]. Ganz et al. [16] demonstrate that training a classifier to have perceptually aligned gradients also improves its robustness exposing the bidirectional relationship between robustness and PAGs. This works offers additional evidence supporting the co-occurrence of robustness and PAGs since we observe that classification of diffused-and-denoised images (e.g., DDS, DE, DDA) not only improve robustness but also produce PAGs. Ablation Analysis. Appendix B.5 includes an ablation study on the following: (a) Extra Training: The pretrained DA, AM, and DAM classifiers are sufficiently trained for 180 epochs and hence, we compare the DiffAug finetuned model directly with the pretrained checkpoint. For completeness, we train AugMix for another 10 epochs and confirm that there is no notable change in performance as compared to results in Tables 1, 2 and 6. (b) DiffAug Hyperparameters In our experiments, we considered the complete range of diffusion time. We investigate a simple variation where we either use t ∈ [0, 500] or t ∈ [500, 999] to generate the DiffAug augmentations. (c) DiffAug-Ensemble Hyperparameters We analyse how the choice of diffusion times considered in the set S (Eq. (6)) affects DE performance. 5 Experiments II: Classifier-Guided Diffusion Classifier guided (CG) diffusion is a conditional generation technique to generate class-conditional samples with an unconditional diffusion model. To achieve this, a time-conditional classifier is separately trained to classify noisy samples from the forward diffusion and we refer to this as a guidance classifier LCE = Et,x[−log pϕ(y|x, t)] (8) where, t ∼ U(0, T), x ∼ pt(x|x0) and (x0, y) ∼ p0(x). At each step of the classifier-guided reverse diffusion (Eq. (2)), the guidance classifier is used to compute the class-conditional score ∇x log pt(x|y) =∇x log pϕ(y|x, t) +λs∇x log pt(x) (λs is classifier scale[13]), which is used in place of unconditional score ∇x log pt(x). Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier. The guidance classifiers participate in the sampling through their gradients, which indicate the pixel-wise perturbations that maximizes log-likelihood of the target class. Perceptually aligned gradients that resemble images from data distribution lead to meaningful pixel-wise perturbations that could potentially improve classifier-guidance and forms the motivation of Kawar et al. [27], where they propose an adversarial training recipe for guidance classifiers. With 7(a) PAG: Noisy-classifer vs DA-Classifier  (b) Generated Samples: Noisy-Classifier vs DA-Classifier Figure 4: (a) Min-max normalized gradients on clean samples (left column) diffused to t = 300 (T = 999). For easy comparison between Noisy classifier gradients (middle column) and DA-classifier gradients (right column), we applied an identical enhancement to both images, i.e. contrast maximization. The unedited gradients are shown in Fig. 16. (b) Qualitative Comparison of Guidance Classifiers on the Image Generation Task using DDIM-100 with same random seed. In each pair, the first image is generated with the Noisy Classifier and the second image is generated with the Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier. We observe that the Denoising- Augmented (DA) Classifier improves overall coherence as compared to the Noisy Classifier. Also see Fig. 21 in appendix for more examples. the same motivation, we instead build on Theorem 4.1 in order to improve perceptual alignment and propose to train guidance classifiers with denoised examples ˆxt derived from x. While the obvious choice is to simply train the guidance-classifier onˆxt instead of x, we choose to provide bothx as well as ˆxt as simultaneous inputs to the classifier and instead optimize LCE = Et,x[−log pϕ(y|x, ˆxt, t)] (compare with Eq. (8)). We preserve the noisy input since the primary goal of guidance classifiers is to classify noisy examples and this approach enables the model to flexibly utilize information from both inputs. We refer to guidance-classifiers trained using both x and ˆxt as denoising-augmented (DA) classifier and use noisy classifiers to refer to guidance-classifiers trained exclusively on x. Experiment setup. We conduct our experiments on CIFAR10 and Imagenet and evaluate the advantages of DA-Classifiers over noisy classifiers. While we use the same Imagenet diffusion model described in Section 4, we use the deep NCSN++ (continuous) model released by Song et al. [43] as the score-network for CIFAR10 (VE-Diffusion). As compared to the noisy classifier, the DA-classifier has an additional input-convolution layer to process the denoised input and is identical from the second layer onwards. We describe our classifier architectures and the training details in Appendix C.1. Table 3: Summary of Test Accura- cies for CIFAR10 and Imagenet: each test example is diffused to a random uniformly sampled dif- fusion time. Both classifiers are shown the same diffused example. Method CIFAR10 Imagenet Noisy Classifier 54.79 33.78 DA-Classifier 57.16 36.11 Classification Accuracy. We first compare guidance classifiers in terms of test accuracies as a measure of their generalization (Table 3) and find that DA-classifiers generalize better to the test data. Training classifiers with Gaussian perturbed examples often leads to under- fitting [54] explaining the lower test accuracy observed with noisy classifiers. Interestingly, the additional denoised example helps ad- dress the underfitting – for example, see Fig. 15 (in appendix). One explanation of this finding could be found in Chung et al. [9], where they distinguish between noisy examples and their corresponding denoised examples as being in the ambient space and on the image manifold respectively, under certain assumptions. To determine the relative importance of noisy and denoised examples in DA-classifiers, we zeroed out one of the input images to the CIFAR10 classifier and measured classification accuracies: while zeroing the noisy input caused the average accuracy across all time-scales to drop to 50.1%, zeroing the denoised input breaks the classifier completely yielding random predictions. Classifier Gradients. In Fig. 4a, we qualitatively compare between the noisy classifier gradients (∇x log pϕ(y|x, t)) and the DA-classifier gradients(∇x log pϕ(y|x, ˆx, t)). We find that the gradients obtained from the DA-classifier are more structured and semantically aligned with the clean image as compared to the ones obtained with the noisy classifier (see Figs. 16 and 18 in Appendix for more examples). Gradients backpropagated through the denoising score network have been previously utilized (e.g., [3, 9, 10, 17, 25, 33]), but our work is the first to observe and analyze the qualitative 8Table 4: Quantitative comparison of Guidance Classifiers on the Image Generation Task using 50k samples. We also show unconditional precision/recall (P/R) and the average class-conditional ePrecision/eRecall/eDensity/eCoverage.

Image Generation. To evaluate the guidance classifiers in terms of their image generation, we generate 50k images each – see Appendix C.2 for details on the sampling parameters. We com- pare the classifiers in terms of standard generative modeling metrics such as FID, IS, and P/R/D/C (Precision/Recall/Density/Coverage). The P/R/D/C metrics compare between the manifold of gen- erated distribution and manifold of the source distribution in terms of nearest-neighbours and can be computed conditionally (i.e., classwise) or unconditionally. Following standard practice, we additionally evaluate CIFAR10 classifiers on class-conditional P/R/D/C. Our results (Table 4) show that our proposed Denoising-Augmented (DA) Classifier improves upon the Noisy Classifier in terms of FID and IS for both CIFAR10 and Imagenet at roughly same Precision and Recall levels (see Appendix C.3 for comparison with baselines). Our evaluation of average class-conditional precision, recall, density and coverage for each CIFAR10 class also shows that DA-classifiers outperform Noisy classifiers: for example, DA-classifiers yield classwise density and coverage of about 0.92 and 0.77 respectively on average as compared to 0.78 and 0.71 obtained with Noisy-Classifiers. We can attribute our improvements in the class-conditional precision, recall, density and coverage to the improved generalization of DA-classifier. To qualitatively analyse benefits of the DA-classifier, we generated Imagenet samples using DDIM-100 sampler with identical random seeds and λs = 2.5. In our resulting analysis, we consistently observed that the DA-classifier maintains more coherent fore- ground and background as compared to the Noisy Classifier. We show examples in Fig. 4b. Overall, we attribute improved image generation to the improved generalization and classifier gradients. 6 Related Works Synthetic Augmentation with Diffusion Models have also been explored to train semi-supervised classifiers [50] and few-shot learning [47]. Other studies on training classifiers with synthetic datasets generated with a text2image diffusion model include [4, 21, 51]. Apart from being computationally expensive, such text2image diffusion models are trained on large-scale upstream datasets and some of the reported improvements could also be attributed to the quality of the upstream dataset. Instead, we propose a efficient diffusion-based augmentation method and report improvements using a diffusion model trained with no extra data. In principle, DiffAug is complementary to synthetic training data generated with text2image diffusion models and we leave further analysis as future work. Diffusion Models for Robust Classification. Diffusion-classifier [29] is a method for zero-shot classification but also improves robustness to covariate shifts. Diff-TTA[35] is a test-time adaptation technique to update the classifier parameters at test time and is complementary to classifier training techniques such as DiffAug. In terms of OOD detection, previous works have proposed reconstruction- based metrics for ood detection [ 19, 30]. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate improved OOD detection on Imagenet using diffusion models. 7 Conclusion In this work, we introduce DiffAug to train robust classifiers with one-step diffusion denoised examples. The simplicity and computational efficiency of DiffAug enables us to also extend other data augmentation techniques, where we find that DiffAug confers additional robustness without affecting accuracy on clean examples. We qualitatively analyse DiffAug samples in an attempt to explain improved robustness. Furthermore, we extend DiffAug to test time and introduce an efficient test-time image adaptation technique to further improve robustness to covariate shifts. Finally, we 9theoretically analyse perceptually aligned gradients in denoised examples and use this to improve classifier-guided diffusion.

Limitations and Future Work In this work, we introduced DiffAug, a simple diffusion-based augmentation technique to improve classifier robustness. While we presented a unified training scheme, we follow previous works and evaluate robustness to covariate shifts, adversarial examples and out-of-distribution detection using separate evaluation pipelines (for e.g., we do not apply DDA on OOD examples). A unified evaluation pipeline for classifier robustness is an open problem and out of scope for this paper. The key advantage of our method is its computational efficiency since it requires just one reverse diffusion step to generate the augmentations; however, this is computationally more expensive than handcrafted augmentation techniques such as AugMix. Nevertheless, it is fast enough that we can generate the augmentations online during each training step. With recent advances in distilling diffusion models for fast sampling [31] such as Consistency-Models [44], it may be possible to generate better quality synthetic examples within the training loop. Since the improved robustness introduced by DiffAug can be attributed to the augmentations of varying image quality (Fig. 1), we believe that 12this complementary regularization effect can still be valuable with efficient high-quality sampling and leave further exploration to future work. Likewise, DiffAug is complementary to the use of additional synthetic data generated offline with text2image diffusion models and the extension of DiffAug to text2image diffusion models is suitable for future investigation. We also extend DiffAug to test time and propose DE, wherein we demonstrate improvements comparable to DDA at 10x wallclock time on all classifiers except ViT on Imagenet-C; while this demonstrates a limitation of single-step denoising (i.e., DE) vs. multi-step denoising(i.e., DDA), we also note that DE improves over DDA for all classifiers when considering Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S. While we demonstrate improvements over existing baselines of classifier-guidance (e.g., [6, 27, 53]), we do not compare with classifier-free guidance [24], the popular guidance method, since our primary focus is on the training of robust classifiers with DiffAug and demonstrating the potential of DiffAug. Training classifier-guided diffusion models for careful comparison requires additional computational resources and we leave this analysis to future work. Nevertheless, classifier-guidance is a computationally attractive alternative to perform conditional generation since this allows flexible reuse of a pretrained diffusion model for different class-definitions by separately training a small classifier model. We also note that computing classifier-gradients is slower for DA-classifiers as compared to noisy classifiers since it requires backpropagating through the score-network and shares this limitation with other recent works that utilize intermediate denoised examples for guidance (e.g., Bansal et al. [3], Chung et al. [9, 10], Ho et al. [25]) – the recent advances in efficient diffusion sampling could be extended to class-conditional sampling to reduce the gap. Compute Resources For this paper, we had access to 8 40GB A40 GPUs to conduct our training and evaluation. We used a maximum of 4 GPUs for each job and the longest training job was the 90-epoch RN-50 training followed by the 20-epoch ViT training. The evaluation of classifiers on Imagenet-C, Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S using DE and Default evaluation modes are fairly fast. However, generating DDA examples for the entire Imagenet-C dataset and Imagenet-test dataset is computationally expensive and takes up to a week (even while using 8 GPUs in parallel) and also requires sufficient storage capacity to save the DDA-transformed images. Likewise, evaluation of certified accuracy with DDS is also computationally expensive since it uses 10k noise samples per example to estimate the certified radius and prediction. Training CIFAR10 guidance classifiers are fairly efficient while finetuning the Imagenet guidance classifier can take up to 3 days depending on the gradient accumulation parameter (i.e., number of GPUs available) – when available, we used a maximum of 4 GPUs. On average, the 50k CIFAR10 and Imagenet images that we sample for evaluation of guidance classifiers can be done within a maximum of 36 hours depending on how we parallelize the generation. Broader Impact The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new augmentation method using diffusion models to improve classifier robustness. With increasing deployment of deep learning models in real-world settings, improved robustness is crucial to enable safe and trustworthy deployment. Since we demonstrate potential of diffusion models trained with no extra data as compared to the classifier, we anticipate that this will be useful in applications where such extra data is not easily available (e.g., medical imaging). We also extend this method to improve classifier-guided diffusion. Improvements in classifier-guided diffusion can be used in developing a myriad downstream applications, each with their own potential balance of positive and negative impacts. Leveraging and re-using a pre-trained model amplifies the importance of giving proper consideration to copyright issues associated with the data on which that model was trained. While our proposed model has the potential for generating deep-fakes or disinformation, these technologies also hold promise for positive applications, including creativity-support tools and design aids in engineering. 13A Appendix for Section 3 Figure 5: A demonstration of the DiffAug technique using a Toy 2D dataset. Figure 6: A zoomed-in view demonstrating the transformation considering a single train point. Original  Color Augmented Manifold Intrusion from Color Augmentation Figure 7: Example of Manifold Intrusion from Appendix C of Hendrycks et al. [23]. While DiffAug may alter class labels (Fig. 1), the denoised images are visually distinguishable from the original images allowing the model to also learn from noisy labels without inducing manifold intrusion. On the other hand, here is an example of manifold intrusion where the augmented image does not contain any visual cues that enable the model to be robust to noisy labels. B Appendix for Section 4 B.1 Training Details In the following, we describe the training details for the classifiers we evaluated in Section 4. In general, we optimize a sum of two losses: LTotal = 0.5 ∗ (LOrig + L) where, LOrig is the classification objective on the original augmentation policy that we aim to improve using DiffAug examples and L denotes the classification objective measured on DiffAug examples (Eq. (5)). Before applying 14DiffAug, we first resized the raw image such that at least one of the edges is of size 256 and then use a 224 × 224 center-crop as the test image since the diffusion model was not trained on random resized crops. • RN-50: We trained the model from scratch for 90 epochs using the same optimization hyperparameters used to train the official PyTorch RN-50 checkpoint. • ViT: We used the two-stage training recipe proposed in DeIT-III. In particular, the training recipe consists of an 800-epoch supervised pretraining at a lower resolution (e.g., 192×192) followed by a 20-epoch finetuning at the target resolution (e.g., 224×224). Starting with the pretrained checkpoint (i.e., after 800 epochs), we finetune the classifier exactly following the prescribed optimization and augmentation hyperparameters (e.g., AutoAugment (AA) parameters and MixUp/CutMix parameters) except that we also consider DiffAug examples. We also included DiffAug examples when applying MixUp/CutMix since we observed significant drops in standard test accuracies when training directly on DiffAug examples without label-smoothing or MixUp. We briefly explored stacking DiffAug with AA and identified that this did not introduce any noticeable change as compared to independent application of DiffAug and AA to train examples. • AugMix/DeepAugment/DeepAugment+AugMix: To evaluate the combination of DiffAug with these augmentations, we finetune the RN-50 checkpoint opensourced by the respective papers for 10 epochs with a batch-size of 256. We resume the training with the optimizer state made available along with the model weights and use a constant learning rate of 1e-6. B.2 More Results on Covariate Shift Robustness Table 5: ImageNet-C (severity=5) accuracy for each corruption type. Relative Improvements when additionally using diffusion denoised augmentations are computed with respect to the corresponding pretrained checkpoints and averaged across all corruption types. Overall, we observe improvements for each family of corruptions: in the default evaluation mode, we observe an average absolute improvement of 2.5%, 4.9%,1.0% and 0.76% for the Noise, Blur, Weather and Digital corruptions respectively. Across all evaluation modes, we observe an average absolute improvement of 1.86%, 4.74%, 1.67%, 1.51% for the Noise, Blur, Weather and Digital corruptions respectively.

The AUROC is a threshold-free evaluation of OOD detection while FPR@TPR95 measures the false positive rate at which OOD samples are incorrectly identified as in-distribution samples given that the true positive rate of detecting in-distribution samples correctly is 95%. The Near-OOD Imagenet task as defined by OpenOOD consists of SSB-Hard and NINCO datasets and we also include the performance for each dataset in the following tables. 0 200 400 600 800 t 0 2 4 6Entropy (nats) Maximum Entropy ViT ViT+DiffAug RN50 RN50+DiffAug Figure 9: The entropy plots for ViT and RN50 are shown where we observe similar trends as in Fig. 2.

Here, we observe comparable performance although we notice slight improvements in detection rates. We do not show the results for other OOD algorithms since we found those results to be significantly worse than simple MSP. This may be because the OOD research is mainly focused on deep convolution architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet. Train Augmentation AUROC FPR95 SSB-Hard NINCO Avg. SSB-Hard NINCO Avg.

B.5.1 Extra Training We train the pretrained AugMix checkpoint for extra 10 epochs to isolate the improvement obtained by DiffAug finetuning. In Table 13, we analyse the OOD detection performance as well as the robustness to covariate shift (Imagenet-C, Imagenet-R and Imagenet-S) finding no notable difference as compared to the results in Tables 1, 2 and 6. B.5.2 DiffAug Hyperparameters The time range used to generate the DiffAug train augmentations constitutes the key hyperparameter and we analyse and compare between weaker DiffAug augmentations (t ∈ [0, 500]) and stronger DiffAug augmentations (t ∈ [500, 999]). From Table 13, we find that both weak and strong DiffAug augmentations complement each other and contribute to different aspects of robustness. Overall, using the entire diffusion time range to generate DiffAug yields consistent improvements. 18Table 13: Ablation Analysis. (a) Top-1 Accuracy(%) on ImageNet-C (severity=5) and ImageNet-Test. We observe that extra AugMix training does not introduce any remarkable difference with respect to the pretrained checkpoint allowing us to clearly attribute the improved robustness to DiffAug. Further, we also analyse the choice of diffusion time-range for generating the DiffAug augmentations and find that the stronger DiffAug augmentations generated with t ∈ [500, 999] enhances robustness to Imagenet-C as compared to DiffAug [0, 500] while obtaining slightly lower accuracy on Imagenet-Test in DE and DDA evaluation modes. Using the entire diffusion time-scale tends to achieve the right balance between both. ImageNet-C (severity = 5) ImageNet-Test Train Augmentations DDA DDA (SE) DE Def. Avg DDA DDA (SE) DE Def.

B.7 Derivation of Theorem 4.1 For the forward-diffusion SDEs considered in this paper, the marginal distribution pt(x) can be expressed in terms of the data distribution p(x0): pt(x) = Z x0 pt(x|x0)p(x0)dx0 (9) where pt(x|x0) =N(x | µ(x0, t), σ2(t)I). If we denote µ(x0, t) by mt, we can rewrite pt(x) as pt(x) = Z mt pt(x|mt)p(mt)dmt since µ is linear and invertible. The optimal score-functionsθ∗(x, t) =∇x log pt(x) can be simplified as: sθ∗(x, t) = 1 pt(x) Z mt mt − x σ2(t) pt(x|mt) p(mt)dmt (10) 20Figure 12: CIFAR10 examples used for SVD Analysis Using Eq (10), we can rewrite the denoised example, ˆxt = x + σ2(t)sθ(x, t), as: ˆxt = 1 pt(x) Z mt mt pt(x|mt) p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt = E[mt|x] (11) That is, the denoised example ˆxt is in fact the expected value of the mean mt given input x. (See also Eq (4) in the main text ). To compute ∂ˆxt ∂x , we algebraically simplify R mt mt∇x \u0010 pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0011 p(mt)dmt as follows: ∂ˆxt ∂x = Z mt mt \u0012∇xpt(x|mt) pt(x) − pt(x|mt)∇xpt(x) p2 t (x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt \u0012pt(x|mt) pt(x) mt − x σ2(t) − pt(x|mt)∇x log pt(x) pt(x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012mt − x σ2(t) − ∇x log pt(x) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012mt − x − σ2(t)∇x log pt(x) σ2(t) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mt pt(x|mt) pt(x) \u0012 mt σ2(t) − x + σ2(t)∇x log pt(x) σ2(t) \u0013⊤ p(mt)dmt = Z mt mtm⊤ t σ2(t) pt(mt|x)dmt − \u0012Z mt mt pt(mt|x)dmt \u0013 ˆx⊤ t σ2(t) = 1 σ2(t) \u0012Z mt mtm⊤ t pt(mt|x)dmt − ˆxtˆx⊤ t \u0013 = 1 σ2(t) \u0000 E[mtm⊤ t |x] − E[mt|x]E[mt|x]⊤\u0001 = 1 σ2(t)Cov[mt|x] (12) B.8 Analysis with SVD Decomposition Considering the CIFAR10 images in Fig. 12, we compute the 3072×3072 jacobian matrix J and then apply SVD decomposition J = USV using default settings in PyTorch. Then, we visualise — after min-max normalization — the columns of U and rows of V along with the (batch-averaged) value in the diagonal matrix S of the corresponding row/column. We find that the principal components of the jacobian matrix are perceptually aligned and provides additional intuition for Theorem 4.1.

C.1 Guidance Classifier Training: Experiment Details We use the pretrained noisy Imagenet classifier released by Dhariwal and Nichol [13] while we trained the noisy CIFAR10 classifier ourselves; the Imagenet classifier is the downsampling half of the UNET with attention pooling classifier-head while we use WideResNet-28-2 as the architecture for CIFAR10. For the DA-classifier, we simply add an extra convolution that can process the denoised input: for Imagenet, we finetune the pretrained noisy classifier by adding an additional input-convolution module while we train the denoising-augmented CIFAR10 classifier from scratch. The details of the optimization are as follows: (1) for Imagenet, we fine-tune the entire network along with the new convolution-module (initialized with very small weights) using AdamW optimizer with a learning-rate of 1e-5 and a weight-decay of 0.05 for 50k steps with a batch size of 128. (2) For CIFAR10, we train both noisy and DA-classifiers for 150k steps with a batch size of 512 using AdamW optimizer with a learning-rate of 3e-4 and weight decay of 0.05. For CIFAR10 classifiers, we use the Exponential Moving Average of the parameters with decay-rate equal to 0.999. 24Figure 16: Min-max normalized gradients on samples diffused to t = 300 (T = 999). Top panel: gradients obtained with noisy classifier. Bottom panel: gradients obtained with DA-classifier. Middle panel: corresponding clean Imagenet samples. We recommend zooming in to see differences between gradients, e.g. the clearer coherence in DA-classifier gradients. C.2 Classifier-Guided Diffusion: Sampling We use a PC sampler as described in Song et al. [43] with 1000 discretization steps for CIFAR10 samples while we use a DDIM [42] sampler with 25 discretization steps for Imagenet samples. We use the 256x256 class-conditional diffusion model open-sourced by Dhariwal and Nichol [12] for our Imagenet experiments and set the classifier scale λs = 2.5 following their experimental setup for DDIM-25 samples. The classifier-scale is set to 1.0 for CIFAR10 experiments. 25Figure 17: The figure shows the total derivative dlog pϕ(y|x,ˆxt,t) dx = ∂log pϕ ∂x + ∂log pϕ ∂ˆxt ∂ˆxt ∂x , the partial derivative with respect to noisy input ∂ log pϕ ∂x , the partial derivative with respect to denoised input ∂ log pϕ ∂ˆx , and ∂ log pϕ ∂ˆx ∂ˆxt ∂x .

Since Chao et al. [6] use ResNet18 backbones for their CIFAR10 experiments, we train a separate DA- Classifier for these comparisons. We compare between FID, IS and also compare the unconditional precision and recall (P/R) and the average class-conditional ePrecision/eRecall/eDensity/eCoverage.We obtain our results for Noisy Classifier (CE) and Noisy Classifier (DLSM) from Table 2 of Chao et al. [6]. While the FID and IS scores are comparable, we note that our class-wise Precision, Recall, Density and Coverage metrics are either comparable or demonstrate a significant improvement.

[53] propose two complementary techniques to improve over vanilla classifier-guidance: Entropy-Constraint Training (ECT) and Entropy-Driven Sampling (EDS). ECT consists of adding an additional loss term to the cross-entropy loss encouraging the predictions to be closer to uniform distribution (similar to the label-smoothing loss). EDS modifies the sampling to use a diffusion-time dependent scaling factor designed to address premature vanishing guidance-gradients. The sampling method (EDS/Vanilla) can be chosen independent of the training method (determined by the loss-objective and classifier-inputs). In the following, we compare between ECT and DA-Classifiers using Vanilla Sampling method using the results in Table 3 of Zheng et al.[53]. As the robust-classifier [27] was not evaluated for Imagenet-256, we fine-tuned the open-source checkpoint using the open-source code provided by robust-guidance for 50k steps with learning rate=1e-5 We observe that DA-Classifier obtains better FID/IS than both ECT and Robust-Guidance.

    "method": "Motivation\nWhy it matters\n1. “Ship-once, run-everywhere” diffusion models fail in the wild. Real-world cameras differ in colour primaries, black-level, JPEG tone-curves, rolling-shutter blur, etc. A single cloud-trained backbone (SD-XL, DiT-XL) therefore degrades sharply on-edge. Existing PEFT methods (LoRA, Diff-Tuning) do fix the problem but at the cost of minutes of GPU time, privacy-sensitive data upload, and >30 W power draw—unacceptable for hospitals, AR glasses, drones, or rural phones.\n2. Prior analysis revealed a dominant Gaussian core in high-noise denoisers, yet no one has turned this observation into a *practical* calibration routine. The field still treats adaptation as an optimisation problem instead of an algebra problem.\n3. Global sustainability & privacy push. Regulators (EU AI Act, HIPAA) and battery constraints demand *on-device* customisation that is energy-frugal (<1 J) and data-sovereign (no upload).\n\nMethodology – Adaptive Moment Calibration (AMC)\nKey insight: at every noise level σ the pretrained denoiser fσ can be decomposed into (i) an *analytic* low-rank Gaussian filter Wσ and (ii) a nonlinear residual rθ that carries high-frequency style. If the target domain differs mostly in its first two moments (mean, covariance), one can recalibrate Wσ in closed form—no gradients, no re-compilation.\n\nStage 0  (once, offline)\nA. Spectral bundle distillation\n• Feed synthetic Gaussian noise through fσ for K≃20 discrete σ k; solve the normal equations to obtain full-rank weight matrices Wσ∈ℝ^{d×d} (d=pixels).\n• Jointly compress {Wσ} with a *shared* truncated SVD: Wσ≈U Dσ Uᵀ, rank r≤512. Store U (3 rd fp16 numbers) + {Dσ, μσ}. Disk cost <40 MB for 1k² images.\nB. Residual freezing\nRewrite forward pass: fσ(x)=μσ+U Dσ Uᵀ(x−μσ)+rθ(x,σ). During any future fine-tune we add λ‖rθ‖² so the split stays valid and publish “AMC-ready” checkpoints.\n\nStage 1  (on-device, ≈150 ms on a Snapdragon-8-Gen-2)\n1. Unlabelled moment estimation\n• Capture N≤128 target images, convert to linear-RGB, run 3-band DCT, compute empirical mean μ̂ and shrunk covariance Σ̂ (Ledoit–Wolf).\n2. Closed-form hot-swap\n• Project Σ̂ into the stored basis: α = UᵀΣ̂U (O(rd)).\n• For every σ compute new diag D̂σ = α(α+σ²I)⁻¹ (Wiener gain).\n• Replace (μσ,Dσ) with (μ̂,D̂σ) at runtime. No gradients, no kernels reloaded.\n3. Streaming EMA for video/bursts: update μ̂, α with decay ρ; footprint 10 kB.\n\nStage 2  (optional extensions)\n• Patch-AMC: estimate moments tile-wise (32×32); interpolate with Yule–Fisher to handle mixed lighting.\n• Operator-aware AMC: if a known blur/mosaic kernel H is given, set Σ̂←HHᵀ for *instant* restoration, an analytic zero-training analogue to Cold Diffusion.\n• Prompt-aware gating: for prompts containing colour/style words, blend between source and calibrated moments via CLIP-predicted α to avoid over-correction in stylised generations.\n\nWhy it is novel\n• Cold Diffusion retrains a network per degradation; AMC keeps the backbone frozen and swaps first-order terms analytically.\n• PEFT (LoRA, Diff-Tuning) is optimisation-based; AMC is optimisation-free and ≈10³× cheaper.\n• “Hidden Gaussian Bias” was purely diagnostic; AMC operationalises it with a universal SVD basis and a millisecond hot-swap.\n• Negative-transfer clustering tackles *training* interference; AMC edits only the *forward* pass and therefore incurs zero extra training time.\n\nTheoretical guarantee\nFor any Euler–Maruyama sampler with noise levels {σ_k}, substituting (μσ,Dσ) by (μ̂,D̂σ) yields\n  KL(p̂‖p*) ≤ max_k‖Σ̂−Σ*‖₂ · σ_k^{-3}(1+o(1)),\nso calibration error shrinks cubically with noise level. Proof follows direct Gaussian score-matching.\n\nImplementation footprint\n• Code change: <300 lines (PyTorch/TensorRT). Works as a nn.Module wrapper—drop-in for diffusers pipelines.\n• RAM: +5 MB (fp16 U, α, μ̂ cache). CPU only; no GPU mandatory.\n• Energy: <0.7 J for N=128 calibration images on mobile CPU.\n\nEvaluation plan\n1. Benchmarks: real-camera RAW-to-SDXL transfer, low-light smartphone set, and NIH Chest-X-ray → improve SSIM / FID vs vanilla & LoRA.\n2. Latency/energy: compare AMC (CPU, 150 ms, <1 J) vs LoRA (GPU cloud, >120 s, >200 J).\n3. Privacy: simulate hospital policy—no pixel leaves device; AMC passes, PEFT fails.\n4. Ablations: rank r, number of calibration images, shrinkage strength, EMA decay.\n\nExpected impact\n1. Makes every large diffusion checkpoint a “universal backbone” that *end-users* can personalise in <1 s without GPUs or cloud, critical for medical, military, and mobile-AR deployments.\n2. Cuts adaptation energy by ~10³× and latency to sub-second CPU time, paving the way for creative and vision-AI pipelines on phones, drones and wearables.\n3. Opens a new research direction: *analytic* diffusion adaptation. We will open-source code, an AMC-ready SD-XL checkpoint, and a mobile benchmark suite to seed follow-up work.\n4. Conceptually bridges batch-norm (mean/var swap) and score-based diffusion, hinting at future architectures exposing interpretable, swappable statistics for even richer on-device personalisation.",

Pick 3 different cameras (Canon 5D, Nikon D700, Sony A7) as held-out domains.\n\nBaselines\n1. Vanilla, no adaptation.\n2. LoRA fine-tuning (rank 4, 500 steps) — best-practice PEFT.\n3. Batch-Norm statistics swap (\"AdaIN\") — cheap but naïve.\n\nMetrics\n• FID (StyleGAN version) between generated images and target-camera photos (prompt set = 100 captions from COCO Captions, same random seeds for all methods).\n• ΔCIEDE2000 in a grey-card patch rendered by each method (isolates colour-cast error).\n• Run-time & energy via pyRAPL (CPU) + nvidia-smi (GPU).\n\nProcedure (≈200 loc, pure Python)\n1. Stage-0 (once, offline, GPU desktop)  \n   a. Sample 1 k Gaussian-noise images, pass through SD-XL denoiser fσ (20 σ-levels).  \n   b. Solve normal equations → Wσ.  \n   c. Joint SVD, store U, {Dσ, μσ}.  (save as torch.ckpt ~40 MB)\n2. Stage-1 (per camera, on laptop CPU @1.5 GHz ≈ mobile)  \n   a. Read 64 RAW frames ➜ linear RGB ➜ 3-band DCT ➜  μ̂, Σ̂ (Ledoit-Wolf, sklearn.covariance).  \n   b. Compute α = UᵀΣ̂U; derive D̂σ analytically.  \n   c. Hot-swap (μσ,Dσ) → (μ̂,D̂σ) inside nn.Module wrapper (no torch.compile).  \n   d. Time entire block with Python’s time.perf_counter & pyRAPL.\n3. Generation  \n   • 100 COCO prompts × 4 seeds × 3 methods → 1 200 images/method.\n4. Evaluation  \n   • Run torch-fid to get FID vs real FiveK images, per camera.  \n   • Locate a neutral 32×32 patch (FiveK provides calibrated grey patch) ➜ compute CIEDE2000.\n\nExpected outcome\n• FID↓ 20–30 % vs Vanilla, equal or better than LoRA while using <1 J and <0.2 s vs ≈200 J & >2 min for LoRA.\n• Colour error ΔE00 < 2 (“imperceptible”) for AMC; >6 for Vanilla.\n\n\n=================================================\nEXPERIMENT 2 — ENERGY-LATENCY BENCHMARK ON MOBILE-CLASS SOC\n=================================================\nGoal\nQuantify AMC’s power/latency advantage over gradient-based PEFT on the same Snapdragon-8-Gen-2 development kit.\n\nSetup\n• Board: Qualcomm RB3 Gen-2, Android 13, Python 3.10 in Termux, PyTorch 2.1 aarch64, no GPU access (Adreno kept idle).\n• Power meter: INA226 over I²C @ 1 kHz logged through pyenergy-monitor.\n\nWorkloads\n1. AMC calibration (N = 128 images).  \n2. LoRA fine-tuning (rank 4) for the same 128 images, 100 steps, fp16 AdamW.\n\nProcedure\n1. Push identical calibration set (FiveK Nikon D700) to /sdcard/.  \n2. Reset coulomb counter; run workload; stop counter.  \n3. Repeat 5×; report mean ± σ.\n\nMetrics\n• Wall-clock latency (s).  \n• Energy (J) = ∑ V·I·Δt.  \n• Thermal headroom (max die °C) via Android thermald.\n\nFeasible Python code snippets\n```\nwith EnergyMeter() as m:\n    amc.calibrate(img_batch)       #  < 0.2 s\nprint(m.joules)\n```\nEquivalent loop with LoRA uses PEFT library.\n\nExpected outcome\n• AMC: ≈150 ms, 0.7 J, ΔT ≈ +2 °C.  \n• LoRA: >120 s, >250 J, ΔT ≈ +18 °C ➜ throttles.\n\n\n=================================================\nEXPERIMENT 3 — ABLATION & ROBUSTNESS GRID\n=================================================\nGoal\nUnderstand how AMC behaves w.r.t. key hyper-parameters and show cubic error decay predicted by theory.\n\nGrid\n• Rank r ∈ {32, 64, 128, 256, 512}.  \n• #Calibration images N ∈ {4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}.  \n• Noise level σ ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2} (evaluated in cold-diffusion denoising).\n\nDataset\n• Synthetic Gaussian blur + colour-cast on ImageNet-V2 (10 k images). Ground-truth clean images available ⇒ easy PSNR/SSIM computation.\n\nProcedure (Python, 1 GPU overnight)\n1. Create degraded set for each σ.  \n2. For every (r,N) pair: estimate μ̂, Σ̂ from first N images ➜ apply AMC ➜ run denoising sampler ➜ compute PSNR, SSIM.\n3. Fit log-log line of (‖Σ̂−Σ*‖₂) vs PSNR drop to verify σ⁻³ trend.\n\nVisualisations\n• Heat-map PSNR(r,N).  \n• Curve of error vs σ with cubic fit.  \n• Attention maps of residual rθ confirm it stays small (‖rθ‖² regulariser working).\n\nExpected findings\n• PSNR saturates beyond rank 256 or N ≈ 64 (practical default).  \n• Error ∝ σ³ as theorem predicts (R² > 0.95).  \n• Residual energy <5 % of total, validating Gaussian-core assumption.\n\n================================================================\nAll three experiments are fully reproducible in <1 000 Python lines, need only public data and off-the-shelf libraries (torch, diffusers, peft, sklearn, pyRAPL). Together they showcase accuracy, efficiency, and theoretical soundness of Adaptive Moment Calibration.",
